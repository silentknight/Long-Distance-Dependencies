 Homarus gammarus , known as the European lobster or common lobster , is a species of <unk> lobster from the eastern Atlantic Ocean , Mediterranean Sea and parts of the Black Sea . It is closely related to the American lobster , H. americanus . It may grow to a length of 60 cm ( 24 in ) and a mass of 6 kilograms ( 13 lb ) , and bears a conspicuous pair of claws . In life , the lobsters are blue , only becoming " lobster red " on cooking . Mating occurs in the summer , producing eggs which are carried by the females for up to a year before hatching into <unk> larvae . Homarus gammarus is a highly esteemed food , and is widely caught using lobster pots , mostly around the British Isles . 
 Homarus gammarus is a large <unk> , with a body length up to 60 centimetres ( 24 in ) and weighing up to 5 – 6 kilograms ( 11 – 13 lb ) , although the lobsters caught in lobster pots are usually 23 – 38 cm ( 9 – 15 in ) long and weigh 0 @.@ 7 – 2 @.@ 2 kg ( 1 @.@ 5 – 4 @.@ 9 lb ) . Like other crustaceans , lobsters have a hard <unk> which they must shed in order to grow , in a process called <unk> ( <unk> ) . This may occur several times a year for young lobsters , but decreases to once every 1 – 2 years for larger animals . 
 The first pair of <unk> is armed with a large , asymmetrical pair of claws . The larger one is the " <unk> " , and has rounded <unk> used for crushing prey ; the other is the " cutter " , which has sharp inner edges , and is used for holding or tearing the prey . Usually , the left claw is the <unk> , and the right is the cutter . 
 The <unk> is generally blue above , with spots that <unk> , and yellow below . The red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking . This occurs because , in life , the red pigment <unk> is bound to a protein complex , but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking , releasing the red pigment . 
 The closest relative of H. gammarus is the American lobster , Homarus americanus . The two species are very similar , and can be crossed artificially , although hybrids are unlikely to occur in the wild since their ranges do not overlap . The two species can be distinguished by a number of characteristics : 
 The <unk> of H. americanus bears one or more spines on the underside , which are lacking in H. gammarus . 
 The spines on the claws of H. americanus are red or red @-@ tipped , while those of H. gammarus are white or white @-@ tipped . 
 The underside of the claw of H. americanus is orange or red , while that of H. gammarus is creamy white or very pale red . 
 Female H. gammarus reach sexual maturity when they have grown to a carapace length of 80 – 85 millimetres ( 3 @.@ 1 – 3 @.@ 3 in ) , whereas males mature at a slightly smaller size . Mating typically occurs in summer between a recently <unk> female , whose shell is therefore soft , and a hard @-@ shelled male . The female carries the eggs for up to 12 months , depending on the temperature , attached to her <unk> . Females carrying eggs are said to be " <unk> " and can be found throughout the year . 
 The eggs hatch at night , and the larvae swim to the water surface where they drift with the ocean currents , preying on <unk> . This stage involves three <unk> and lasts for 15 – 35 days . After the third moult , the juvenile takes on a form closer to the adult , and adopts a <unk> lifestyle . The juveniles are rarely seen in the wild , and are poorly known , although they are known to be capable of digging extensive burrows . It is estimated that only 1 larva in every 20 @,@ 000 survives to the <unk> phase . When they reach a carapace length of 15 mm ( 0 @.@ 59 in ) , the juveniles leave their burrows and start their adult lives . 
 Homarus gammarus is found across the north @-@ eastern Atlantic Ocean from northern Norway to the Azores and Morocco , not including the Baltic Sea . It is also present in most of the Mediterranean Sea , only missing from the section east of Crete , and along only the north @-@ west coast of the Black Sea . The <unk> populations are found in the Norwegian <unk> <unk> and <unk> , inside the Arctic Circle . 
 The species can be divided into four genetically distinct populations , one widespread population , and three which have diverged due to small effective population sizes , possibly due to adaptation to the local environment . The first of these is the population of lobsters from northern Norway , which have been referred to as the " midnight @-@ sun lobster " . The populations in the Mediterranean Sea are distinct from those in the Atlantic Ocean . The last distinct population is found in the Netherlands : samples from the <unk> were distinct from those collected in the North Sea or English Channel . 
 Attempts have been made to introduce H. gammarus to New Zealand , alongside other European species such as the edible crab , Cancer <unk> . Between 1904 and 1914 , one million lobster larvae were released from <unk> in <unk> , but the species did not become established there . 
 Adult H. gammarus live on the continental shelf at depths of 0 – 150 metres ( 0 – <unk> ft ) , although not normally deeper than 50 m ( 160 ft ) . They prefer hard substrates , such as rocks or hard mud , and live in holes or crevices , emerging at night to feed . 
 The diet of H. gammarus mostly consists of other <unk> invertebrates . These include crabs , molluscs , sea <unk> , <unk> and polychaete worms . 
 The three <unk> lobster species Homarus gammarus , H. americanus and <unk> <unk> are hosts to the three known species of the animal <unk> <unk> ; the species on H. gammarus has not been described . 
 Homarus gammarus is susceptible to the disease <unk> , caused by the <unk> <unk> <unk> . Although it is frequently found in American lobsters , the disease has only been seen in captive H. gammarus , where prior occupation of the tanks by H. americanus could not be ruled out . 
 Homarus gammarus is traditionally " highly esteemed " as a <unk> and was mentioned in " The <unk> " a seventeenth century English folk song . It may fetch very high prices and may be sold fresh , frozen , canned or powdered . Both the claws and the abdomen of H. gammarus contain " excellent " white meat , and most of the contents of the cephalothorax are edible . The exceptions are the <unk> mill and the " sand vein " ( gut ) . The price of H. gammarus is up to three times higher than that of H. americanus , and the European species is considered to have a better flavour . 
 <unk> are mostly fished using lobster pots , although lines <unk> with <unk> or <unk> sometimes succeed in tempting them out , to allow them to be caught in a net or by hand . In 2008 , 4 @,@ 386 t of H. gammarus were caught across Europe and North Africa , of which 3 @,@ 462 t ( 79 % ) was caught in the British Isles ( including the Channel Islands ) . The minimum landing size for H. gammarus is a carapace length of 87 mm ( 3 @.@ 4 in ) . 
 Homarus gammarus was first given a binomial name by Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema <unk> , published in 1758 . That name was Cancer gammarus , since Linnaeus ' concept of the genus Cancer at that time included all large crustaceans . 
 H. gammarus is the type species of the genus Homarus Weber , 1795 , as determined by Direction 51 of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature . Prior to that direction , confusion arose because the species had been referred to by several different names , including <unk> <unk> <unk> , 1775 and Homarus vulgaris H. Milne @-@ Edwards , 1837 , and also because Friedrich Weber 's description of the genus had been overlooked until rediscovered by Mary <unk> , rendering any prior assignments of type species ( for Homarus H. Milne @-@ Edwards , 1837 ) invalid for Homarus Weber , 1795 . 
 The type specimen of Homarus gammarus was a <unk> selected by <unk> <unk> in 1974 . It came from 57 ° 53 ′ N 11 ° 32 ′ E , near <unk> , Sweden ( 48 kilometres or 30 miles northwest of Gothenburg ) , but both it and the <unk> have since been lost . 
 The common name for H. gammarus preferred by the Food and Agriculture Organization is " European lobster " , but the species is also widely known as the " common lobster " .

Against the wishes of his parents he joined the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) as an air cadet on 16 January 1934 . He underwent flying instruction with No. 1 Flying Training School ( <unk> ) at RAAF Point Cook , Victoria , and was commissioned as a pilot officer on 1 January 1935 . 
 After completing a conversion course , <unk> was assigned to the <unk> Squadron at Point Cook . No larger than a flight according to the official history of the pre @-@ war RAAF , <unk> Squadron was part of No. 1 <unk> and operated <unk> Southampton flying boats and de Havilland <unk> Moth <unk> , among other types . During this posting <unk> was promoted to flying officer , on 1 July 1935 , and wrote a paper on national defence in which he suggested that with " strong air forces , naval forces ( including submarines ) , and fixed defences , Australia may be made practically <unk> " . According to Air Force historian Alan Stephens , this paper " in effect , defined the ' anti @-@ <unk> ' concept which has been a persistent feature of RAAF strategic thinking " . 
 <unk> completed a flying instructors course in July 1936 and joined the staff of No. 1 <unk> . He was promoted to flight lieutenant on 1 March 1937 . <unk> in July 1938 , he was one of six students to take part in the RAAF 's first Long <unk> Navigation Course , run by Flight <unk> Bill <unk> and <unk> Murdoch at Point Cook . The course involved several epic training flights that attracted considerable media attention , including a twelve @-@ day , 10 @,@ 800 @-@ kilometre ( 6 @,@ 700 mi ) round @-@ Australia trip by three Avro Ansons , one of which was <unk> by <unk> , in November . The following month , <unk> led the three Ansons on a six @-@ day journey back and forth over Central Australia . He subsequently passed the navigation course with a special distinction . On 27 January 1939 he was posted to RAAF Station Laverton , Victoria , as a flight commander . He served initially with No. 2 Squadron , before transferring to No. 1 Squadron on 29 August . Both units operated Ansons . 
 Following the outbreak of World War II , No. 1 Squadron was engaged in convoy escort and maritime reconnaissance duties off south @-@ eastern Australia . <unk> continued to serve with the squadron as a flight commander until 15 January 1940 , when he was assigned to Headquarters Laverton as the station navigation officer . On 27 March he was posted to the staff of RAAF Headquarters , Melbourne . He was promoted to squadron leader on 1 June 1940 . Two weeks later he married Katherine Bridge at St Paul 's Anglican Church in <unk> ; the couple would have a son and a daughter . 
 <unk> remained in Darwin as <unk> of Operations at Headquarters North @-@ Western Area Command until 12 May 1942 , when he was posted to <unk> , Victoria , as commanding officer of No. 2 Air Navigation School , operating Ansons . No. 97 ( Reserve ) Squadron was formed from the school 's personnel in June . On 20 July 1943 , <unk> took command of No. 2 Air Observer School ( <unk> ) , also operating Ansons , at Mount Gambier , South Australia . He was promoted to group captain on 1 December 1943 , and was appointed the inaugural commanding officer of No. 3 <unk> , operating Ansons and <unk> Battles out of Port <unk> , on 9 December . After handing over command of No. 3 <unk> , he commenced studies at RAAF Staff School in Mount Martha , Victoria , on 2 October 1944 . He was appointed senior administrative staff officer at North @-@ Western Area Command on 12 January 1945 . 
 On 19 February 1952 , <unk> became senior air staff officer ( <unk> ) at Eastern Area Command in <unk> , New South Wales . During his term as <unk> , the RAAF began re @-@ <unk> with English Electric Canberra jet bombers and CAC Sabre jet fighters . The Air Force also underwent a major <unk> change , as it transitioned from a geographically based command @-@ and @-@ control system to one based on function , resulting in the establishment of Home ( operational ) , Training , and Maintenance <unk> . Eastern Area Command , considered a de facto operational headquarters owing to the <unk> of combat units under its control , was reorganised as Home Command in October 1953 . <unk> was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire ( OBE ) in the 1954 New Year Honours for his " exceptional ability and devotion to duty " . He was promoted to acting air <unk> in May . His appointment as aide @-@ de @-@ camp to Queen Elizabeth II was announced on 7 October 1954 . 
 <unk> was promoted to substantive air <unk> on 1 January 1955 . In November he was posted to RAAF Overseas Headquarters , London , and the following year undertook studies at the Imperial Defence College . Returning to Australia , he served as acting Air Member for Personnel at the Department of Air , Canberra , from 19 March to 21 October 1957 , between the terms of Air Vice <unk> Fred <unk> and Allan Walters , and again from 24 August 1959 to 28 March 1960 , between the terms of Walters and Air Vice Marshal Bill <unk> .

 M @-@ 82 is a state trunkline in the Lower Peninsula in the US state of Michigan that travels between <unk> and Howard City . The section between <unk> and Howard City travels through <unk> and along the southern edge of <unk> National Forest . The current version of M @-@ 82 is actually the second in the state ; the first usage appeared in the Upper Peninsula by 1919 . The Lower Peninsula routing has been in use since the 1920s . Various extensions and <unk> have shifted the terminus as far west as New Era or <unk> in the past . The current route was finalized in the late 1970s 
 The Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) , as a part of its maintenance responsibilities , tracks the volume of traffic using its roadways . These levels are expressed in terms of a metric called average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) , which is a calculation of the traffic along a segment of road for any average day of the year . In 2009 , the department 's measurements indicated that a segment of M @-@ 82 west of <unk> had the peak volume for the highway at 16 @,@ <unk> vehicles daily . The traffic nadir was 4 @,@ <unk> vehicles east of <unk> . In addition , MDOT has not had any section of the highway listed on the National Highway System , a network of roads important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility . 
 The first usage of M @-@ 82 was in the Upper Peninsula by July 1 , 1919 . The trunkline started at M @-@ 25 and ran north of <unk> to the vicinity of Eight Mile Corner . It was later replaced by M @-@ 48 in 1926 . 
 The current M @-@ 82 dates back to 1926 . It ran from US 31 in Hart to the northern junction of US 131 and M @-@ 46 in Howard City . The highway was routed through Ferry , <unk> and <unk> , replacing M @-@ 41 . In late 1936 , M @-@ 46 was extended along the section between <unk> and Howard City , forming a M @-@ 46 / M @-@ 82 concurrency to fill a gap in the M @-@ 46 routing . This concurrent section became just M @-@ 46 in 1938 , <unk> M @-@ 82 back to the northern M @-@ 37 junction in <unk> . The highway was moved to a new alignment west of Ferry in late 1947 or early 1948 . Instead of heading northwesterly to Hart , it was continued west to end in Shelby . 
 Numerous anime and manga publications have commented on <unk> 's character . Many reviewers commented on his <unk> and intelligence , and noted his transformation into a leader ; Anime News Network celebrated <unk> 's emergence as " an unlikely hero " in the <unk> storyline . <unk> has also been highly popular with the <unk> reader base , placing high in several popularity polls . Merchandise based on <unk> has been released , including action figures , key chains , and patches . 
 A light novel titled <unk> <unk> : A Cloud Drifting in Silent Darkness , written by <unk> <unk> and illustrated by <unk> , stars <unk> as the main character and narrator . The novel is set two years after the Fourth <unk> War , focusing on <unk> 's assignment as organizer of the newly formed <unk> Union to capture a rogue ninja who rules over the distant Land of Silence and attempts to establish a new world order ruled by the common people . It also explores his growing relationship with <unk> , culminating in him struggling to name his child with her , years after the end of the novel . 
 <unk> has ranked highly in the Weekly Shōnen Jump popularity polls for the series , continuously placing in the top ten and reaching fourth place in one poll . The last such poll was in 2011 , in which <unk> was in ninth place , behind <unk> and ahead of <unk> .

 Meridian is the sixth largest city in the state of Mississippi , in the United States . It is the county seat of Lauderdale County and the principal city of the Meridian , Mississippi <unk> Statistical Area . Along major highways , the city is 93 mi ( 150 km ) east of Jackson , Mississippi ; 154 mi ( <unk> km ) west of Birmingham , Alabama ; 202 mi ( 325 km ) northeast of New Orleans , Louisiana ; and 231 mi ( 372 km ) southeast of Memphis , Tennessee . 
 Established in 1860 , at the intersection of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad and Southern Railway of Mississippi , Meridian 's economy was built on the railways and goods transported on them , and it became a strategic trading center . During the American Civil War , General William <unk> Sherman burned much of the city to the ground in the Battle of Meridian ( February , 1864 ) . 
 <unk> after the war , the city entered a " Golden Age " it become the largest city in Mississippi between 1890 and 1930 , and a leading center for manufacturing in the South , with 44 trains arriving and departing daily . Union Station , built in 1906 , is now a multi @-@ modal center , giving access to the Meridian Transit System , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> , averaging 242 @,@ 360 passengers per year . Although the economy slowed with the decline of the railroad industry , the city has diversified , with healthcare , military , and manufacturing employing the most people in 2010 . The population within the city limits , according to 2008 census estimates , is 38 @,@ 232 , but a population of 232 @,@ 900 in a 45 @-@ mile ( 72 km ) radius and 526 @,@ 500 in a 65 @-@ mile ( 105 km ) radius , of which 104 @,@ 600 and 234 @,@ 200 people respectively are in the labor force , feed the economy of the city . 
 The area is served by two military facilities , Naval Air Station Meridian and Key Field , which provide over 4 @,@ 000 jobs . <unk> Meridian is home to the Regional Counter @-@ <unk> Training Academy ( <unk> ) and the first local Department of Homeland Security in the state . Key Field is named after brothers Fred and Al Key , who set a world endurance flight record in 1935 . The field is now home to the 186th Air <unk> Wing of the Air National Guard and a support facility for the <unk> Aviation Brigade of the Army National Guard . Rush Foundation Hospital is the largest non @-@ military employer in the region , employing 2 @,@ 610 people . 
 Among the city 's many arts organizations and historic buildings are the Riley Center , the Meridian Museum of Art , Meridian Little Theatre , and the Meridian Symphony Orchestra . Meridian was home to two Carnegie libraries , one for whites and one for African Americans . The Carnegie Branch Library , now demolished , was one of a number of Carnegie libraries built for blacks in the Southern United States during the segregation era . 
 Previously inhabited by the <unk> Native Americans , the area now called Meridian was obtained by the United States under the terms of the Treaty of Dancing <unk> Creek in 1830 during the period of Indian <unk> . After the treaty was ratified , European @-@ American settlers began to move into the area . 
 After receiving a federal land grant of about 2 @,@ 000 acres ( <unk> ha ) , Richard <unk> , the first settler of Meridian , began offering free land to newcomers to attract more settlers to the region and develop the area . Most of <unk> 's land was bought in 1853 by Lewis A. <unk> , a lawyer from Alabama . John T. Ball , a merchant from <unk> County , bought the remaining 80 acres ( 0 @.@ 32 km2 ) . <unk> and Ball , now known as the founders of the city , began laying out lots for new development on their respective land sections . 
 There was much competition over the proposed name of the settlement . Ball and the more industrial residents of the city supported the name " Meridian , " believing the term to be synonymous with " junction " ; the more agrarian residents of the city preferred " <unk> " ( meaning " mad river " in a Native American language ) , from the name of a nearby creek ; and <unk> proposed " <unk> City . " Ball erected a station house on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad – the sign on which would alternate between " Meridian " and " <unk> " each day . Eventually the continued development of the railroads led to an influx of railroad workers who overruled the others in the city and left " Meridian " on the station permanently . The town was officially incorporated as Meridian on February 10 , 1860 . 
 Meridian was a small village at the start of the American Civil War in 1861 . Its strategic position at the railroad junction led to the Confederate construction of several military installations to support the war . During the Battle of Meridian in 1864 , General William <unk> Sherman led troops into the city , destroying the railroads in every direction , as well as an arsenal and immense <unk> ; his forces burned much of the buildings to the ground . Sherman is reported to have said afterwards , " Meridian , with its depots , store @-@ houses , arsenal , hospitals , offices , hotels , and <unk> no longer exists . " Despite the destruction , the railroad lines in the city were rapidly repaired , back in operation 26 working days after the battle . Race relations remained tense during the Reconstruction era , with the riot of 1871 following a fire that damaged many businesses . 
 The town <unk> in the aftermath of the Civil War , and experienced its " Golden Age " from 1880 to 1910 . The railroads in the area provided for a means of transportation and an influx of industries , which caused a population boom . As the population rose , commercial activity increased in the downtown area . Between 1890 and 1930 , Meridian was the largest city in Mississippi and a leading center for manufacturing in the South . Many of the city 's historic buildings were built during and just after this era , including the Grand Opera House in 1890 , the <unk> School in 1894 , two Carnegie libraries in 1913 , and the <unk> Building , Meridian 's tallest skyscraper , in 1929 . 
 The city continued to grow thanks to a commission government 's efforts to bring in 90 new industrial plants in 1913 and a booming automobile industry in the 1920s . Even through the stock market crash of 1929 and the following Great Depression , the city continued to attract new businesses . With <unk> becoming popular in the culture during the depth of the Depression , the S. H. Kress & Co. building , built to " provide luxury to the common man , " opened in downtown Meridian , as did the Temple Theater , which was used as a movie house . The federal <unk> was built in 1933 as a <unk> project . 
 After a brief <unk> of the economy at the end of the Depression , the country entered World War II , which renewed the importance of railroads . The rails were essential to transport gasoline and scrap metal to build military vehicles , so Meridian became the region 's rail center again . This renewed prosperity continued until the 1950s , when the automobile and Interstate Highway System became more popular than passenger rails . The decline of the railroad industry caused significant job losses , resulting in a population decline as workers left for other areas . 
 During the American Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s , Meridian was home to a Council of <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) office and several other activist organizations . James <unk> and other local residents , along with Michael <unk> , his wife Rita , and Andrew Goodman , volunteers from the North , worked to create a community center , holding classes to help prepare African Americans in the area to regain the power to vote . Whites in the area resented the activism , and racial tension often resulted in violence . In June 1964 , <unk> , <unk> , and Goodman went to <unk> County , Mississippi , to meet with members of a black church that had been bombed and burned . The three disappeared that night on their way back to Meridian . Following a massive FBI investigation , their murdered bodies were found two months later , buried in an earthen dam . 
 Seven <unk> , including a deputy sheriff , were convicted in the federal <unk> in Meridian of " <unk> the victims of their civil rights " and three were acquitted in the Mississippi civil rights workers murders trial . It was the first time that a white jury had convicted " a white official in a civil rights killing . " In 2005 , the case was reopened by the state , which brought charges in the case for the first time . Edgar Ray <unk> was convicted of <unk> and sentenced to 60 years in prison . Meridian later honored <unk> by renaming a portion of 49th Avenue after him and holding an annual memorial service . 
 Starting in the 1960s and following the construction of highways that made <unk> easier , residents began to move away from downtown in favor of new housing subdivisions to the north . After strip commercial interests began to move downtown , the city worked to designate several areas as historic districts in the 1970s and 80s to preserve the architectural character of the city . The Meridian Historic <unk> and Landmarks Commission was created in 1979 , and the Meridian Main Street program was founded in 1985 . 
 Meridian Main Street organized several projects to <unk> downtown , including the construction of a new Amtrak Station in 1997 based on the design of the historic train station used during Meridian 's Golden Age ; it had been demolished . Other projects included the renovation of the <unk> Building in 2001 and <unk> 's Restaurant in 2002 , as well as support for integrated urban design . Meridian Main Street , along with The Riley Foundation , helped renovate and adapt the historic Grand Opera House in 2006 for use as the " Mississippi State University Riley Center for Education and the Performing Arts . " 
 After ownership of the Meridian Main Street was transferred to the Alliance for Downtown Meridian in late 2007 , the two organizations , along with the Meridian Downtown Association , spearheaded the downtown <unk> effort . The Alliance serves as an umbrella organization , allowing the other two organizations to use the its support staff and housing , and in turn the Alliance serves as a liaison between the organizations . Plans were underway to renovate the <unk> Building , but newly elected Mayor <unk> Barry killed the plans in early 2010 . Today , the Alliance helps to promote further development and restoration downtown ; its goal is to assist businesses such as specialty shops , restaurants , and bars because these help downtown become more active during the day and at night . The Meridian Downtown Association is primarily focused on increasing foot traffic downtown by organizing special events , and the Meridian Main Street program supports existing businesses downtown . 
 Given Meridian 's site as a railroad junction , its travelers have attracted the development of many hotels . Even before Meridian reached its " Golden Age , " several large hotels , including the Great Southern and the Grand Avenue hotels , were built before the start of the 20th century . With the growth of the railroads and the construction of the original Union Station in 1906 , many hotels were constructed for passengers and workers . The <unk> Hotel was constructed in 1905 , and the Terminal Hotel was constructed in 1910 . Hotel Meridian was constructed in 1907 , and Union Hotel was built in 1908 . Union Hotel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 , and both Hotel Meridian and Grand Avenue Hotel were listed as contributing properties to the Meridian Urban Center Historic District . 
 As the city grew , the hotels reflected ambitions of the strong economy , as evidenced by the eleven @-@ story skyscraper Lamar Hotel built in 1927 . Listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 , the Lamar Hotel was adapted for use as a county annex building . In 1988 it was listed as a Mississippi Landmark . 
 The <unk> Young Hotel was built in 1931 . A staple in the African @-@ American business district that developed west of the city 's core , the hotel was one of the only places in the city during the years of segregation where a traveling African American could find a room . 
 As the city suburbs developed in the 1960s and ' 70s , most hotels moved outside of downtown . <unk> of the Riley Center in 2006 has increased demand and a push for a new downtown hotel . The <unk> Building has been proposed for redevelopment for this purpose , but restoration efforts stalled with a change in city administrations . The <unk> Preservation Society was formed in 2013 to raise public awareness and support for the building 's renovation , featuring tours of the first floor and anniversary events .

 Papa <unk> is one of the Shetland Islands in Scotland , with a population of under twenty people , some of whom immigrated after an appeal for residents in the 1970s . Located to the west of mainland Shetland and with an area of <unk> hectares ( 3 @.@ 2 square miles ) , Papa <unk> is the eighth largest island in Shetland . <unk> of the soft volcanic rocks by the sea has created an extraordinary variety of caves , <unk> , arches , <unk> , and cliffs . The island and its surrounding seas harbour diverse populations of wildlife . The west side of the island is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and the seas around the island are a Special Area of Conservation . 
 The island has several Neolithic burial chamber sites , as well as the remains of Duke <unk> 's 13th @-@ century house dating from the Norse occupation of the island . The population reached 380 or more in the nineteenth century , when a fishing station was opened at <unk> in West <unk> . Subsequently there was a steady decline in population , although the numbers have increased from a low of 16 in the 1970s . 
 Today the main settlement on the island is <unk> , just to the east of which is <unk> <unk> from where the <unk> ferry arrives from its base at West <unk> on the Shetland <unk> . <unk> , especially sheep rearing , is the mainstay of island life . 
 Numerous <unk> have occurred around the coast , and the celebrated poem Da Sang o da Papa Men by <unk> recalls the drama of the days when Papa <unk> was a centre for deep @-@ sea fishing . 
 Papa <unk> is located at the south western end of St Magnus Bay . There are 34 kilometres ( 21 mi ) of rugged coastline which is <unk> by numerous small <unk> and four larger ' <unk> ' . <unk> <unk> ( Old Norse : ' harbour bay ' ) in the south is the most sheltered anchorage and the surrounding cliffs contain a natural rock arch . <unk> <unk> to the east ( Old Norse : ' house bay ' ) is less secluded but is the main harbour for the island and the ferry 's embarkation point . 
 The main settlement on the island today is <unk> , which <unk> <unk> <unk> and is surrounded by in @-@ bye land to the east of the hill <unk> ( which runs south from West <unk> ) . To the west the island is <unk> by a belt of glacial <unk> about one and a half kilometres in length . Much of the rest of the area consists of a shallow <unk> soil that may be derived from glacial till . There is an almost complete absence of peat on the island and due to the volcanic rocks the soils are relatively fertile . The lack of peat led to ' turf <unk> ' for fuel and the bare areas of rock in the interior . 
 The highest point on the island is in the north west at <unk> Field , which rises to 87 metres ( 285 feet ) . <unk> is possibly from the Old Norse for ' <unk> of stones ' . 
 On 21 June 2008 , Stuart Hill , the owner and only resident of the 1 hectare ( 2 @.@ 5 acres ) island of <unk> <unk> ( which he has renamed " <unk> Island " ) made a declaration of dependence , creating the Crown <unk> of <unk> . On the basis of a marriage arrangement between King Christian of Norway and King James III of Scotland that dates to <unk> , Hill argued that the island should be considered a British crown dependency , and thus not a part of the United Kingdom or of the European Union . This claim was not recognised by the United Kingdom . 
 <unk> of the soft volcanic rocks by the sea has created an extraordinary variety of caves , <unk> , arches , <unk> , cliffs , <unk> and <unk> that are amongst the finest in Britain . The ' Holl o <unk> ' is a cave that passes right through the north @-@ west tip of the island . It is nearly half a mile long and wide enough to row through . <unk> ( or Christie 's ) Hole in the south west is another spectacular cave , part of the roof of which collapsed in 1981 . Yet another is ' <unk> 's Hole ' close to <unk> <unk> in the west . This was the favourite of John Tudor who wrote of the island in his Victorian memoirs and described the cave as : 
 ... in <unk> , so exquisite is the colouring of the roof and sides and so <unk> is the water ... [ with ] <unk> or <unk> like <unk> in a church . 
 In 1953 the spectacular headland , ' Da Horn o Papa ' fell into the sea during a storm . The nearby <unk> of <unk> <unk> also has caves that can be accessed by small boats when conditions permit . 
 There is a <unk> of wild flowers , including mountain <unk> , spring <unk> and <unk> as well as the ubiquitous <unk> . The west side of the island is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and the seas around Papa <unk> are a Special Area of Conservation . The traditional Shetland Pony is still bred . 
 Human settlement of the island dates from circa 3000 BC and there are remains of several Neolithic burial chambers known as ' heel @-@ shaped <unk> ' . Little is known of the pre @-@ Celtic and Celtic eras , but when the Norse arrived it is likely they found a religious settlement as the name of the island derives from <unk> <unk> meaning " Big island of the <unk> " ( Celtic monks ) , in distinction to Papa Little some 12 kilometres ( 7 @.@ 5 mi ) to the west . 
 In addition to the <unk> colony on <unk> <unk> there may have been another at <unk> <unk> overlooking <unk> <unk> . A recent archaeological survey was inconclusive but suggests the site may be much older than the supposed 18th century colony . 
 In the 19th century the <unk> fishing station in West <unk> was opened and the island had a population of 360 people or more . However , fuel shortages and a decline in fishing due to the introduction of steam <unk> saw a fall in population from the 1870s on . At this time another duel entered the history of Papa <unk> . Edwin Lindsay , an Indian army officer and the son of the 6th Earl of <unk> , was declared insane and sent to the island in disgrace after refusing to fight in one . He spent 26 years as a prisoner before the Quaker preacher Catherine Watson arranged for his release in 1835 . Lindsay 's Well is a spring at the south of the island where he was allowed to bathe . 
 There are good examples of horizontal water mills , also known as Norse or <unk> Mills , around Dutch Loch . Originally these were two story buildings with turf roofs , built into banks to give access to the upper floor where the mill @-@ stone was sited . Inside the building there was a fixed lower <unk> , and a rotating upper <unk> driven by the water falling onto the <unk> below . Some were still in use on Papa <unk> in the early years of the 20th century , and there is still a working example of one of these mills on the Burn of <unk> , at <unk> in the south <unk> of Shetland . 
 In common with many small Scottish islands , Papa <unk> 's population peaked in the 19th century and has experienced a significant decline since then ( see e.g. <unk> ) . By 1970 the island school had closed and the population had declined to sixteen ' fairly elderly ' residents , but an advertisement in Exchange and Mart reversed the decline . A <unk> and five sheep were offered free of charge to <unk> which brought a flood of applicants . By 1981 the census recorded a population of 33 . However , by 2005 the population had fallen to 20 after serious <unk> between <unk> led to several court cases . A number of people left the island and the school closed . By early 2008 the population had dropped to just nine after a family of seven left . The 2011 census recorded a usually resident population of 15 - during the decade 2011 @-@ 11 Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4 % to 103 @,@ 702 . 
 The coasts around Papa <unk> have claimed numerous wrecks . In <unk> , <unk> <unk> alone has sunk Dutch , French , German and Norwegian ships . 
 The cargo ship SS <unk> ran aground in fog on <unk> <unk> in February 1940 . On this occasion the conditions were <unk> and only the ship and cargo were lost . In 1967 the Aberdeen trawler <unk> ran aground in <unk> Sound at the bottom of the 60 metres ( 200 feet ) cliffs . The 12 man crew were rescued by the <unk> lifeboat , the <unk> being awarded the <unk> silver medal for this rescue . 
 The Papa <unk> sword dance may be of Norse origin and bears similarities to the long sword dance of the north east of England . A description of the dance appears in The Pirate by Sir Walter Scott . 
 The writer and journalist John Sands lived on Papa <unk> and <unk> for a while during the late nineteenth century . The writer , <unk> and musician , George P. S. Peterson was brought up on Papa <unk> . 
 It is also the ' Papa ' of <unk> 's poem Da Sang o da Papa men , now adopted as part of the <unk> tradition , as set to music by <unk> Manson . The <unk> chorus chant , ' <unk> <unk> <unk> ! ' , is particularly striking . 
 " <unk> <unk> <unk> ! " refers to the <unk> ' practice of rowing their open fishing boat out to sea until the high cliffs of <unk> were no longer visible . This entailed the boat being some 96 kilometres ( 60 mi ) west of Papa <unk> . The ' tide @-@ <unk> ' are increased swells of unusual size due to the combined action of wind against tide . The <unk> final image of the piece is of the fishermen being led back home to Papa by the ' scent o <unk> ' across the water . This is an example of <unk> 's ability to create a vivid sensual impression of a situation . An extra layer of meaning is added by the knowledge that Da Horn o Papa collapsed in a storm around the time of this poem 's composition , so that it is a tribute not just to a lost way of life , but a noted geographical feature . 
 " Angel of Death " is the opening track on the American thrash metal band Slayer 's 1986 album Reign in Blood . The lyrics and music were written by Slayer guitarist , Jeff Hanneman and are based on Nazi physician <unk> <unk> , who conducted human experiments at the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II . " Angel of Death " led to the band facing accusations of Nazi <unk> and racism throughout their career . 
 Despite the controversy surrounding the song and its contribution to the delay in the release of Reign in Blood , " Angel of Death " is featured on all of Slayer 's live albums and DVDs and has appeared in several movies . The song was well received by critics ; Steve Huey of AllMusic described it as a " classic " . 
 Slayer guitarist Jeff Hanneman wrote " Angel of Death " after reading books about Nazi physician <unk> <unk> while on tour with the band : " I remember stopping <unk> where I bought two books on <unk> . I thought , ' This has gotta be some sick shit . ' So when it came time to do the record , that stuff was still in my head — that 's where the lyrics to ' Angel of Death ' came from . " 
 The lyrics detail <unk> 's surgical experiments on patients at the Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II . <unk> 's <unk> were conducted on such groups as dwarfs and twins , and included both physical and psychological examinations . Among the tests he performed that are mentioned in " Angel of Death " are experimental <unk> performed without anesthesia , transfusion of blood between twins , isolation endurance , <unk> , <unk> with lethal <unk> , sex change operations , the removal of organs and limbs , and <unk> . 
 Towards the end of the song , there is a line " Feeding off the screams of the <unk> he 's creating " , which was taken from the film The Boys from Brazil in which Dr. <unk> was the villain . 
 The lyrical content of " Angel of Death " contributed to the delay of the release of Slayer 's 1986 album Reign in Blood . The band were signed to Def Jam Records whose distributor , Columbia Records , refused to release the album due to lyrical themes and artwork concerns , deeming the artwork " too graphic " . Reign in Blood was eventually distributed by Geffen Records on October 7 , 1986 . However , due to the controversy , Reign in Blood did not appear on Geffen Records official release schedule . 
 " Angel of Death " caused outrage among survivors of the Holocaust , as well as their families and the general public . The controversy led to accusations of Nazi <unk> which have followed Slayer throughout their career . People took Hanneman 's interest in Nazi history and his collection of Nazi medals as evidence of <unk> – his most prized item being a German Knight 's Cross . Hanneman <unk> asserting : 
 " I know why people <unk> it – it 's because they get this knee – <unk> reaction to it . When they read the lyrics , there 's nothing I put in the lyrics that says necessarily he was a bad man , because to me – well , isn 't that obvious ? I shouldn 't have to tell you that . " 
 According to guitarist Kerry King : " Yeah , ' Slayer are Nazis , fascists , communists ' — all that fun shit . And of course we got the most <unk> for it in Germany . I was always like , ' Read the lyrics and tell me what 's offensive about it . Can you see it as a documentary , or do you think Slayer 's preaching fucking World War II ? ' People get this thought in their heads — especially in Europe — and you 'll never talk them out of it . " 
 The song drew accusations of racism , which the band has denied . The band members are often asked about the accusations in interviews , and have stated numerous times that they do not <unk> racism and are merely interested in the subject . 
 In 2006 , the song " <unk> " from Slayer 's 2006 album Christ Illusion drew comparison to " Angel of Death " . " <unk> " deals with the September 11 , 2001 , attacks , and tells the story from a terrorist 's perspective . <unk> Araya was expecting the subject matter to create a similar backlash to that of " Angel of Death " , although it did not <unk> , in part , he believes , due to peoples ' view that the song is " just Slayer being Slayer " . 
 " Angel of Death " is the longest track on the album Reign in Blood , spanning 4 minutes and 51 seconds , where the total duration of the album is 29 minutes . Additionally , it has one of the most conventional song structures on the album , featuring prominent verses and choruses , where most tracks on the album <unk> them . Hanneman and King deliver their ' intricate riffs ' , which offer the few hints of melody on the album according to PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand , and Araya bursts out his piercing scream , with Lombardo performing beats of 210 beats per minute . 
 When drummer Lombardo left Slayer in 1992 , the band hired a full @-@ time replacement in Forbidden drummer Paul <unk> . <unk> made one mistake out of the nine songs the band <unk> him with , on " Angel of Death " . Before the " big double bass part " there is a lead section , which <unk> could not understand , as he had to learn from live records recorded with Lombardo . <unk> could not tell how many <unk> the guitar riff goes before the bass sequence . The band members told him there were eight , " <unk> " the song afterwards . 
 Although " Angel of Death " did not enter any charts , it received strong praise from critics in reviews for Reign in Blood . Clay <unk> of <unk> Magazine noted that the song " <unk> the <unk> of any band playing fast and / or heavy today . Lyrically outlining the <unk> to come , while musically laying the <unk> for the rest of the record : fast , lean and filthy . " 
 Adrien Begrand of PopMatters remarked that " There 's no better song to kick things off than the <unk> ' Angel of Death ' , one of the most monumental songs in metal history , where guitarists Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman deliver their intricate riffs , drummer Dave Lombardo performs some of the most powerful drumming ever recorded , and bassist / vocalist Tom Araya screams and <unk> his tale of Nazi war criminal <unk> <unk> . " 
 <unk> on the publicity generated by the controversy , the band utilized Nazi imagery by adapting a logo to one similar to the eagle atop <unk> , during the Seasons in the Abyss period . Hanneman placed SS <unk> on his guitar , and wrote " SS @-@ 3 " a song about Reinhard <unk> , the second in command in the <unk> organization . 
 " Angel of Death " has appeared in several movies and TV shows including <unk> 2 : The New <unk> in a scene when the <unk> <unk> is turning into a spider , <unk> : The Movie during a car stunt , the 2005 Iraq War documentary Soundtrack to War , which details the role of music on the contemporary battlefield , and on an episode of The <unk> when <unk> asks a female escort to shoot her . 
 The half @-@ time riff was sampled by Public Enemy in their 1988 song " She Watch Channel Zero ? ! " , sampled by <unk> in their song " <unk> Hell " , which appeared in the Breaking Bad episode " Thirty @-@ Eight <unk> " , and sampled by <unk> on their 1990 single " <unk> " , and featured in the multi @-@ platform video game Tony Hawk 's Project 8 . Nolan Nelson , who selected the soundtrack for the game asserts the song is " one of the greatest heavy metal songs ever recorded . Don 't know who Slayer is ? I feel sorry for you . " 
 A compilation album of bands that have been featured in the <unk> line @-@ up , of which Slayer have <unk> multiple times , features " Angel of Death " .

 On June 16 , 2011 , a trough situated off the southern coast of Guatemala showed signs of possible tropical cyclogenesis . Though located within an area favoring development , the system remained broad and disorganized as it moved slowly west @-@ northwestward . Gradually , convection consolidated around an area of low pressure . On June 18 , a Tropical Cyclone Formation <unk> was issued for the system as it was expected to develop into a tropical depression within 24 hours . On the following day , the low further developed and was declared Tropical Depression Two @-@ E by the National Hurricane Center at 1500 UTC . Upon being declared , the depression was located about <unk> mi ( 540 km ) south @-@ southeast of <unk> <unk> , Mexico . However , after post @-@ analysis , the depression had actually developed nine hours earlier . <unk> a west @-@ northwesterly track in response to a subtropical ridge to the north , the depression was forecast to move into a favorable environment , characterized by low wind shear and sea surface temperatures up to 86 ° F ( 30 ° C ) . Three hours after classification , the depression strengthened Tropical Storm <unk> , the second named storm of the season . 
 Early on June 20 , convection increased markedly with several <unk> tops ( denoted by cloud @-@ top temperatures below − 80 ° C ( − 112 ° F ) ) appearing on satellite imagery . A notable increase in <unk> outflow also took place . As the subtropical ridge north of the storm weakened , <unk> acquired a more northerly component to its track , bringing the center of the storm closer to Mexico . <unk> bands gradually wrapped around the system throughout the day . During the afternoon hours of June 20 , a hurricane hunter aircraft found <unk> just below hurricane strength , and subsequently , the system was upgraded just a few hours later , while situated roughly 85 mi ( 140 km ) southeast of Manzanillo , Mexico . Early on June 21 , a 23 to 29 mi ( 37 to 47 km ) wide eye developed within the central dense <unk> . In light of this , the National Hurricane Center estimated <unk> to have attained winds of 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) along with a barometric pressure of 977 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 85 inHg ) ; however , it was noted that this could be conservative based on estimates of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) from the University of Wisconsin and the <unk> Analysis Branch . 
 Throughout the morning of June 21 , <unk> brushed the coast of Mexico , with the center passing roughly 15 mi ( 20 km ) south @-@ southeast of La Fortuna , Mexico . <unk> just off the coast of Mexico , the system interacted with land and began weakening . <unk> later , convection rapidly diminished as dry air became entrained in the circulation . In response to quick degradation of the system 's structure , the NHC downgraded <unk> to a tropical storm . Rapid weakening continued throughout the day and by the evening hours , the storm no longer had a defined circulation . Lacking an organized center and deep convection , the final advisory was issued on <unk> . The storm 's remnants persisted for several more hours before dissipating roughly 175 mi ( 280 km ) southwest of Cabo Corrientes , Mexico . 
 Following the classification of Tropical Depression Two @-@ E on June 19 , the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning for coastal areas between <unk> and Manzanillo . A hurricane watch was also put in place from <unk> de <unk> to Punta San <unk> . Later that day , the tropical storm warning was upgraded to a hurricane warning and the watch was extended westward to La Fortuna . As <unk> continued to strengthen , the watches and warnings were extended westward to Cabo Corrientes on June 20 . Early on June 21 , the easternmost advisories were discontinued as <unk> moved away . Later that morning , all watches and warnings were discontinued in light of <unk> 's rapid weakening . 
 In Colima and <unk> , residents were warned of heavy rains that could trigger flooding and mudslides . Schools across both states canceled classes for June 21 . In Colima , 236 shelters were opened to the public . Additionally , the Mexican Navy was placed on standby for hurricane relief . A total of 980 temporary shelters were opened in Guerrero , many of which were in Acapulco , as many residents were expected to evacuate flood @-@ prone area . An orange @-@ level alert was issued for portions of Chiapas in light of potentially heavy rains . Throughout Western and Southwestern Mexico , the <unk> <unk> <unk> ( National Weather Service ) advised that all air and sea traffic be suspended until the passage of <unk> . 
 " The <unk> Blues " is a blues song by American folk and blues musician , Lead <unk> . It was written in June 1937 in response to the discrimination and segregation that Lead <unk> faced during a visit to Washington , DC to record for Alan <unk> . It rails against racism , the Jim Crow laws , and the conditions of contemporary African Americans in the southern United States . 
 The song was recorded in December 1938 for the Library of Congress and re @-@ recorded in 1939 for commercial release . It has been remixed and covered by a number of artists including Pete Seeger , <unk> <unk> , Hans <unk> , and Billy Bragg . 
 " The <unk> Blues " is regarded as one of Lead <unk> 's best original works , but it also drew controversy . There is doubt over the song 's authorship , with some scholars <unk> that Lead <unk> was unlikely to have written a work in a genre new to him without a collaborator . <unk> have been raised over his role in the American Communist Party and whether he and the song were used to further the party 's political goals . 
 While in Washington , Lead <unk> encountered several other incidents of segregation that are believed to have contributed to the <unk> of the song . For instance , when Lead <unk> , <unk> , and their wives wanted to go out to dinner together , they discovered that it was impossible for the mixed race group to find a restaurant that would serve them . Lead <unk> was told that if he returned later without <unk> , he would be served . 
 In response to one of these incidents , a friend of Lead <unk> 's , variously identified as either <unk> or Mary Elizabeth <unk> joked that Washington was a " <unk> town . " Though Lead <unk> did not know what the word " <unk> " meant , he was fascinated by the sound of it , and after its meaning was explained to him he decided to incorporate it into a song about the trip . The song came together quickly ; one account claims that it only took a few hours for Lead <unk> to write it . <unk> liked it because it was partly based on what happened in his apartment . 
 " The <unk> Blues " is a blues @-@ style protest song that criticizes the culture of Washington , DC . It protests against both the city 's Jim Crow laws and the racism of its white population . Its structure includes several verses and a refrain that declares that the speaker is going to " spread the news all around " about the racial issues <unk> the city . The song , particularly in the refrain , <unk> race and economics by referring to <unk> as " <unk> " . 
 The first two verses speak of the segregation that Lead <unk> encountered in Washington DC : the first recounts the fact that during the trip , Lead <unk> was " turned down " wherever he tried to get served due to his race , while the second recounts the argument between <unk> and his <unk> over Lead <unk> staying in his apartment . The third verse <unk> cites " the home of the brave , the land of the Free " , juxtaposed with the mistreatment he received at the hands of white people in Washington , DC . The fourth verse speaks of the racism of the white population of the city , leading to the song 's end , which suggests that African Americans boycott buying homes in the district . 
 The song 's tone implies that the speaker feels powerless against the discrimination and racism that he encounters ; despite this , by " spreading the news " of his poor treatment in a song , the speaker uses what power he has to tell both southern African Americans and northern whites that the status <unk> is deeply flawed and that something needs to change . 
 " The <unk> Blues " follows a traditional twelve @-@ bar blues format . It is written in 44 time but <unk> to note that the song <unk> should swing at medium <unk> . The song was written in B ♭ . It uses twelve measures with verses one to four repeating , followed by the final two verses and a <unk> . 
 Lead <unk> first recorded " The <unk> Blues " in December 1938 in New York City , for donation to the Library of Congress . He re @-@ recorded the song in April 1939 for <unk> Records , for release the same year as a 78 rpm record . The version that was commercially released features Lead <unk> singing and playing the twelve @-@ string guitar without any other accompaniment . 
 The song has been covered and <unk> by a variety of artists including Pete Seeger and Hans <unk> . Seeger recorded and released both live and studio versions of the song on several of his albums . In Australia , the song was reworked as " Canberra Blues " by The <unk> <unk> , an R & B band . The lyrics speak of the problems faced by young Australians in the Australian Capital Territory in the 1960s . <unk> adapted the song to his style of European blues for the album Journey On in 1997 . 
 In 2006 , Billy Bragg reworked the song as " Bush War Blues " . Bragg 's cover is a topical protest song about the Iraq War . In one verse , Bragg claims that the Iraq War was not for democracy but instead was to " make the world safe for <unk> " . In another , he takes on the Christian right , asking where the <unk> are . Finally , Bragg <unk> the United States government for not dealing with poverty at home before going to war . 
 " The <unk> Blues " is one of Lead <unk> 's most famous songs and is remembered as his most " heartfelt protest song " . There is disagreement among music scholars as to its importance . Robert <unk> claims that the song is " peripheral " to the wider study of the blues , while Lawson points to it as a watershed in the way African Americans see themselves in the fabric of the United States . There is debate over the relationship between the song and radical politics . After its release , it became popular with left @-@ wing political groups . Lead <unk> was invited to perform at Camp Unity , the Communist Party USA 's summer retreat , and the FBI subsequently opened a file on him in the 1940s . This led to the accusations that the Communists were taking advantage of him and using him as a platform . The party claims , to the contrary , that they were some of the few people who respected him and gave him a chance to perform . 
 Jeff Todd <unk> and several other writers have suggested that Lead <unk> had significant help with its authorship and claim it is not a genuine protest song . This theory stems from the idea that Lead <unk> did not have a history of protest music before he was discovered by <unk> . Since the music that <unk> recorded was sold to <unk> sympathetic to Civil Rights , it has been suggested that <unk> helped him write a song attractive to a white audience . Lead <unk> admitted that the term " <unk> " was unfamiliar to him , and it seems out of place compared to the vocabulary of his past work . 
 " <unk> " is a song by American singer Madonna from her tenth studio album Confessions on a Dance <unk> ( 2005 ) . It was written and produced by Madonna and Stuart Price , and released as the second single from the album on February 7 , 2006 . It later appeared on Celebration , her 2009 greatest hits album . An uptempo dance song , " <unk> " was one of the first tracks developed for the album and had numerous remix treatments before the ultimate version of the track was finalized . One of the remixes was done by the Pet Shop Boys , featuring added lyrics by the band . The actual song features a dance groove tempo . It talks about personal <unk> and self @-@ <unk> . 
 " <unk> " received positive reviews from contemporary critics , who declared the track the strongest song on Confessions on a Dance <unk> . Some critics also commented on the song 's disco @-@ influenced beats while comparing it to Madonna 's older dance songs . It achieved commercial success , topping the singles charts in Italy , Spain , Romania and the United Kingdom , where it became Madonna 's twelfth number one single . Elsewhere , the song was a top ten hit . However , in the United States , the song did not perform well due to an <unk> on radio but was able to reach the top of Billboard 's dance charts and became one of the decade 's most successful dance hits . 
 The accompanying music video , directed by Madonna 's <unk> Jamie King , was a continuation from the " <unk> Up " music video . It featured Madonna and her dancers <unk> around a city in a van , dancing on roller <unk> and Madonna fighting with a group of men in a cage . She performed the song on her 2006 Confessions Tour in a similar fight sequence to that shown in the video . An additional video was created as a backdrop for a remix of the song , which depicted political leaders and scenes of war and destruction . 
 Lyrically the song has <unk> of different languages including French , Spanish , Italian , Dutch , Hebrew , Hindi , Polish and Japanese . The song talks about personal <unk> and self @-@ <unk> , denoting a shift in focus of Madonna as an artist from her previous songs about supremacy like " Everybody " ( 1982 ) , " Vogue " ( 1990 ) or " Music " ( 2000 ) which was centered around the subject of music itself . Among the various remixes , the Pet Shop Boys remix incorporated Whitney Houston 's " I Wanna Dance with Somebody ( Who Loves Me ) " with a more pronounced bassline and uses a double breakdown in the introduction . Pet Shop Boys and Madonna had always mutually admired each other , from the time they wrote the song " Heart " ( 1988 ) for Madonna but never delivered it . The remix had added lyrics sung by band member Neil Tennant which subsequently appeared on their remix album <unk> Four . Madonna 's voice hits on the first chorus which was remixed to have a masculine synth and a serious hook . A breakdown happens before the fifth minute ends , leading to the entry of programmed drum sounds after which the song ends . 
 In the United States , " <unk> " debuted at number 70 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for the issue dated March 11 , 2006 and reached a peak of 58 the following week . The same week it reached a peak of 46 on the Pop 100 chart . Its low chart performance in America was attributed to limited radio airplay . A petition was signed by about 3 @,@ 300 fans at <unk> Known as the " End the Madonna U.S. Radio <unk> " ; it was addressed to <unk> Channel Communications CEO Mark P. Mays . Message boards at Entertainment Weekly and VH1 were filled with entries by users showing support for Madonna , as well as conspiracy theories about why she was not played on radio . The song , however , reached the top of the Hot Dance Club Play chart for two weeks , as well as Hot Dance Airplay chart for five weeks . As of April 2010 , the song has sold 366 @,@ 000 digital units in the United States . 
 In the United Kingdom , it debuted at number one on the chart dated February 26 , 2006 . The song became Madonna 's 12th number one single in Britain and second consecutive single from the album to peak the British chart , after " <unk> Up .

Elsewhere in Europe , the song became a top ten hit for Madonna reaching the top ten of countries like Austria , Belgium ( Flanders and Wallonia ) , Denmark , Finland , France , Germany , Netherlands , Norway , Sweden and Switzerland while reaching the top of the charts in Italy , Spain and Billboard 's <unk> Hot 100 Singles . 
 The music video incorporated parts of the television show <unk> My Ride , and was shot by Madonna in London in January 2006 while she was making plans for her then forthcoming Confessions Tour . It was directed by Madonna 's longtime <unk> Jamie King and featured choreography from The <unk> Brothers . Many of the performers featured in Madonna 's " <unk> Up " video were in that of " <unk> " , which was shot as a continuation from the " <unk> Up " video . Madonna 's parts in the video were shot first , followed by the shot of the <unk> . The shoot took place for over two days . 
 The video starts with Madonna standing in front of neon <unk> screen in a purple <unk> <unk> " <unk> " in different languages . As the music starts she comes out from the gaming <unk> of her " <unk> Up " video with her dancers . They board a van where Madonna and her dancers strip of their clothes into new ones . Madonna wears a white <unk> with a matching <unk> <unk> with her hair in 1970s retro inspired style and pair of knee high silver platform boots . 
 As they move around the city in the van , they pick up different men from the streets to join them . These scenes are interspersed with the scenes of Madonna singing in front of the neon screen . The video progresses like this until the intermediate verse <unk> Madonna is shown standing in a cage opposite to a number of men . As the bridge builds up , Madonna starts fighting with the men . She starts <unk> backwards and tying herself in knot like positions , while doing <unk> and <unk> which defeats the men . The chorus starts again and Madonna and her dancers are shown skating in circles around a roller <unk> . The video ends with the close @-@ up of Madonna in the purple <unk> and fades into her <unk> . 
 " <unk> " was performed on the 2006 Confessions Tour as part of the <unk> themed segment . Madonna was dressed in a Jean @-@ Paul <unk> <unk> with pants and high <unk> boots . As Madonna finished the performance of the song " Isaac " , she took off the <unk> and wore a jacket given to her by the dancers and <unk> them one by one . The Pet Shop Boys music for the song 's remix start in the background . Madonna and her female dancers take to one side of a giant cage and start singing the song . As the song progresses to the intermediate verses , Madonna engages in an energetic fight with her male dancers which demonstrated her <unk> her body and putting her leg over her head and jumping from the cage on a dancer 's back . 
 The Daily Mail called the performance " energetic " . Tom Young from BBC Music called the performance a " delight " but described the video as the " <unk> " of the tour . Ed Gonzalez from Slant Magazine wrote that the performance was not among the concert 's highlights . However , he commented that the remix backdrop " feels <unk> [ ... ] a <unk> of <unk> weight you can dance too " . Thomas <unk> from <unk> described the song 's performance and remix as " fantastic " . 
 The High Five Interchange is one of the first five @-@ level stack interchanges built in Dallas , Texas . Located at the junction of the Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway ( Interstate 635 , I @-@ 635 ) and the Central Expressway ( US Highway 75 , US 75 ) , it replaces an <unk> partial cloverleaf interchange constructed in the 1960s . 
 The $ 261 million project was started in 2002 and completed in December 2005 . It was designed by the <unk> Corporation and built by <unk> Construction Corporation . 
 The interchange is considered by Popular <unk> to be one of " The World 's 18 <unk> <unk> " because of its height ( as high as a 12 @-@ story building ) , its 43 permanent bridges and other unusual design and construction features . In 2006 , the American Public Works Association named the High Five Interchange as " Public Works <unk> of the Year " . 
 The High Five Interchange , north of downtown in Dallas , Texas , is a massive five @-@ level freeway interchange . It is the junction of two major highways carrying heavy rush hour traffic , the Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway ( Interstate 635 ) and the Central Expressway ( US 75 ) , and is the first five @-@ level stack interchange to be built in the city . 
 It replaces the <unk> three @-@ level , modified cloverleaf interchange built in the 1960s that caused a severe bottleneck by narrowing US 75 down to two lanes at the junction of the two highways . The looped ramps of the cloverleaf forced motorists to slow down drastically , backing up traffic . Left @-@ hand exits contributed to the congestion . Further , its two frontage roads were not directly connected to each other , making local access difficult . 
 <unk> to the celebratory gesture , the " High Five " name refers to the five flyover ramps handling the left @-@ turn movements that tower over the landscape . The interchange is as high as a 12 @-@ story building , and includes 43 bridges spread across five levels ( the " High Five " ) , 710 support tiers , and 60 miles of additional highway . The highest ramps are 120 feet ( 37 m ) above ground . The lanes of US 75 , which are on the bottom level , are 20 feet ( 6 m ) below ground level , giving the structure a total height of 140 feet from bottom to top As part of the project , I @-@ 635 was widened to include four dedicated high @-@ occupancy vehicle lanes ( <unk> lanes ) that are barrier @-@ separated and <unk> . 
 Level II : The junction of the two six @-@ lane frontage roads , each having three through lanes in each direction , left @-@ turn lanes and <unk> , and easy access to US 75 and I @-@ 635 
 Level III : I @-@ 635 , ten regular lanes , five going each way , and four <unk> lanes ( two going each way ) separated by barriers 
 Level IV and V : Direct connection ramps ( two levels ) , eliminating the left exits of the modified cloverleaf 
 The interchange , with its decorative <unk> on <unk> concrete elements , along with the visually appealing coloration specified by the Texas Department of Transportation ( <unk> ) , can be regarded as an enormous work of public art . The High Five also incorporates a hiking and bike trail , named the <unk> Trail , which runs under all levels of the interchange . The section of the trail passing beneath the interchange was constructed as part of the High Five project by <unk> . 
 The interchange is considered by Popular <unk> as one of " The World 's 18 <unk> <unk> " , calling it a " labyrinth of lanes " and a " five @-@ level <unk> of engineering " because of its height , the number of its bridges and other unusual design and construction features . 
 The High Five Interchange project was planned as a replacement for the existing , <unk> interchange that accommodated 500 @,@ 000 vehicles daily and was located in one of the most intensely developed commercial zones in Dallas . It was a collaborative project between the <unk> , affected motorists and property owners , and the primary contractor , <unk> Construction . An essential consideration was to complete the project with as little disruption to the traffic flow as possible . 
 Reasons for upgrading the interchange , in addition to the need to increase traffic flow and reduce congestion , were to improve air quality , safety , and local access . 
 <unk> Construction Corporation submitted the lowest bid and was awarded the $ 261 million contract by <unk> , the largest ever by that agency . The construction contract for the High Five Interchange was unique in that it contained elements not found in other construction project contracts . For example , it specified the concrete maturity method to be used to ensure the concrete 's strength ( the first time <unk> had ever done so ) , and contained an early completion bonus , a <unk> scale of up to $ 11 million if the company completed the contract within four years . Also built into the construction contract was a provision that <unk> was charged for " lane rentals " by <unk> for time they closed down traffic lanes — fees based on <unk> assessments and the time of day the lane was closed . The fees ranged from $ 50 to a high of $ 110 @,@ 000 for rush hours . In order not to interfere with traffic flow during construction , the new interchange was designed largely as elevated flyover ramps and <unk> so they could be built high over the existing junction lanes ; once traffic was transferred to the new structures the old lanes could simply be closed off and removed . Little of the original interchange remained when the project was finished . 
 To save time and money , innovative construction methods were employed : The original plans called for the segments of the long ramps and spans ( used to direct @-@ connect roads ) to be made of steel , but because building with steel would interfere with heavy traffic flow during construction , cast @-@ in @-@ place segmental concrete was substituted in the plans . However , <unk> decided to use <unk> concrete segmental bridges , rather than casting the bridge elements in place , and used a unique machine , designed and constructed by Deal <unk> of Italy and costing about $ 1 million , to move the pieces into place . 
 During the construction , 2 @.@ 2 million cubic yards of <unk> was used , 350 @,@ 000 cubic yards of concrete was mixed on site , and 300 @,@ 000 square feet of retaining walls were built . Additionally , 40 @,@ 000 feet of drilled shafts and 75 @,@ 000 linear feet of drainage pipe were completed . In addition to the construction of 43 permanent bridges , six temporary bridges were built , resulting in 2 @.@ 3 million square feet of bridge deck . 
 The project was designed by the <unk> Corporation who provided professional engineering consultation throughout the construction , which had begun in 2002 and was completed in December 2005 , more than 13 months sooner than planned . 
 In 2006 , the American Public Works Association named the High Five " Public Works Project of the Year " for its massive size , its innovative design , the complexity and <unk> of its construction and the need it fulfilled for the community . <unk> as the managing agency , <unk> Construction Corporation as the primary contractor , and <unk> Corporation as the primary consultant received the award in recognition of their cooperative alliance in completing the project . 
 Tim Richmond ( June 7 , 1955 – August 13 , 1989 ) was an American race car driver from <unk> , Ohio . He competed in <unk> racing before transferring to <unk> 's Winston Cup Series ( now <unk> Cup Series ) . Richmond was one of the first drivers to change from open wheel racing to <unk> stock cars full @-@ time , which has since become an industry trend . He won the 1980 Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year award and had 13 victories during eight <unk> seasons . 
 Richmond achieved his top <unk> season in 1986 when he finished third in points . He won seven races that season , more than any other driver on the tour . When he missed the season @-@ opening <unk> 500 in February 1987 , media reported that he had pneumonia . The infection most likely resulted from his compromised immune system , which was weakened by AIDS . Despite the state of his health , Richmond competed in eight races in 1987 , winning two events and one pole position before his final race in August of that year . He attempted a comeback in 1988 before <unk> I banned him for testing positive for excessive <unk> ( over the counter ) drugs , <unk> and <unk> ; <unk> later announced they gave Tim Richmond a new test and tested negative . Tim Richmond filed a lawsuit against <unk> after <unk> insisted they wanted access to his entire medical record before they would reinstate him , after losing the lawsuit , Richmond withdrew from racing . <unk> later stated their original test was a " Bad Test . " 
 Richmond grew up in a wealthy family and lived a <unk> lifestyle , earning him the nickname " Hollywood " . In describing Richmond 's influence in racing , Charlotte Motor <unk> president <unk> Wheeler said : " We 've never had a race driver like Tim in stock car racing . He was almost a James Dean @-@ like character . " When Richmond was cast for a bit part in the 1983 movie <unk> Ace , " He fell right in with the group working on the film , " said director Hal <unk> . Cole <unk> , the main character in the movie Days of Thunder , played by Tom Cruise , was loosely based on Richmond and his interaction with Harry Hyde and Rick <unk> . 
 Richmond grew up in <unk> , Ohio . His parents , Al and Evelyn ( née Warner ) Richmond , met in the course of their work . Al was a <unk> for pipe construction companies and Evelyn was a field office manager . <unk> that highway crews had to dig up the entire highway to lay pipe , Al designed a machine to bore underneath the highway . To market this invention , he founded Richmond Manufacturing , which eventually exported machines worldwide . 
 Tim 's driving days started as a <unk> when he was given a go @-@ <unk> that he often drove inside buildings and across his lawn . He later raced the <unk> at tracks in <unk> and New <unk> . Richmond grew up in a well @-@ to @-@ do family , and was sometimes therefore treated differently by his classmates , so his parents enrolled him in Miami Military Academy in Miami , Florida . During his years in Miami , Tim and his mother moved to Florida and his father stayed in Ohio . While home in Ohio over a summer break , he met local drag <unk> Raymond <unk> through lifelong friend Fred Miller . When Richmond reached age 16 , his parents purchased him a Pontiac Trans Am , a <unk> and a Piper <unk> airplane for his birthday . Yet his mother Evelyn often worried about <unk> her only son . She once said , " Tim was lazy ... " , and " ... I did everything for him . I ruined him , I admit it . He was my whole life . " 
 Richmond excelled in sports ; he set a conference record in high hurdles and his high school football career was stellar enough that the academy retired his sports jersey after his <unk> days were over . Miami Military Academy named him <unk> of the Year in 1970 . Richmond 's other interests included flying , and he earned his private pilot license at age 16 . Following high school graduation , Richmond attended <unk> University for about one year before dropping out . 
 A friend of Richmond 's father co @-@ owned a sprint car and Richmond joined the team as a crew member for Dave Shoemaker . In 1976 , 21 @-@ year @-@ old Richmond took the car onto <unk> <unk> at <unk> , Ohio for some practice laps . " Somebody put a <unk> on me , " Richmond said . " I was running laps faster than Dave had been . It was the first time I had ever driven a race car . " Richmond and his father found a red , white and blue @-@ colored No. 98 car in Pennsylvania , which was the same number and paint scheme that Richmond used on model cars as a child . In his first competition at the track , officials placed Richmond in the slowest heat . He passed several cars before spinning out and breaking an axle . Although he made several attempts to get the car pointed in the right direction , the broken axle prevented the car from driving straight . After being towed to the pits , he parked the car for the rest of the event . Later that season , they towed the car to <unk> <unk> , only to have Richmond crash the car again . In response , Richmond 's father fired him as the driver . The next season , Al Richmond bought a <unk> better suited to his son 's driving style . In 1977 Tim Richmond became both <unk> <unk> 's Rookie of the Year and the <unk> class track champion . 
 After crashing during the first day of qualifying for the 1980 Indianapolis 500 , Richmond nevertheless obtained the 19th starting position in the race . He worked his way up to the top 10 during the race , led a lap , and finished ninth as he ran out of fuel at the end of the race . To the delight of the crowd , winner Johnny Rutherford gave him a ride back to the pits . He was named the 1980 Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year . " I <unk> up a few <unk> cars right after that , " he said . " Milwaukee , Mid @-@ Ohio . . . at Michigan I cut one in two . I was afraid my racing career would come to a halt . So when I got an offer to drive stock cars , I took it , and it turned out I liked driving them better . " 
 <unk> <unk> President Joseph <unk> III convinced Richmond to make the change to stock car racing on the <unk> circuit . Richmond made his first <unk> start two months after winning the Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year award . He debuted at the Coca @-@ Cola 500 at <unk> on July 27 , 1980 , finishing 12th in a D. K. <unk> @-@ owned <unk> . That season , he competed in five events , with two <unk> ( did not finish ) and three 12th @-@ place finishes . Overall , he finished the 1980 season 41st in points . 
 Richmond raced for three teams in 1981 . He started the season by competing in 15 events for <unk> . He had his first career top 10 finish , taking sixth place at <unk> <unk> , soon followed by a seventh @-@ place finish at Texas World <unk> . After <unk> <unk> hired him away from <unk> mid @-@ season , Richmond had top 10 finishes at <unk> and Bristol . For the final seven races of the season , he drove for Bob Rogers and had a top 10 finish at Dover International <unk> . Overall for the season , Richmond had six top 10 finishes to place 16th in season points . 
 Richmond started 1982 without a ride before getting a one @-@ race deal to drive for Billie Harvey at the <unk> track . Richmond completed 112 laps of the <unk> @-@ lap event to finish 31st , retiring from the race with engine problems . For the following event , Richmond was hired to drive <unk> Stacy 's No. 2 car . In his first race for the team , Richmond earned his first career top 5 finish when he placed fifth at Darlington <unk> . Returning to <unk> , he finished second , before winning his first race on the road course at Riverside , California the following week . Later that season , he earned his first pole position at Bristol . The tour returned to Riverside for the final race of the season where Richmond won his second race , sweeping both events at the track . Benny Parsons said that " watching Richmond go through the <unk> was unbelievable " . For the season , Richmond had twelve top 10s , two wins , and one pole to finish 26th in points . 
 In 1983 , Richmond began racing for Raymond <unk> whom he had known before he started racing . He returned to the three @-@ cornered <unk> racetrack , earning his first oval victory . During the season , he accumulated four pole positions ( Darlington , <unk> , Charlotte , and Atlanta ) , one win ( <unk> ) , and fifteen top 10s on his way to finishing tenth in season points . He made his first appearance in a <unk> Busch Series ( now Nationwide Series ) car , but did not finish any of the three races he entered that season . 
 <unk> magazine named Richmond as one of " the best of the new generation " in 1984 . That year he had one win at North <unk> <unk> and second @-@ place finishes at Dover , Darlington and Riverside . Richmond finished the 1984 season 12th in points , with 11 finishes in the top 10 and in six in the top 5 . In 1985 , the final season that Richmond competed for <unk> , his best finish was a second @-@ place run at Bristol . He ended the season 11th in points with 13 Top 10s in 28 races . In the Busch Series , he qualified at the pole position in the two races he entered , and won the Charlotte race . 
 The tour returned to <unk> a month later , and Richmond battled for another victory in a fog @-@ shortened event . In the final 8 @-@ lap sprint , Richmond competed in a three @-@ car battle with Geoff <unk> and Ricky <unk> . Richmond crossed the finish line beside <unk> , winning the race by 0 @.@ 05 seconds . He notched four more victories that season , and over a span of twelve races , Richmond earned three second @-@ place finishes , and six wins . The National <unk> Press Association named him Co @-@ Driver of the Year with <unk> after Richmond accumulated 13 top 5 finishes and 16 in the top 10 . He had a career @-@ best third @-@ place finish in points after winning seven events in 1986 , in what was his last full <unk> season . 
 Although Richmond attempted a comeback in 1988 , <unk> suspended him for testing positive for banned substances . The substances were identified as <unk> , a non @-@ <unk> over @-@ the @-@ counter allergy medication , and <unk> , an over @-@ the @-@ counter pain reliever . In April 1988 , Richmond sued <unk> over the suspension . Although he <unk> later that year and was reinstated , he could not find a car to drive . In his final public appearance in February 1988 , Richmond denied that he abused drugs and said that a mistake had been made in his drug test . His suit with <unk> was settled out @-@ of @-@ court , the terms sealed . 
 Richmond withdrew into his <unk> in Florida . There were by then rumors of HIV and AIDS , which he denied . He was later hospitalized in West Palm Beach . 
 ESPN sent a get @-@ well @-@ soon card to Richmond when it aired the July 1989 <unk> race at <unk> . The television network showed highlights of Richmond 's victory at the track from 1986 . " Tim had Hollywood good looks and the <unk> of Tom Cruise , " said his friend Dr. Jerry Punch . " There he was in victory lane with the team all around him and beauty queens hanging all over him . It was important for the people at the hospital to see Tim the way he really was , when he was healthy and handsome and vital , not the way he was as they saw him every day in the hospital . " 
 On August 13 , 1989 , Richmond died at the age of 34 , about two years after his final <unk> race . He was buried in <unk> , Ohio . 
 The secrecy surrounding the circumstance of his death caused speculation for several days . At the time , Punch stated that Richmond had been hospitalized due to a motorcycle accident , though it is unlikely that Richmond had the strength to ride a motorcycle during his last months . Ten days after his death , on August 23 , the Richmond family held a press conference to reveal that Richmond died from complications from AIDS , which he acquired from an unknown woman . Richmond 's physician , Dr. David Dodson , said : " There 's no way of knowing who that woman was . Tim was a celebrity with a lot of <unk> , a handsome guy . He naturally attracted a lot of women . " Punch later claimed that more than 90 drivers and personnel underwent HIV testing in the wake of Richmond 's death . 
 The <unk> County Sports Hall of Fame inducted Richmond in their second class in 1996 . In 1998 , <unk> named Richmond one of its 50 greatest drivers of all time . He was inducted into the International <unk> Hall of Fame in 2002 . The Mansfield <unk> Park <unk> Re / Max Series race in 2009 was named the Tim Richmond Memorial <unk> Re / Max 250 in honor of the area native . The race at Mansfield was co @-@ promoted by <unk> 's son Joseph <unk> III . 
 The documentary film Tim Richmond : To The <unk> was produced as part of ESPN 's 30 for 30 series with a premiere date of October 19 , 2010 .

 The <unk> Creek Mountains are a remote , semi @-@ arid Great Basin mountain range mostly in southeastern Oregon and partially in northern Nevada in the United States . The range 's highest point is <unk> View <unk> , 8 @,@ <unk> feet ( 2 @,@ 593 m ) above sea level , in Nevada . Disaster Peak , elevation 7 @,@ <unk> feet ( 2 @,@ 372 m ) , is another prominent summit in the Nevada portion of the mountains . 
 The mountains are characteristic of the Great Basin 's topography of mostly parallel mountain ranges alternating with flat valleys . <unk> generally north to south , the <unk> Creek Mountains consist primarily of fault blocks of basalt , which came from an ancient volcano and other <unk> , on top of older <unk> rocks . The southern end of the range , however , features many <unk> <unk> . As a whole , the faulted terrain is dominated by rolling hills and ridges cut by <unk> and canyons . 
 Most of the range is public land administered by the federal Bureau of Land Management . There is very little human development in the remote region — cattle grazing and <unk> are the primary human uses — but former mines at the <unk> <unk> produced some of the largest amounts of mercury in North America in the 20th century . Public lands in the mountains are open to recreation but are rarely visited . <unk> includes large <unk> of big sagebrush in addition to desert grasses and cottonwood and alder stands . Sage grouse and mountain <unk> are two bird species native to the range , and common mammals include <unk> and jackrabbits . 
 Despite the area 's dry climate , a few year @-@ round streams provide habitat for the rare <unk> <unk> trout . Fish populations in the <unk> Creek Mountains declined throughout much of the 20th century . In the 1980s , the effects of grazing <unk> on riparian zones and the fish led to land @-@ use conflict . The <unk> Creek Mountain Working Group was formed in 1988 to help resolve disagreements among livestock owners , environmentalists , government agencies , and other interested parties . The <unk> met and agreed on changes to land @-@ use practices , and since the early 1990s , riparian zones have begun to recover . 
 The <unk> Creek Mountains are in a very remote area of southeastern Oregon and northern Nevada , in Harney and Humboldt counties . The nearest human settlements are the <unk> Ranch , about 20 miles ( 32 km ) directly north from the middle of the mountains ; Fields , Oregon , about 23 miles ( 37 km ) to the northwest ; <unk> , Nevada , about 15 miles ( 24 km ) to the west ; and <unk> , Nevada – Oregon , about 30 miles ( 48 km ) to the east . The mountains are about 150 miles ( 240 km ) directly southwest of Boise , Idaho , and about 190 miles ( 310 km ) northeast of <unk> , Nevada . 
 The range and surrounding non @-@ mountainous areas cover an area of <unk> square miles ( 2 @,@ 100 km2 ) . The mountains run 51 miles ( 82 km ) north to south and 36 miles ( 58 km ) east to west . More of the range is in Oregon ( 78 % ) than in Nevada ( 22 % ) . The highest point in the range is <unk> View <unk> , which is 8 @,@ <unk> feet ( 2 @,@ 593 m ) above sea level and is located in Nevada about one mile south of the Oregon border . About two miles southeast of <unk> View is Disaster Peak , " a large , symmetrical <unk> that is visible throughout the region . " At 7 @,@ <unk> feet ( 2 @,@ 372 m ) , Disaster Peak anchors the southern end of the mountains in a sub @-@ range called The <unk> . 
 The Oregon Canyon Mountains border the <unk> Creek Mountains on the east along the Harney – <unk> county line ( according to the United States Geological Survey 's definitions ) , while the <unk> Mountains are the next range west of the <unk> Creek Mountains . The <unk> Creek Mountains in both Oregon and Nevada border the <unk> Creek Mountains on the southwest ; the two ranges are separated by <unk> Cabin Creek and South Fork <unk> Creek . South of the <unk> Creek Mountains is the Kings River Valley , which separates the <unk> Creek Mountains on the west from the Montana Mountains on the east . 
 The mountains lie within the Basin and Range Province or Great Basin of the Western United States , which is characterized by a series of parallel fault blocks that form long north – south mountain ranges separated by wide , high @-@ desert valleys . The <unk> Creek Mountains are <unk> and <unk> blocks with steep <unk> along the southern and eastern sides of the range . The southern area of the range , known as The <unk> , has numerous <unk> of Cretaceous age granite . These granite <unk> are commonly found in the eroded valleys below the volcanic <unk> . 
 The <unk> Creek Mountains are semi @-@ arid because they are in the eastern rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west . When moist air from the Pacific Ocean moves eastward over the Oregon and California coastal ranges and the Cascade Range , most precipitation falls in those mountains before reaching the <unk> Creek Mountains . As a result , the average annual precipitation in the <unk> Creek Mountains is only 8 to 26 inches ( 200 to 660 mm ) per year , with most areas receiving between 8 and 12 inches ( 200 and 300 mm ) annually . Much of the annual precipitation occurs between the beginning of March and the end of June . Most of the rest falls as snow during the fall and winter months . <unk> at elevations below 6 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 800 m ) usually <unk> by April ; however , at the higher elevations , snow can remain until mid @-@ June . Local flooding often occurs in the spring as the <unk> <unk> . 
 The prevailing winds are from the west @-@ southwest , and they are normally strongest in March and April . <unk> , intense thunderstorms are common between April and October . <unk> in the summer months tend to be more isolated and often produce dry lightning strikes . 
 The entire mountain range is very remote ; as a result , there are few visitors , and the range offers a wilderness @-@ like experience . <unk> , hunting , fishing , and hiking are the most popular activities . The only developed recreation site nearby is at <unk> Creek Hot Springs , just south of the <unk> Ranch , where nearby there are miles of trails designated for four @-@ wheel off @-@ road vehicles . Hunters come to the mountains seeking trophy mule deer , <unk> , <unk> , and rabbits . <unk> on some streams is sometimes permitted on a catch @-@ and @-@ release basis . The mountains are also suitable for hiking cross @-@ country or on game trails in natural corridors along canyons and creek <unk> . There are more than 100 archaeological sites in the range that document use by Northern <unk> people as long as 7 @,@ 000 years ago . 
 <unk> grazing in the <unk> Creek Mountains began in the late 19th century , and the <unk> currently <unk> grazing <unk> in the area . <unk> can be found grazing in some areas during the spring and summer months . The effects of grazing on the local environment were the subject of controversy in the 1980s . 
 By the 1970s and 1980s , a century of intense cattle grazing had reduced much of the riparian vegetation along stream banks in the <unk> Creek Mountains and elsewhere in the Great Basin . As a result , stream banks were eroding and upland vegetation was encroaching into riparian zones . <unk> populations declined as grazing cattle eliminated young trees , decreasing shade over streams and raising water temperatures . These conditions put the rare <unk> <unk> trout population at risk . Since the <unk> was officially designated as a threatened species , environmental groups began advocating the cancellation of grazing permits in the <unk> Creek Mountains . 
 Beginning in the early 1970s , the Bureau of Land Management identified damaged riparian zones and began projects to restore natural habitat in those areas . Approximately 20 @,@ 000 <unk> trees were planted along streams , small dams were put together to create more pools in the streams , and fencing was added to protect riparian zones from grazing . Next , the agency sought to reform land @-@ use plans to change grazing practices , which became a complex and controversial project . 
 As environmentalists pressed the <unk> to close much of the <unk> Creek Mountains to grazing , frustrated ranchers joined the <unk> Rebellion seeking to protect their grazing <unk> . Initially , it appeared that the issue of grazing in the range would produce prolonged litigation with appeals potentially lasting decades . However , in 1988 , interest groups representing all sides of the issue joined to form the <unk> Creek Mountain Working Group . The group 's goal was to find a solution acceptable to everyone — a plan that would protect both the land 's ecological health and ranchers ' economic needs . 
 Over the next several years , the group continued to meet and discuss options for restoring the land while meeting the economic needs of local ranchers . Meetings were all open to the public . 
 In 1991 , the Bureau of Land Management approved a new grazing <unk> management plan . It was based on the agreements made by the <unk> Creek Mountain Working Group , and it took effect in 1992 . Since then , vegetation in riparian areas of the <unk> Creek Mountains has recovered , and studies by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service have found that the <unk> <unk> trout population , still listed as threatened , is also recovering . 
 Mycena <unk> , commonly known as the clustered bonnet or the oak @-@ stump bonnet cap , is a species of mushroom in the family <unk> . The <unk> edible mushroom has a reddish @-@ brown bell @-@ shaped cap up to 4 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 8 in ) in diameter . The thin stem is up to 9 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) tall , whitish to yellow @-@ brown at the top but progressively becoming reddish @-@ brown towards the base in maturity , where they are covered by a yellowish mycelium that can be up to a third of the length of the stem . The gills are pale brown to pinkish , and the spore print is white . It is a widespread saprobic fungus , and has been found in Europe , North Africa , Asia , <unk> , and North America , where it grows in small groups or <unk> on fallen logs and stumps , especially of oak . British mycologist <unk> Corner has described two varieties of the mushroom from Borneo . <unk> species with which M. <unk> may be confused include M. galericulata and M. <unk> . 
 First described as Agaricus <unk> by Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries in 1838 , it was assigned its current name in 1872 by <unk> <unk> . Mycena galericulata var. <unk> ( named by <unk> in 1879 ) , and its <unk> Agaricus <unk> var. <unk> ( named by Fries in 1873 ) , are synonyms . 
 In a molecular study of the large <unk> ribosomal DNA sequences of mycorrhizal fungi of the <unk> <unk> <unk> , M. <unk> was found to be closely related to M. <unk> , M. <unk> , and M. <unk> . 
 The specific epithet <unk> means " bent in " . The mushroom is commonly known as the " clustered bonnet " or the " oak @-@ stump bonnet cap " . 
 The cap is light reddish @-@ brown , with a diameter typically ranging from 1 to 4 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 to 1 @.@ 8 in ) . Initially <unk> to bell @-@ shaped to convex , it <unk> during maturity , developing visible surface grooves corresponding to the gills underneath the cap . The margin of the cap has minute but distinct <unk> . The surface is moist and smooth , and <unk> . The cap frequently develops splits in the margin , or cracks in the disc ( the central part of the cap ) . The flesh of the cap is thick in the center but thin elsewhere , grayish to whitish , fragile , and with a slightly <unk> odor and taste . The gills have a <unk> attachment to the stem ( that is , running down the length of the stem ) and are a pale brownish color with <unk> of red . They are broad ( between 3 and 6 mm ) , and have a close to <unk> spacing , with about 26 – 35 gills reaching the stem . The fragile stem is 3 to 9 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 to 3 @.@ 5 in ) long by 0 @.@ 15 to 0 @.@ 4 cm ( 0 @.@ 06 to 0 @.@ 16 in ) thick and yellow to yellow @-@ brown , becoming reddish @-@ brown to orange @-@ brown in the bottom half in maturity . The lower portion of young stems is covered with white <unk> . Roughly equal in thickness at the top and bottom , the base of the stem is covered by a yellowish mycelium that can be up to a third of the length of the stem . The edibility of the mushroom is " doubtful " and consumption " best avoided " . 
 The spores are 7 – 9 by 5 – 6 @.@ 5 μm , broadly ellipsoid , smooth , and strongly amyloid ( it turns black when treated with Melzer 's reagent ) . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are four @-@ spored . The <unk> ( cystidia on the gill face ) are not differentiated . The cheilocystidia ( cystidia on the gill edge ) are embedded in the gill edge and very inconspicuous , club @-@ shaped , 26 – 36 by 5 – 10 μm , and have tips that are covered with <unk> projections that can be slender or thick . The flesh of the gills is <unk> , and pale yellowish to dirty brown when stained in iodine . The flesh of the cap has a distinct <unk> , a well @-@ differentiated <unk> ( a region of tissue immediately under the <unk> ) , and a <unk> <unk> body ( gill tissue ) ; it is pale yellowish to <unk> brownish in iodine stain . 
 Mycena <unk> bears some resemblance to M. <unk> , but is only associated with decaying hardwood logs and stumps , and is found in eastern North America , and sometimes on oak on the West Coast . In age , it develops reddish spots on the gills that are not seen in M. <unk> . M. <unk> is often confused with the edible M. galericulata , a common species that is variable in cap color , size and shape . M. galericulata typically has a <unk> conical cap that is dull gray @-@ brown , and white to grayish veins that have numerous cross @-@ veins . M. <unk> has a <unk> stem that is bluish @-@ gray . 
 Mycena <unk> is a saprobic fungus , deriving its nutrients from decomposing organic matter found in plant litter such as leaves , twigs , bark and branches . It <unk> this by producing enzymes capable of breaking down the three major biochemical components of plant cell walls found in litter : <unk> , <unk> and lignin . 
 The fruit bodies of Mycena <unk> grow in dense groups or clusters on decaying hardwood logs and stumps ( especially oak and chestnut ) during the spring and autumn . The fungus forms a white , <unk> mycelium on the surface of decomposing oak leaves . Occasionally , it can be found growing on a living tree . In eastern North America , it is abundant in the area bounded by Nova Scotia , Ontario , Manitoba , Missouri , North Carolina , and New York . It has been found in Oregon , but the species appears to be generally rare along the Pacific Coast . The range of the fungus also includes Europe , the Canary Islands , North Africa , East Siberia , Japan , <unk> , Turkey , and New Zealand . 
 In a study of the trace metal concentrations of various mushrooms species found in <unk> ( Turkey ) , M. <unk> was found to have comparatively high levels of iron ( 628 mg per kg ) and nickel ( 21 @.@ 6 mg / kg ) , measured on a dry weight basis . Laboratory studies have shown that the fungus is resistant to aluminum . The fungus has been investigated for its ability to <unk> synthetic <unk> that are used in the textile , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> industries . The <unk> are not readily biodegradable , and when discharged into the environment are persistent and many are toxic . 
 Capel <unk> ( sometimes referred to as Hen <unk> <unk> ) is a ruined chapel near <unk> <unk> in Anglesey , north Wales , dating back to the first half of the 12th century . The chapel 's original purpose is unknown , but it might have been used as a memorial chapel or in connection with a local royal court , or as a chapel of ease in a large parish with a growing population . It was used for a time until the early 18th century as a private place of worship for a nearby house , then later fell into disrepair . The walls still remain , with some traces of render on them internally , but there is no roof . 
 It contains a 16th @-@ century side chapel with a vault beneath , used as a burial chamber . It is a Grade II listed building , a national designation given to " buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them " , in particular because it is " a substantially 12th @-@ century structure " with the " unusual 16th @-@ century vaulted south chapel " . 
 The oldest parts of Capel <unk> date from the first half of the 12th century . This was a time when many churches on Anglesey in north @-@ west Wales were first built in stone following the end of Viking raids and attempts by the <unk> to gain control of the island . The reason for its construction , and the saint to whom it was dedicated , are unknown . Geraint Jones , author of a 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey , suggests that it may originally have been a memorial chapel , or connected to a royal court nearby . <unk> and <unk> , authors of a 2001 guide to ancient Anglesey monuments , note that it was built in the large parish of <unk> <unk> and was perhaps intended to serving the expanding population in medieval times . Despite this , it seems to have remained as a chapel of ease rather than become a parish church in its own right . The chapel is sometimes referred to as " Hen <unk> <unk> " ( " hen " being the Welsh word for " old " and " <unk> " meaning " chapel " ) . 
 The walls were partially rebuilt in the 14th century , and the upper parts of the walls date from this time . A chapel was added to the south side of the building in the 16th century . A vault under the south chapel was used to bury members of a local family , the Pierce <unk> . In 1999 , the vault was used to record some " atmospheres " for the album " You Have Just Been <unk> By The <unk> " by The <unk> , a collective of Welsh musicians including members of Echo and the <unk> , Super <unk> Animals and <unk> that was described by one journalist as " possibly the <unk> pop group of all time " . 
 For a time , Capel <unk> was used as a private place of worship for <unk> House , a " venerable mansion " once owned by the Lloyd family which came into the possession of William <unk> , 1st Baron Boston , in the 18th century . After the early part of the 18th century , however , the chapel became unused and began to fall into disrepair . The walls remain to gable level , with some traces of render on the inside , but the roof has gone . 
 Capel <unk> is in the Anglesey countryside near <unk> ; the parish church of St <unk> , <unk> is about 0 @.@ 78 miles ( 1 @.@ 26 km ) away . Part of the churchyard wall remains , showing that it was originally within a mainly circular enclosure , as often found with early churches . It is cared for by Cadw , the Welsh Assembly Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales , and is open to the public . 
 Capel <unk> is built from rubble masonry ; at about 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) up the walls , the style changes and smaller stones are inserted into spaces between the larger blocks , showing where the 14th @-@ century rebuilding started . The doorway is on the south side , headed by a plain arch , and dates from the 12th century . There is a stone bellcote at the west end . There is no structural division between the nave ( where the congregation would have sat ) and the chancel ( where the altar would have been located ) . There are no window openings on the north side , but there is a blocked opening to the east ( about 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) wide ) and there are the remains of a window on the south wall . There is a blocked window in the south wall of the south chapel . The vault , which is about 27 square feet ( 2 @.@ 5 m2 ) , is reached by stone steps from inside the south chapel . <unk> slabs form the roof of the vault and the floor of the chapel above . A stone in the nave , about 2 square feet ( 0 @.@ 19 m2 ) with a hole in the top , might once have been used as a churchyard cross . 
 Capel <unk> has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II listed building – the lowest of the three grades of listing , designating " buildings of special interest , which warrant every effort being made to preserve them " . It was given this status on 2 September 1952 and has been listed because it is " important as a substantially 12th @-@ century structure , with some architectural details surviving from this early period " , even though it is now in a " ruinous condition " . Cadw ( which is responsible for the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists ) also notes the " unusual 16th @-@ century vaulted south chapel " . 
 The 19th @-@ century antiquarian <unk> <unk> mentioned the church in her history of Anglesey . She said that the architecture was of " the <unk> kind , [ which ] bears testimony to its great antiquity . " She recounted that a fox had once taken shelter in the ruins , and when it was dug out , the vault was discovered , " containing several human skeletons , which <unk> into dust , when exposed to the air " . She added that further exploration of the vault then revealed " a large mass of human bones , several feet in depth " . 
 A 1990 book about abandoned churches in Wales refers to the ancient monuments in this part of Anglesey , and calls Capel <unk> a " medieval gesture of Christian power in a land so obviously <unk> with the spirit of a pagan past " . It notes that " the wheel has turned full circle and Capel <unk> today is just another ruined relic of a former age . " The authors describe the chapel as a " simple , square building " with a " small and <unk> austere south chapel " , adding that the stone slabs over the vault are " almost in imitation of the ancient burial chambers which dot the surrounding landscape . " 
 The 2011 – 12 Michigan Wolverines men 's basketball team represented the University of Michigan during the 2011 – 12 NCAA Division I men 's basketball season . The team played its home games in Ann Arbor , Michigan at <unk> Center for the <unk> consecutive year . It had a seating capacity of 12 @,@ <unk> .

Person was later granted an extra year of eligibility to return to the team . At the end of the season , three players ( Evan <unk> , Carlton <unk> and Colton Christian ) decided to leave the program . <unk> , who had started in 42 of the 69 games he played in during his first two years , left the program as the program 's fifth all @-@ time three @-@ point shooter with a percentage of 40 @.@ 5 . <unk> transferred to Maryland , <unk> transferred to Detroit and Christian transferred to Florida International . 
 Following the season , Trey Burke first said he was not inclined to enter the 2012 NBA Draft . A few days later , however , the realization that the pool of point guards in the 2012 draft was shallow and Burke 's stock was high led to some <unk> for him and his family : " When you have a season as a freshman like he did , the NBA , they like them young , " Trey 's father , <unk> Burke said . " They think their ceiling is higher when they 're young . Trey had ... a solid season for a freshman . It 's going to be one of the weaker point guard drafts in years . " Some observers thought Burke was at his peak in terms of NBA potential . Eventually , he decided to return to play for Michigan for another year . 
 The team announced in September 2010 that Glenn Robinson III , son of former first overall NBA Draft pick Glenn Robinson , verbally agreed to attend Michigan , making him the first commitment in the school 's class of 2012 . Canadian wing guard <unk> <unk> gave Michigan its second verbal commitment for the class of 2012 on March 26 , 2011 . On November 3 , Mitch <unk> , who was ranked as the number @-@ two prospect in the nation at the time , announced his verbal commitment to Michigan . Within hours of the commitment , ESPN said that Michigan 's ranked as the fifth @-@ best class in the nation . All three signed a National <unk> of Intent with the team on November 9 . After several other schools announced their commitments , the <unk> 's commitment moved Michigan from outside the top 25 to the seventh @-@ best class in the nation , according to ESPN . Michael " Spike " <unk> committed to Michigan on April 6 , 2012 . 
 In July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars . The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names . In December 2015 , the IAU announced the winning name was <unk> for this planet . The winning name was submitted by the Vega <unk> Club of Morocco and honours the 11th Century astronomer Ibn al @-@ <unk> of Muslim Spain . 
 Like the majority of known extrasolar planets , <unk> <unk> b was detected by the variations in its star 's radial velocity caused by the planet 's gravity . The variations were detected by making sensitive measurements of the <unk> shift of <unk> <unk> 's spectrum . The planet 's existence was announced in January 1997 , together with 55 <unk> b and the planet orbiting <unk> <unk> . 
 Like 51 <unk> b , the first extrasolar planet discovered around a normal star , <unk> <unk> b orbits very close to its star , closer than Mercury does to our Sun . The planet takes 4 @.@ <unk> days to complete an orbit , with a <unk> axis of 0 @.@ <unk> AU . 
 A limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect <unk> <unk> b is that only a lower limit on the mass can be found . In the case of <unk> <unk> b , this lower limit is 68 @.@ 7 % of the mass of Jupiter , though depending on the inclination of the orbit , the true mass may be much greater . However , astronomers found recently that inclination of the orbital plane is around 25 ° and the true mass may be about 1 @.@ 4 MJ . <unk> is not to be assumed ; the mutual inclination between c and d is 35 degrees . 
 Given the planet 's high mass , it is likely that <unk> <unk> b is a gas giant with no solid surface . 
 The <unk> Space Telescope measured the planet temperature , and found that the difference between the two sides of <unk> <unk> b of about 1 @,@ 400 degrees <unk> , ranging from minus 20 to 230 degrees to about 1 @,@ 400 to 1 @,@ 650 degrees <unk> . The temperature difference has led to speculation that <unk> <unk> b is <unk> locked with the same side always facing <unk> <unk> A. 
 <unk> had , on the assumption that the planet is similar to Jupiter in composition and that its environment is close to chemical equilibrium , predicted <unk> <unk> b to have reflective clouds of <unk> and iron in its upper atmosphere . The cloud deck instead absorbs the sun 's radiation ; between that and the hot , high pressure gas surrounding the mantle , exists a <unk> of cooler gas . The outer shell of dark , <unk> , hot cloud is assumed to consist of <unk> and <unk> oxides ( " <unk> planets " ) , but other compounds like <unk> cannot be ruled out yet . 
 The planet is unlikely to have large moons , since <unk> forces would either <unk> them from orbit or destroy them on short <unk> compared to the age of the system . 
 The planet ( with 51 <unk> b ) was deemed a candidate for direct imaging by <unk> . Preliminary results from <unk> studies indicate that the planet has predominately blue color , is 1 @.@ 36 times as large and 0 @.@ 74 times as massive as Jupiter , meaning that the mean density is <unk> / cm3 . It has a <unk> albedo of 0 @.@ 35 in visible light . 
 <unk> <unk> b appears to be responsible for increased <unk> activity on its parent star . Observations suggest that there is a " hot spot " on the star around 169 ° away from the sub @-@ planetary point . This may be the result of interactions between the magnetic fields of the planet and the star . The mechanism may be similar to that responsible for the activity of <unk> <unk> <unk> variable stars , or the interaction between Jupiter and its moon Io . 
 Daniel Jacob <unk> ( born 23 July 1989 ) is an English actor who rose to prominence as the title character in the Harry Potter film series . He made his acting debut at 10 years of age in BBC One 's 1999 television film David Copperfield , followed by his cinematic debut in 2001 's The <unk> of Panama . At age 11 , he was cast as Harry Potter in the first Harry Potter film , and starred in the series for 10 years until the release of the eighth and final film in 2011 . 
 <unk> began to branch out to stage acting in 2007 , starring in the London and New York productions of <unk> , and in the 2011 Broadway revival of the musical How to <unk> in Business Without Really <unk> . He starred in the 2012 horror film The Woman in Black , and played beat poet Allen Ginsberg in the 2013 independent film Kill Your <unk> . 
 He has contributed to many charities , including <unk> Hospice Care for Children , and The Trevor Project for suicide prevention among <unk> youth , which gave him its Hero Award in 2011 . 
 <unk> was born in West London , England . He is the only child of Alan George <unk> , a literary agent , and Marcia <unk> <unk> ( née Marcia <unk> Jacobson ) , a casting agent who was involved in several films for the BBC , including The Inspector <unk> Mysteries and Walk Away and I <unk> . His father , who was raised in <unk> , County Down , Northern Ireland , is from " a very working @-@ class " Protestant background . His mother is Jewish , and was born in South Africa and raised in <unk> @-@ on @-@ Sea , Essex . Her family had originally come from Poland and Russia . <unk> 's parents had both acted as children . 
 In a 2012 interview , <unk> stated : " There was never [ religious ] faith in the house . I think of myself as being Jewish and Irish , despite the fact that I 'm English . " He has stated : " We were Christmas tree Jews " , and that he is " very proud of being Jewish " . 
 <unk> first expressed a desire to act at the age of five , and in December 1999 , aged 10 , he made his acting debut in BBC One 's televised two @-@ part adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel David Copperfield , portraying the title character as a young boy . He was educated at two independent schools for boys : Sussex House School , a day school in Chelsea 's <unk> Square , and the City of London School , a day school on the North Bank of the River Thames in London 's financial district ( known as the City of London ) . <unk> school became difficult for <unk> after the release of the first Harry Potter film , with some fellow pupils becoming hostile , though he says it was people just trying to " have a crack at the kid that plays Harry Potter " rather than jealousy . 
 As his acting career began to consume his schedule , <unk> continued his education through on @-@ set tutors . He admitted he was not very good at school , considering it useless and finding the work " really difficult . " He achieved A grades in the three <unk> @-@ level exams that he took in 2006 , but decided to take a break from education and did not go to college or university . Part of his reasoning was that he already knew he wanted to act and write , and that it would be difficult to have a normal college experience . " The <unk> , they 'd love it , " he told Details magazine in 2007 . " If there were any parties going on , they 'd be tipped off as to where they were . " 
 The release of Harry Potter and the <unk> 's Stone ( released as Harry Potter and the <unk> 's Stone in the United States ) took place in 2001 . <unk> received a seven figure salary for the lead role , but asserted that the fee was " not that important " to him ; his parents chose to invest the money for him . The film was highly popular and was met with positive reviews , and critics took notice of <unk> : " <unk> is the embodiment of every reader 's imagination . It is wonderful to see a young hero who is so scholarly looking and filled with curiosity and who connects with very real emotions , from solemn intelligence and the delight of discovery to deep family longing , " wrote Bob Graham of the San Francisco Chronicle . 
 A year later <unk> starred in Harry Potter and the Chamber of <unk> , the second installment of the series . Reviewers were positive about the lead actors ' performances but had <unk> opinions on the movie as a whole . The 2004 release Harry Potter and the <unk> of <unk> was the third film in the series . <unk> 's performance was panned by New York Times journalist A. O. Scott , who wrote that Watson had to carry him with her performance . Next was Harry Potter and the <unk> of Fire in 2005 . The film was the second @-@ highest grossing Harry Potter film at that point , and <unk> singled out the humour as being a reason for the movie 's creative success . 
 For financial and <unk> reasons the last book was divided into two films , shot back to back , which drew criticism from the series ' fanbase . <unk> defended the split , stating that it would have been impossible to properly adapt the final novel into a single film . He added that the last movie was going to be extremely fast @-@ paced with a lot of action , while the first part would be far more <unk> , focusing on character development ; he added that , had they combined them , those things would not have made it to the final cut . Filming lasted for a year , concluding in June 2010 and on the last day of shooting , like most of the cast and crew , <unk> openly <unk> . 
 <unk> admitted that some people would never be able to separate him from the character , but also said he is " proud to be associated with this film series forever . " Despite positive feelings about the movies , he has no interest in doing more Harry Potter films . After <unk> hinted about writing an eighth book , <unk> was asked if he would do another film to which he replied : " [ It is ] very doubtful . I think 10 years is a long time to spend with one character . " Despite <unk> so much time to the series , <unk> has asserted that he did not miss out on a childhood like other child actors : " I ’ ve been given a much better perspective on life by doing Potter . " 
 <unk> made his film debut in The <unk> of Panama , an American 2001 film based on John le <unk> 's 1996 spy novel , and a moderate commercial success . In 2002 he made his stage debut as a celebrity guest in a West End theatre production of The Play What I <unk> , directed by Kenneth Branagh – who also appeared with him in the second Harry Potter film .

Also in 2007 , <unk> co @-@ starred with Carey <unk> in My Boy Jack , a television drama film shown on ITV on Remembrance Day . The film received mostly positive reviews , with several critics praising <unk> 's performance as an 18 @-@ year @-@ old who goes missing in action during a battle . <unk> stated , " For many people my age , the First World War is just a topic in a history book . But I 've always been fascinated by the subject and think it 's as relevant today as it ever was . " 
 His first post @-@ Harry Potter project was the 2012 horror film The Woman in Black , adapted from the 1983 novel by Susan Hill .

He has a close friendship with his Harry Potter co @-@ stars Tom <unk> and Emma Watson , and is tight @-@ knit with his family , whom he credits for keeping him grounded . 
 Sources disagree about <unk> 's personal wealth ; he was reported to have earned £ 1 million for the first Harry Potter film and around £ 15 million for the sixth . <unk> appeared on the Sunday Times Rich List in 2006 , which estimated his personal fortune to be £ 14 million , making him one of the richest young people in the UK . In March 2009 he was ranked number one on the Forbes " Most Valuable Young Stars " list , and by April The Daily Telegraph measured his net worth at £ <unk> , making him the 12th richest young person in the UK . <unk> was considered to be the richest teenager in England later that year . In February 2010 he was named the sixth highest paid Hollywood male star and placed at number five on Forbes 's December list of Hollywood 's highest @-@ grossing actors with a film revenue of US $ 780 million , mainly due to Harry Potter and the <unk> <unk> being released that year . 
 <unk> maintains a home in the West Village of Lower Manhattan in New York City . As of October 2012 , <unk> has been dating American Erin Darke , whom he met on the set of Kill Your <unk> .

 " ... Thirteen Years Later " is the fifth episode of the third season of the American crime @-@ thriller television series Millennium . It premiered on the Fox network on October 30 , 1998 . The episode was written by Michael R. Perry , and directed by Thomas J. Wright . " ... Thirteen Years Later " featured guest appearances by the members of the band Kiss , performing both as themselves and as minor characters . 
 In this episode , Federal Bureau of Investigation agents Frank Black ( Lance <unk> ) and Emma Hollis ( <unk> Scott ) investigate a series of murders on the set of a horror film — and realize that the production is based on a case Black solved several years earlier . 
 " ... Thirteen Years Later " proved a difficult episode to produce , with filming requiring a large number of shots to be completed and the script to be adjusted on short notice . It has evoked mixed responses from critics , although the guest appearances by the members of Kiss have been more universally criticized . 
 Federal Bureau of Investigation agents Frank Black ( Lance <unk> ) and Emma Hollis ( <unk> Scott ) travel to <unk> Rest , South Carolina to investigate the deaths of film director Lew Carroll ( Paul Stanley ) and Marta <unk> , the leading actress in his newest film . As the local sheriff guides Black and Hollis through the murder scene , Black realizes that the film is based on a real murder case he investigated thirteen years previously ; he is shocked to learn that the true story is being <unk> for the screen . 
 The pair interview the cast and crew as suspects , discovering that many would benefit from either of the deaths — producer Kenny <unk> had been having an affair with <unk> ; <unk> <unk> replaced Carroll as director ; Ruby Dahl and <unk> <unk> , whose roles in the film will expand without <unk> ; and Mark Bianco , a method actor <unk> the opportunity to meet Black , whose role he plays . Also questioned is Hugo Winston , the man whose partner was murdered in the earlier case and who is campaigning against what he sees as a <unk> production . 
 The production continues , and after the filming of a pool scene the crew gather in catering ; <unk> discovers a severed finger in his sandwich , recognizing from its ring that it belonged to <unk> . When the sheriff <unk> down production , Black <unk> that the killer may target the crew 's hotel ; he and Hollis arrive to find the body of the film 's publicist hanging from a rope . The next day , a film extra ( Gene Simmons ) confesses to the killings ; Black <unk> holes in his story and discovers he is not a credible perpetrator . Regardless , production is resumed — and shortly afterwards , several crew members are found with their <unk> cut , while Winston 's body hangs nearby in an apparent murder @-@ suicide . 
 Black doubts that Winston is the killer , and while Hollis stays in the hotel , he visits the production 's climactic shoot , set during a performance by the band Kiss . As he looks around him , the sheriff 's body is thrown down from the <unk> ; as the <unk> settles , Black realizes that horror films end with the leading lady being targeted — the killer is after Hollis . Racing back to her hotel , Black discover Hollis <unk> off a <unk> @-@ wielding Bianco . Black is able to subdue Bianco after Hollis <unk> the <unk> ; the actor then explains that he lacked Black 's insight and had to commit the crimes in order to see through the eyes of a killer . 
 " ... Thirteen Years Later " is the second episode of Millennium to have been written by Michael R. Perry , who had previously penned the second season episode " The <unk> " , and would provide a further three scripts in the third season . The episode was directed by Thomas J. Wright , who helmed a total of twenty @-@ six episodes across all three seasons . Wright would also go on to direct " Millennium " , the series ' crossover episode with its sister show The X @-@ Files . 
 The episode features guest appearances by the members of the band Kiss — Peter Criss , Ace <unk> , Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley — who each portray both themselves and a small cameo role . However , the band members insisted during filming that their roles be given an equal amount of dialogue , which led to Perry being asked to amend scenes on short notice and <unk> updated scripts to the shooting locations ; ultimately much of this additional material was filmed but not used in the episode . Ace <unk> was also <unk> towards his role , and requested to play a " 300 @-@ pound black man " instead , wishing to wear a fat suit like those used in the 1996 Eddie Murphy film The <unk> Professor ; he was eventually convinced that such a suit would take too long to <unk> . 
 Perry has described the production " ... Thirteen Years Later " as being " one of the most <unk> " of the series ' run , citing its abundance of stunt work and physical effects as the cause of this . Perry praised Wright for his ability to direct the episode within the usual time constraints , as he felt the number of shots involved was more akin to a feature film than a television episode . Guest star Jeff <unk> , who played killer Mark Bianco , is the husband of actress Megan Gallagher , who starred in the first two seasons of Millennium as Black 's wife Catherine . 
 " ... Thirteen Years Later " was first broadcast on the Fox network on October 30 , 1998 . The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 5 @.@ 4 during its original broadcast , meaning that 5 @.@ 4 percent of households in the United States viewed the episode . This represented approximately 5 @.@ 37 million households . 
 " ... Thirteen Years Later " received mixed reviews from critics . The A.V. Club 's Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a " B " . VanDerWerff felt that the episode 's comedic <unk> was necessary within the wider series , as he considered Millennium 's dark tone to be prone to unintentional comedy and that a comic episode provided an outlet for this . VanDerWerff found the script to be at its strongest when <unk> the character of Frank Black , but admitted that it " falls apart " when attempting to send up other subjects ; he also felt that the guest appearance by Kiss felt unnecessary and contrived . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated " ... Thirteen Years Later " one star out of five . Shearman felt that the episode had the potential to be much better , but that " the whole concept drowns in <unk> " . He considered the episode 's characters to too shallow and its commentary to be too heavy @-@ handed to fully execute anything meaningful ; criticism was also levelled at the guest roles by the members of Kiss . 
 Route 29 is a state highway in the U.S. state of New Jersey . It runs 34 @.@ 76 mi ( 55 @.@ 94 km ) from an interchange with Interstate 295 ( I @-@ 295 ) in Hamilton Township in Mercer County , where it continues as I @-@ 195 , to Route 12 ( Bridge Street / Race Street ) in Frenchtown , <unk> County . Between the southern terminus and I @-@ 95 , the route is a mix of freeway and four @-@ lane divided highway that runs along the Delaware River through <unk> . This section includes a truck @-@ restricted tunnel that was built along the river near historic houses and <unk> Cemetery . North of I @-@ 95 , Route 29 turns into a scenic and mostly two @-@ lane highway . North of the South <unk> Tunnel , it is designated the Delaware River Scenic Byway , a New Jersey Scenic Byway and National Scenic Byway , that follows the Delaware River in mostly rural sections of Mercer County and <unk> County . The obsolete Delaware & <unk> Canal usually stands between the river and the highway . Most sections of this portion of Route 29 are completely <unk> due to the tree canopy . Route 29 also has a spur , Route 129 , which connects Route 29 to U.S. Route 1 ( US 1 ) in <unk> . 
 Route 29 was initially designated in 1927 to run from downtown <unk> to Newark , following present @-@ day Route 179 and US 202 between <unk> and <unk> and US 22 between <unk> and Newark . The route between <unk> and Frenchtown was originally Route <unk> . In 1953 , Route 29 was shifted to follow the alignment of Route <unk> to avoid the <unk> with the U.S. Routes . Route 29 between South Warren Street in <unk> and I @-@ 95 in Ewing Township was upgraded to a four @-@ lane highway , with a portion of freeway , in the 1950s and 1960s . In 1995 , the southern freeway part of Route 29 between I @-@ 195 / I @-@ 295 and Route 129 in Hamilton Township was completed . This freeway section was linked to the rest of Route 29 by a tunnel completed in 2002 . A realignment of Route 29 in <unk> by the 2000s made the route concurrent with the entire length of 0 @.@ 26 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 0 @.@ 42 km ) Route 165 . 
 Route 29 begins at a modified cloverleaf interchange with Interstate 195 and Interstate 295 in Hamilton Township , and it serves as the western continuation of Interstate 195 , heading to the northwest as a six @-@ lane freeway . The route interchanges with Route 129 , a spur of Route 29 which connects to U.S. Route 1 , at a partial interchange with a northbound exit and southbound entrance . Route 29 <unk> to four lanes past this interchange and crosses into <unk> . The route comes to a southbound exit and entrance for <unk> Road . At this point , Route 29 becomes the Delaware River Scenic Byway , a state scenic <unk> that was also designated a National Scenic Byway in 2009 . Route 29 runs along the bank of the Delaware River and enters a truck @-@ restricted tunnel that passes by historic houses and <unk> Cemetery . Within this tunnel , Route 29 features a southbound exit and northbound entrance for Lalor Street . The route emerges from the tunnel as the John Fitch Parkway , passes by Arm & <unk> Park , and comes to a traffic light at Thunder Road / Cass Street where it <unk> back to six lanes . Route 29 meets South Warren Street at another traffic light . The median <unk> and it passes under the <unk> @-@ <unk> Railroad Bridge , which carries the Amtrak Northeast Corridor over the Delaware River . 
 The freeway portion of Route 29 ends at the intersection with Lee Avenue and it continues northwest along the Delaware River as a four @-@ lane divided highway . The route meets the southern terminus of County Route <unk> ( Sullivan Way ) . The median <unk> again and then <unk> as the route meets the southern terminus of Route 175 , a former alignment of Route 29 that currently serves as a frontage road . Route 29 crosses into Ewing Township and becomes the Daniel Bray Highway . It passes under the West <unk> Railroad Bridge , which carries <unk> and <unk> ’ s West <unk> Line over the Delaware River . Route 29 intersects Route 175 again and then comes to a complex interchange with Interstate 95 , with the ramps within the median of Route 29 , just to the east of the <unk> Falls Bridge . 
 Upon crossing the Delaware and <unk> Canal , Route 29 <unk> down to a two @-@ lane undivided road called River Road . It continues along the Delaware River , next to the Delaware and <unk> Canal , which runs between Route 29 and the river . The route intersects the northern terminus of Route 175 . Farther north , Route 29 enters <unk> Township and continues into a more rural setting <unk> with trees . Route 29 heads to Washington Crossing State Park , where it intersects County Route <unk> , which heads east on Washington Crossing @-@ <unk> Road , and the approach to the Washington Crossing Bridge , which continues into Pennsylvania as Pennsylvania Route <unk> . Route 29 continues north along the Delaware River through <unk> , passing by Washington Crossing State Park . 
 Route 29 crosses into West <unk> Township in <unk> County . It enters <unk> , where Route 29 becomes a four @-@ lane divided highway . At the intersection of South Main Street , Route 29 becomes concurrent with Route 165 . The route becomes an undivided highway again and meets the western terminus of County Route <unk> ( Brunswick Street ) . It meets Route 179 ( Bridge Street ) , where Route 165 ends and Route 29 turns west for a one @-@ block wrong @-@ way concurrency with the two @-@ lane , undivided Route 179 , lasting to the intersection of Main Street , where Route 29 turns north on Main Street . 
 Route 29 follows Main Street north through <unk> , crossing into Delaware Township . It comes to an interchange with U.S. Route 202 just east of the New Hope @-@ <unk> <unk> Bridge , with access to northbound U.S. Route 202 and from southbound U.S. Route 202 provided by way of <unk> Creek Road . Route 29 continues along the Delaware River and enters Stockton . The route intersects Bridge Street , which crosses the Delaware River on the Centre Bridge @-@ Stockton Bridge and continues into Pennsylvania as Pennsylvania Route 263 . Shortly after that intersection , Route 29 intersects the southern terminus of County Route 523 ( Stockton @-@ Flemington Road ) . Route 29 crosses back into Delaware Township , where it meets the southern terminus of County Route <unk> ( <unk> @-@ Stockton Road ) . 
 Route 29 makes a sharp left turn and heads west along the river as a rural road , crossing into <unk> Township , where the name of the road changes from Main Street to Daniel Bray Highway . Here , it intersects with County Route <unk> ( <unk> @-@ <unk> Road ) . The route <unk> to the north and continues along the Delaware River for several miles , crossing into Frenchtown , where the route becomes <unk> Road . Upon entering Frenchtown , an end shield for northbound Route 29 is posted to mark the end of state maintenance , which officially ends at the Washington Street intersection , where maintenance is transferred to the county . Despite this , Route 29 officially continues farther north along <unk> Road to its northern terminus at Route 12 ( Bridge Street / Race Street ) , a short distance east of Route 12 ’ s western terminus at the <unk> @-@ Frenchtown Bridge . The southern terminus of County Route <unk> is located a block north of the northern terminus of Route 29 along Route 12 . 
 Plans for a limited @-@ access route along the Route 29 corridor go back to 1932 , when a parkway was proposed along the Delaware River between <unk> and <unk> ; this proposal never materialized . Plans for a freeway were resurrected in the early 1950s to construct a road , the John Fitch Parkway , that was to run from Hamilton Township to Interstate 95 in Ewing Township . This road was built between 1954 and 1957 from South Warren Street in <unk> to present @-@ day Interstate 95 in Ewing Township . Construction of this portion John Fitch Parkway took up much of <unk> ’ s available waterfront along the Delaware River . The former alignment of Route 29 in the northern part of <unk> and in Ewing Township became Route 175 . 
 Between 1990 and 1995 , the Route 29 freeway was built between the Interstate 195 / Interstate 295 interchange and Route 129 in Hamilton Township . A two @-@ lane street , <unk> Road , connected the two freeway sections . Plans were then made to fill the gap between the two freeway sections in <unk> . Construction began in 1997 on the Route 29 freeway between Route 129 and the <unk> @-@ <unk> Railroad Bridge . The road was to include two traffic lights at Cass Street and South Warren Street and a tunnel which was to be built as a covered roadway on the bank of the Delaware River . The tunnel was originally scheduled to be complete by 2001 but was delayed after the Army Corps of Engineers discovered many environmental violations that occurred with construction of the tunnel . The roof was put in place in October 2001 and the tunnel officially opened to traffic on March 2 , 2002 . A restriction to trucks over 13 tons was put in place and made permanent in November 2002 . 
 By the 2000s , the state gave the part of Route 29 ( South Main Street ) between Route 165 and Route 179 in <unk> to the city , and Route 29 was rerouted to use all of Route 165 and one block of Route 179 . Prior to this , South Main Street had been turned one @-@ way southbound . Route 165 , which is only signed on overhead street signs , still exists , though it is fully concurrent with Route 29 . 
 The Pagan Empire <unk> and anarchy ensued . The Mongols , who probably preferred the situation , did nothing to restore order in the next ten years . In March <unk> , they accepted the voluntary submission of King <unk> of Pagan although he controlled little beyond the capital city of Pagan ( <unk> ) . But <unk> was overthrown nine months later , and the Mongols were forced to intervene , leading to their second invasion in 1300 – 01 . 
 In the 13th century , the Pagan Empire , along with the Khmer Empire , was one of the two main empires in mainland Southeast Asia . For much of its history , Pagan 's neighbor to the northeast was not China but the independent <unk> Kingdom and its predecessor <unk> , both with <unk> as their capital city . <unk> @-@ based kingdoms were a power in their own right , at times <unk> themselves with the <unk> Empire to their west and at other times with China 's Tang and Song dynasties . Indeed , <unk> 's mounted armies ventured deep into what is today Burma and may have been behind the founding of the medieval city of Pagan and the Pagan Dynasty itself . 
 The <unk> Empire first arrived at the <unk> of the Pagan Empire in <unk> by invading the <unk> Kingdom in its attempt to outflank Song China . The <unk> armies captured the capital , <unk> , on 7 January <unk> , and went on to <unk> much of the kingdom by <unk> . 
 The arrival of the Mongols did not initially upset the existing order at the <unk> as the Mongols were intent on finishing off the Song . For the next dozen years , they consolidated their hold over the newly conquered land , which not only provided them with a base from which to attack the Song from the rear but also was strategically located on the trade routes from China to Burma and India . The Mongols set up military garrisons , manned mostly by <unk> @-@ speaking Muslims from Central Asia , in 37 circuits of the former <unk> Kingdom . 
 By then , the Pagan Empire , despite outward appearances of calm , had been in long and slow decline since the early 13th century . The continuous growth of tax @-@ free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom . The crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen , inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges . Although it was able to put down the first batch of serious rebellions in <unk> – 60 in South <unk> and <unk> ( <unk> ) , the decline continued . On the eve of the <unk> invasions , between one and two @-@ thirds of Upper Burma 's <unk> land had been donated to religion . The crown 's ability to <unk> defenses was in serious jeopardy . 
 The period of calm for Pagan ended in the early <unk> . By then , the Song were on the ropes , and Emperor <unk> Khan , who officially founded the Yuan dynasty on 18 December 1271 , sought to cut off the retreat of Song refugees in all directions . In Pagan 's case , he had ordered the <unk> governor of <unk> to <unk> control of the <unk> , and in January 1271 to send a mission to Pagan to demand tribute . The tribute he demanded was nominal . Given his higher priority <unk> elsewhere , the emperor was not looking to replace the regime at Pagan . At the border , the ruler of the <unk> and <unk> regions submitted to the Mongols . 
 At Beijing , <unk> Khan , who was preparing an invasion of Japan , decided against a war with Pagan — for the time being . On 3 March <unk> , he sent a 4 @-@ member delegation led by an imperial ambassador , the First Secretary to the Board <unk> , to Pagan . The delegation carried a letter from the emperor . The letter says : 
 " If you have finally decided to fulfill your duties towards the All @-@ Highest , send one of your brothers or senior ministers , to show men that all the world is linked with Us , and enter into a perpetual alliance . This will add to your reputation , and be in your own interests ; for if it comes to war , who will be the victor ? <unk> well , O king , Our words . " 
 This time , the <unk> king received the imperial envoys but still refused to submit . ( The <unk> chronicles say that the king was so insulted that he had the envoys executed . But both <unk> <unk> evidence and Yuan records indicate that the envoys were not executed . ) At any rate , the imperial envoys did not get back to <unk> in due time . The newly formed <unk> government sent another delegation to investigate the whereabouts of the delegation , but the delegation could not reach Pagan because of an ongoing rebellion en route . 
 Meanwhile , in <unk> , the former <unk> Kingdom was officially reorganized as the Province of <unk> , with <unk> <unk> <unk> al @-@ Din Omar as governor . In May 1275 , the governor sent a report to the emperor stating that the embassy had not returned ; that the <unk> evidently had no intention of submitting ; and that war was the only way forward . 
 But the emperor rejected an outright invasion . Just coming off a disastrous Japanese campaign , the emperor was unwilling to commit the central government troops to what he considered a low priority affair . He was now focused on delivering the final blow against the Song ; the emperor ordered the <unk> provincial army to secure the <unk> in order to block the escape path of the Song refugees . He also sanctioned a limited border war if Pagan contested the takeover . As planned , the <unk> army proceeded to consolidate the <unk> in 1275 – 76 . ( Elsewhere , the main <unk> armies had captured most of the Song territory by <unk> . ) 
 What followed was a border war in <unk> – 78 . It was reported mainly in the Yuan dynasty chronicle and the <unk> of Marco Polo . Although the <unk> chronicles have no record of the border war , a <unk> <unk> inscription mentions the army 's defeat at <unk> . The <unk> accounts of the border war contain certain errors of location and numbers although the overall narrative is probably accurate . 
 The Yuan Chronicle reports that only 700 men defeated a <unk> army of 40 @,@ 000 to 50 @,@ 000 with 10 @,@ 000 horses and 800 <unk> . It also reports only one <unk> was killed , in trying to catch an elephant . According to Marco Polo , the <unk> army consisted of 12 @,@ 000 mounted <unk> , and the <unk> army numbered 60 @,@ 000 men with 2000 <unk> , " on each of which was set a tower of timber , well @-@ framed and strong , and carrying from 12 to 16 well @-@ armed fighting men . " Even then , the 40 @,@ 000 to 60 @,@ 000 figures of the <unk> army strength were likely eye estimates and may still be too high ; the Mongols may have <unk> " on the side of generosity " not to " <unk> their glory in defeating superior numbers . " 
 The country fell into chaos . In Lower Burma , the king found himself isolated , let alone plan a counterattack . Although his sons ruled the key Lower Burma ports ( <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ) , the king did not trust any of them , and he and his court settled at <unk> , west of <unk> . Without the full support of his sons , the presence of the king and his small army impressed no one . The governor of <unk> <unk> that same year . The king managed to send two small expeditions to <unk> but they both failed . Now , the entire eastern half of Lower Burma ( <unk> and <unk> ) was in open revolt . 
 In January <unk> , the embassy arrived at Beijing , and was received by the Yuan emperor . The <unk> delegation formally acknowledged <unk> <unk> of their kingdom , and agreed to pay annual tribute tied to the agricultural output of the country . ( Indeed , the tribute was no longer nominal . ) In exchange , the emperor agreed to withdraw his troops . For the emperor , the Burma campaign was the only bright spot ; his other Southeast Asian expeditions had gone badly . He did not want to invest more troops <unk> the rest of the kingdom . He preferred a vassal ruler . The <unk> embassy arrived back at <unk> in May <unk> , and reported the terms to the king . 
 But the agreement broke down a month later . In late June , the defeated king and his small retinue left their temporary capital for Pagan . But on 1 July <unk> , the king was captured en route and assassinated by his second son <unk> , the Viceroy of <unk> . Anarchy ensued . Each region in the country which had not <unk> broke away . No successor to <unk> , who could honor and enforce the terms of the treaty of Beijing , emerged . Indeed , a king would not emerge until May <unk> . 
 Given the chaos , the governor of <unk> ignored the imperial orders of evacuation . The <unk> army commanded by Prince <unk> @-@ sin <unk> , a grandson of the emperor , marched south toward Pagan . According to mainstream traditional ( British colonial era ) scholarship , the <unk> army ignored the imperial orders to evacuate ; fought its way down to Pagan with the loss of 7000 men ; occupied the city ; and sent out <unk> to receive homage , one of which reached south of <unk> . But not all colonial period scholars agreed with the assessment as none of the contemporary <unk> / Chinese records specifically mentioned the conquest of Pagan or the temporary <unk> of the conquest . 
 Recent research shows that the <unk> forces most probably never reached Pagan . They were held at bay by the <unk> defenses led by commanders <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , and probably never got closer than 160 km north of Pagan . ( An inscription dated 16 February <unk> by the three brothers claimed that they defeated the <unk> army . ) Even if the Mongols did reach Pagan , the damage they inflicted was probably minimal . At any rate , the <unk> army suffered heavy casualties , and retreated north to <unk> . They remained there as the treaty was now void . 
 The disintegration of the Pagan Empire was now complete . But the Mongols refused to fill in the power vacuum they had created . They would send no more expeditions to restore order . The emperor apparently had no interest in committing troops that would be required to <unk> the fragmented country . Indeed , his real aim all along may have been " to keep the entire region of Southeast Asia broken and fragmented . " It would be another two years until one of <unk> 's sons , <unk> , emerged as king of Pagan in May <unk> . But the new " king " controlled just a small area around the capital , and had no real army . The real power in central Burma now rested with the three commander brothers . 
 The war was one of several near simultaneous wars <unk> by the <unk> Empire and the Yuan dynasty in the late 13th century . Though it was never more than a minor frontier war to the Mongols , the war set off a series of enduring developments in Burma . The invasions <unk> in a period of political fragmentation , and the rise of Tai @-@ Shan states throughout mainland Southeast Asia . 
 The immediate result of the war was the collapse of the Pagan Empire . However , the war merely accelerated the collapse but did not cause it . Pagan 's disintegration was " in fact more prolonged and <unk> . " The kingdom had been in long gradual decline since the early 13th century . Had Pagan possessed a stronger central government , the collapse could have been temporary , and the country “ could have risen again ” . But the dynasty could not recover , and because the Mongols refused to fill the power vacuum , no viable center emerged in the immediate aftermath . As a result , several minor states fought it out for supremacy for the better part of the 14th century . It was only in the late 14th century that two relatively strong powers emerged in the <unk> basin , restoring some semblance of normalcy . The vast region surrounding the <unk> valley would continue to be made up of several small Tai @-@ Shan states well into the 16th century . 
 During the official visit by the President <unk> <unk> to <unk> in November 2013 , <unk> San Suu <unk> , the <unk> of National League for Democracy , said this was the first ever <unk> mission since the Mongols came 730 years earlier . 
 The Battle of <unk> 's Ridge , also known as the Battle of the Bloody Ridge , Battle of Raiders Ridge , and Battle of the Ridge , was a land battle of the Pacific campaign of World War II between Imperial Japanese Army and Allied ( mainly United States Marine Corps ) ground forces . It took place from 12 – 14 September 1942 , on <unk> in the Solomon Islands , and was the second of three separate major Japanese ground offensives during the <unk> Campaign . 
 In the battle , U.S. Marines , under the overall command of U.S. Major General Alexander <unk> , repulsed an attack by the Japanese 35th Infantry Brigade , under the command of Japanese Major General <unk> <unk> . The Marines were defending the <unk> perimeter that guarded Henderson Field on <unk> , which was captured from the Japanese by the Allies in landings on <unk> on 7 August 1942 . <unk> 's unit was sent to <unk> in response to the Allied landings with the mission of <unk> the airfield and driving the Allied forces from the island . 
 <unk> the strength of Allied forces on <unk> – about 12 @,@ 000 – <unk> 's 6 @,@ 000 soldiers conducted several nighttime frontal assaults on the U.S. defenses . The main Japanese assault occurred around <unk> ridge south of Henderson Field , manned by troops from several U.S. Marine Corps units , primarily troops from the 1st <unk> and 1st Parachute Battalions under U.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Merritt A. <unk> . Although the Marine defenses were almost overrun , <unk> 's attack was ultimately defeated , with heavy losses for the Japanese . 
 Because of the key participation by <unk> 's unit in defending the ridge , the ridge was commonly referred to as " <unk> 's " ridge in historical accounts of the battle in Western sources . After <unk> 's Ridge , the Japanese continued to send troops to <unk> for further attempts to retake Henderson Field , affecting Japanese offensive operations in other areas of the South Pacific . 
 On 7 August 1942 , Allied forces ( primarily U.S. ) landed on <unk> , <unk> , and Florida Islands in the Solomon Islands . The landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the Japanese as bases for threatening the supply routes between the U.S. and Australia . They were also intended to secure the islands as starting points for a campaign to neutralize the major Japanese base at Rabaul and support the Allied New Guinea campaign . The landings initiated the six @-@ month @-@ long <unk> campaign . 
 Taking the Japanese by surprise , by nightfall on 8 August the Allied landing forces had secured <unk> and nearby small islands , as well as an airfield under construction at <unk> Point ( 9 ° 25 ′ 45 ″ S 160 ° 3 ′ 4 ″ E ) on the north shore of the island of <unk> east of the present day capital of <unk> . <unk> placed his 11 @,@ 000 troops of the 1st Marine Division on <unk> in a loose perimeter around the <unk> Point area . 
 On 12 August , the airfield was named Henderson Field after Major <unk> Henderson , a Marine <unk> who had been killed at the Battle of Midway . The Allied aircraft and pilots that subsequently operated out of Henderson Field were called the " <unk> Air Force " after the Allied code name for <unk> . 
 In <unk> , <unk> 's troops discovered the supply base for <unk> 's forces , including large <unk> of food , ammunition and medical supplies , and a <unk> radio . The Marines seized documents , equipment and food supplies , destroyed the rest , and returned to the <unk> perimeter at 17 : 30 . The quantities of supplies and intelligence from the captured documents revealed that at least 3 @,@ 000 Japanese troops were on the island and apparently planning an attack . 
 During the day of 12 September , <unk> 's troops struggled through the jungle toward their assembly points for that night 's attacks . <unk> wanted his three Center Body battalions in place by 14 : 00 , but they did not reach their assembly areas until after 22 : 00 . <unk> was also delayed in his advance towards the Marine lines in the west . Only the <unk> battalion reported that they were in place on time . Despite the problems in reaching the planned attack positions , <unk> was still confident in his attack plan because a captured U.S. pilot disclosed that the ridge was the weakest part of the Marine defenses . Japanese bombers attacked the ridge during daytime on 11 – 12 September , causing a few casualties , including two killed . 
 The Americans knew of the approach of the Japanese forces from reports from native scouts and their own patrols , but did not know exactly where or when they would attack . The ridge around which <unk> deployed his men consisted of three distinct <unk> . At the southern tip and surrounded on three sides by thick jungle was Hill 80 ( so named because it rose 80 ft ( 24 m ) above sea level ) . Six hundred yards north was Hill 123 ( 123 ft ( 37 m ) high ) , the dominant feature on the ridge . The <unk> <unk> was unnamed and about 60 ft ( 18 m ) high . <unk> placed the five companies from the <unk> battalion on the west side of the ridge and the three Parachute battalion companies on the east side , holding positions in depth from Hill 80 back to Hill 123 . Two of the five <unk> companies , " B " and " C " , held a line between the ridge , a small , swampy <unk> , and the <unk> River . Machine @-@ gun teams from " E " Company , the heavy weapons company , were scattered throughout the defenses . <unk> placed his command post on Hill 123 . 
 At first light on 13 September , <unk> Air Force aircraft and Marine artillery fired into the area just south of the ridge , forcing any Japanese out in the open to seek cover in the nearby jungle . The Japanese suffered several casualties , including two officers from <unk> 's battalion . At 05 : 50 , <unk> decided to regroup his forces for another attack that night . 
 Late in the afternoon , <unk> stepped onto a grenade box and addressed his exhausted troops , saying , 
 You men have done a great job , and I have just one more thing to ask of you . <unk> out just one more night . I know we 've been without sleep a long time . But we expect another attack from them tonight and they may come through here . I have every reason to believe that we will have reliefs here for all of us in the morning . 
 <unk> 's speech " raised the spirits " of the Raiders and helped them prepare mentally for the night ahead . 
 Meanwhile , <unk> 's 2nd Battalion , under Major <unk> Tamura , assembled for their planned assault against Hill 80 from the jungle south of the ridge . Marine observers spotted Tamura 's preparations and called in artillery fire . At about 22 : 00 , a barrage from twelve 105 mm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) guns hit Tamura 's position . In response , two companies of Tamura 's troops — numbering about 320 men — charged up Hill 80 with fixed bayonets behind their own barrage of mortar fire and grenades . Tamura 's attack hit Company B of the Marine Parachute battalion and also <unk> Company B , pushing the <unk> off the east side of the ridge into a draw below the <unk> . To protect the exposed <unk> Company B , <unk> immediately ordered them to pull back onto Hill 123 . 
 At the same time , a Japanese company from <unk> 's battalion infiltrated through a gap between the east side of the ridge and Parachute Company C. <unk> that their positions were now <unk> , Parachute Companies B and C climbed onto the ridge and retreated to a position behind Hill 123 . In the darkness and confusion of the battle , the retreat quickly became confused and disorganized . A few Marines began <unk> that the Japanese were attacking with poison gas , <unk> other Marines who no longer possessed their gas masks . After arriving behind Hill 123 , some of the Marines continued on towards the airfield , repeating the word " withdraw " to anyone within <unk> . Other Marines began to follow them . Just at the moment that it appeared that the Marines on the hill were about to break and head for the rear in a <unk> , <unk> , Major Kenneth D. Bailey from <unk> 's staff , and other Marine officers appeared and , with " vivid " language , <unk> the Marines back into defensive positions around Hill 123 . 
 The Japanese hit <unk> 's left flank just after the <unk> took position but were again stopped by Marine rifle , machine @-@ gun , mortar , and grenade fire . Marine 105 mm and 75 mm artillery was also taking a heavy toll on the attacking Japanese . A captured Japanese soldier later said that his unit was " annihilated " by the Marine artillery fire , which only 10 % of his company survived . 
 By 04 : 00 , after <unk> several more assaults , some of which resulted in hand @-@ to @-@ hand fighting , and severe sniper fire from all sides , <unk> 's men were joined by troops from the 2nd Battalion , 5th Marine Regiment , who helped repulse two more Japanese attacks before dawn . Throughout the night , as <unk> 's men came close to overrunning the Marine defenses , <unk> remained standing about 20 yd ( 18 m ) behind the Marine firing line on Hill 123 , <unk> his troops and directing their defensive efforts . Said Marine Captain <unk> Smith , who was in position to observe <unk> for most of the night , " I can say that if there is such a thing as one man holding a battalion together , <unk> did it that night . He stood just behind the front lines – stood , when most of us <unk> the ground . " 
 During the heavy fighting , portions of three Japanese companies , including two from Tamura 's and one from <unk> 's battalions , <unk> the Marine defenses on the ridge , while suffering heavy losses from Marine gunfire , and reached the edge of " Fighter One " , a secondary runway of Henderson Field . A counterattack by the Marine engineers stopped one Japanese company 's advances and forced it to retreat . The other two companies waited at the edge of the jungle for reinforcements to arrive before attacking into the open area around the airfield . When no reinforcements joined them , both companies went back to their original positions south of the ridge after <unk> . Most of the rest of <unk> 's battalion did not participate in the battle because they lost contact with their commander during the night . 
 As the sun rose on 14 September , pockets of Japanese soldiers remained scattered along both sides of the ridge . But with Tamura 's battalion shattered after losing <unk> of its officers and men , and with heavy casualties to his other attacking units as well , <unk> 's assault on the ridge had effectively ended . About 100 Japanese soldiers still remained in the open on the south slope of Hill 80 , perhaps preparing for one more charge on Hill 123 . At first light , three U.S. Army aircraft from the 67th Fighter Squadron at Henderson Field , acting on a request personally delivered by Bailey , <unk> the Japanese near Hill 80 and killed most of them , with the few survivors retreating back into the jungle . 
 At 23 : 00 on 14 September , the remnants of the <unk> battalion conducted another attack on the same portion of the Marine lines , but were repulsed . A final " weak " attack by the <unk> unit on the evening of 15 September was also defeated . 
 <unk> 's unit of about 650 men attacked the Marines at several locations on the west side of the <unk> perimeter . At about 04 : 00 on 14 September , two Japanese companies attacked positions held by the 3rd Battalion , 5th Marine Regiment ( 3 / 5 ) near the coast and were thrown back with heavy losses . Another Japanese company captured a small ridge somewhat inland but was then pinned down by Marine artillery fire throughout the day and took heavy losses before withdrawing on the evening of 14 September . The rest of <unk> 's unit failed to find the Marine lines and did not participate in the attack . 
 In total , <unk> 's forces lost about 830 killed in the attack , including 350 in Tamura 's battalion , 200 in <unk> 's battalion , 120 in <unk> 's force , 100 in the <unk> battalion , and 60 in <unk> 's battalion . An unknown number of wounded also died during the withdrawal march to the <unk> . On and around the ridge , the Marines counted 500 Japanese dead , including 200 on the slopes of Hill 123 . The Marines suffered 80 killed between 12 and 14 September . 
 On 17 September , <unk> sent two companies from the 1st Battalion , 1st Marine Regiment ( 1 / 1 ) to pursue the retreating Japanese . The Marines were ambushed by two Japanese companies acting as rear @-@ guards for the withdrawal , and one Marine platoon was pinned down as the rest of the Marines retreated . The Marine company commander requested permission to attempt to rescue his platoon but was denied by <unk> . By nightfall , the Japanese overran and nearly annihilated the platoon , killing 24 Marines with only a few wounded members of the platoon surviving . On 20 September , a patrol from <unk> 's Raiders encountered stragglers from <unk> 's retreating column and called in artillery fire that killed 19 of them . 
 As the Japanese regrouped west of the <unk> , the U.S. forces concentrated on shoring up and strengthening their <unk> defenses . On 14 September , <unk> moved another battalion , the 3rd Battalion , 2nd Marine Regiment ( 3 / 2 ) , from <unk> to <unk> . On 18 September , an Allied naval convoy delivered 4 @,@ 157 men from the 3rd Provisional Marine Brigade ( the U.S. 7th Marine Regiment augmented by additional support units ) to <unk> . These reinforcements allowed <unk> — beginning on 19 September — to establish an unbroken line of defense around the <unk> perimeter . <unk> 's forces ' next significant clashes with the Japanese occurred along the <unk> River from 23 – 27 September and 6 – 9 October . 
 After delivering more forces during the next month the Japanese mounted a major ground offensive on <unk> , led by <unk> , in late October 1942 at the Battle for Henderson Field , but it resulted in an even more decisive defeat for the Japanese . <unk> later stated that <unk> 's assault on the ridge in September was the only time during the entire campaign he had doubts about the outcome and that had it succeeded , " we would have been in a pretty bad condition . " Historian Richard B. Frank adds , " The Japanese never came closer to victory on the island itself than in September 1942 , on a ridge <unk> up from the jungle just south of the critical airfield , best known ever after as Bloody Ridge . " 
 Route 50 is a state highway in the southern part of the U.S. state of New Jersey . It runs 26 @.@ 02 mi ( 41 @.@ 88 km ) from an intersection with U.S. Route 9 ( US 9 ) and the Garden State Parkway in Upper Township , Cape May County to an intersection with US 30 and County Route <unk> ( CR <unk> ) in <unk> Harbor City , Atlantic County . The route , which is mostly a two @-@ lane undivided road , passes through mostly rural areas of Atlantic and Cape May counties as well as the communities of <unk> , <unk> City , <unk> Manor , and Mays Landing . <unk> 50 intersects several roads , including Route 49 in <unk> , US 40 in Mays Landing , and US 322 and the Atlantic City Expressway in Hamilton Township . 
 The portion of current Route 50 between <unk> and Petersburg received funding in 1910 to become a spur of the Ocean Highway . In 1917 , what is now Route 50 was designated a part of pre @-@ 1927 Route 14 , a route that was to run from Cape May to <unk> Harbor City . Route 50 was designated onto its current alignment in 1927 , replacing this portion of pre @-@ 1927 Route 14 . In 1960 , a freeway was proposed for Route 50 , running from the Garden State Parkway in Dennis Township to US 30 in <unk> Township . This proposal was canceled by the mid @-@ 1970s due to financial and environmental concerns as well as lack of traffic . The interchange between Route 50 and the Atlantic City Expressway was reconstructed into a full interchange , with completion in June 2010 . 
 After passing some homes and Stephen Lake , the road turns to the north and passes to the west of <unk> Manor County Park . The route crosses the South River into <unk> Township , passing the residential community of <unk> to the east and meeting CR <unk> . It soon enters Hamilton Township , where the name of the road becomes Mill Street and it comes to a junction with US 40 ( Harding Highway ) . CR <unk> Truck heads to the west on US 40 at this point while Route 50 heads east on US 40 , and CR <unk> continues north . 
 US 40 and <unk> 50 follow the Harding Highway , a two @-@ lane undivided road , turning to the northeast and crossing the Great <unk> Harbor River . Upon passing over the river , enters Mays Landing and turns north , encountering CR <unk> before passing over an abandoned railroad line and heading into the downtown area of Mays Landing . Here , the road crosses CR <unk> , and US 40 splits from <unk> 50 by turning east along that road . Meanwhile , Route 50 continues north on Cape May Avenue , passing through developed areas . It leaves Mays Landing and heads into back into forests . The route turns to the northeast , passing near the <unk> Leaf Lakes residential development , before coming to an interchange with US 322 ( Black Horse Pike ) . 
 Past this interchange , Route 50 <unk> to a four @-@ lane divided highway and reaches a full interchange with the Atlantic City Expressway . The route becomes a two @-@ lane undivided road again and continues through inhabited areas , crossing into Galloway Township , where there is an intersection with CR <unk> . A short distance later , the road crosses New Jersey Transit ’ s Atlantic City Line near the <unk> Harbor City Station and enters <unk> Harbor City , turning into Philadelphia Avenue . A block after the railroad crossing , Route 50 ends at an intersection with US 30 and CR <unk> ( White Horse Pike ) , with CR <unk> continuing north on Philadelphia Avenue at this point . 
 Route 50 is an important route linking the Atlantic City Expressway with the Jersey Shore resorts in Cape May County , serving as an alternate to more <unk> routes . It also serves as evacuation route from Cape May County to inland areas in the event of a hurricane . 
 The portion of current Route 50 between <unk> and Petersburg received funding to become a spur of the Ocean Highway in 1910 . The modern @-@ day alignment of Route 50 was legislated as part of pre @-@ 1927 Route 14 in 1917 , a route that was to run from Cape May to <unk> Harbor City . In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering , the portion of pre @-@ 1927 Route 14 between <unk> and <unk> Harbor City was designated as Route 50 , the highest state route number assigned in the renumbering . Route 50 retained its current routing in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering . A freeway was proposed for Route 50 around 1960 , running from the Garden State Parkway in Dennis Township north to US 30 in <unk> Township . This proposed freeway was intended to provide economic development to the region as well as provide a better route to the Jersey Shore resorts of Cape May County for travelers from the Delaware Valley . However , this freeway was canceled by the mid @-@ 1970s due to financial and environmental concerns as well as lack of traffic along Route 50 . On November 21 , 2008 , construction began on making the interchange with the Atlantic City Expressway a full interchange as part of a series of improvements set for the Atlantic City Expressway . This project was completed on June 18 , 2010 . 
 Air Rhodesia Flight <unk> was a scheduled passenger flight that was shot down by the Zimbabwe People 's Revolutionary Army ( <unk> ) on 3 September 1978 , during the Rhodesian Bush War . The aircraft involved , a Vickers Viscount named the <unk> , was flying the last leg of Air Rhodesia 's regular scheduled service from Victoria Falls to the capital Salisbury , via the resort town of <unk> . 
 Soon after Flight <unk> took off , a group of <unk> guerrillas scored a direct hit on its starboard wing with a Soviet @-@ made <unk> 2 surface @-@ to @-@ air infrared <unk> missile , critically damaging the aircraft and forcing an emergency landing . An attempted belly landing in a cotton field just west of <unk> was <unk> by an unseen ditch , which caused the plane to cartwheel and break up . Of the 52 passengers and four crew , 38 died in this crash ; the insurgents then approached the wreckage , rounded up the 10 survivors they could see and massacred them with automatic gunfire . Three passengers survived by hiding in the surrounding bush , while a further five lived because they had gone to look for water before the guerrillas arrived . 
 <unk> leader Joshua <unk> publicly claimed responsibility for shooting down the <unk> in an interview with the BBC 's Today programme the same evening , saying the aircraft had been used for military purposes , but denied that his men had killed survivors on the ground . The majority of <unk> , both black and white , saw the attack as an act of terrorism . A fierce white Rhodesian backlash followed against perceived enemies , with many whites becoming <unk> <unk> and suspicious of blacks in general , even though few black <unk> supported attacks of this kind . Reports viewing the attack negatively appeared in international journals such as Time magazine , but there was almost no acknowledgement of it by overseas governments , much to the Rhodesian government 's <unk> . 
 <unk> between <unk> and Prime Minister Ian Smith , which had been progressing <unk> , were immediately suspended by the furious <unk> , with Smith calling <unk> a " monster " . On 10 September , Smith announced the extension of martial law over selected areas . The Rhodesian Security Forces launched several retaliatory strikes into Zambia and Mozambique over the following months , attacking both <unk> and its rival , the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army ( ZANLA ) . The attack on <unk> in particular brought great controversy as many of those killed were refugees camping in and around guerrilla positions . Five months later , in February 1979 , <unk> shot down Air Rhodesia Flight <unk> , another civilian flight , in an almost identical incident . 
 A dispute over the terms for the granting of full sovereignty to the self @-@ governing colony of Rhodesia ( or Southern Rhodesia ) led the colonial government , headed by Prime Minister Ian Smith , to <unk> declare independence from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965 . The idea of " no independence before majority rule " had recently gained ground in Britain and elsewhere amid decolonisation , and Rhodesia 's government was dominated by the country 's white minority , so the unilateral declaration went <unk> internationally . Britain and the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Rhodesia . 
 After the security forces mounted a successful counter @-@ insurgency campaign during 1973 and 1974 , developments overseas caused the conflict 's momentum to shift in the insurgents ' favour . The leftist Carnation Revolution of April 1974 caused Portugal to withdraw its key economic support for Smith 's administration , and led to Mozambique 's independence the following year as a communist state openly allied with <unk> . Around the same time , Rhodesia 's other main <unk> , South Africa , adopted a <unk> initiative that forced a ceasefire , giving the guerrillas time to regroup . Following the abortive Victoria Falls Conference of August 1975 , Smith and the <unk> leader Joshua <unk> held unsuccessful talks between December 1975 and March 1976 . <unk> and <unk> announced in October 1976 , during the run @-@ up to the unsuccessful Geneva Conference in December , that they would <unk> attend conferences as a joint " Patriotic Front " . 
 Rhodesian air traffic was not seriously threatened until about 1977 , in the latter stages of the war ; before this time , neither revolutionary force had the weapons to launch a viable attack against an aerial target . The weapon that made such attacks feasible for <unk> was the <unk> 2 shoulder @-@ launched surface @-@ to @-@ air missile launcher , supplied by the Soviet Union from the mid @-@ 1970s as part of the Warsaw Pact 's materiel support . By September 1978 , there had been 20 reported attempts to shoot down Rhodesian military aircraft using these weapons , none of which had been successful . Some Rhodesian Air Force Dakotas had been hit , but all had survived and landed safely . No civilian aircraft had yet been targeted during the Bush War . 
 Air Rhodesia was the country 's national airline , established by the government on 1 September 1967 to succeed Central African Airways , which was dissolved at the end of that year . Based at Salisbury Airport , Air Rhodesia 's flight network during the late 1970s comprised a domestic programme of passenger and cargo flights , as well as international services to the South African cities of Johannesburg and Durban . 
 The Flight <unk> aircraft was a Vickers Viscount <unk> , a British @-@ made turboprop aircraft with two engines on each wing . It was named the <unk> after the river of the same name , which flowed between Lake <unk> and the Rhodesian capital Salisbury . 
 The <unk> was on the second and final leg of its regular scheduled journey between Victoria Falls and Salisbury , stopping over in the resort town of <unk> . Despite the occasional rocket and mortar attacks launched on <unk> by <unk> guerrillas on the northern side of the <unk> ( in Zambia ) , the resort had endured as one of Rhodesia 's choice tourist destinations . The flight on 3 September 1978 , Sunday afternoon , from <unk> to Salisbury carried four crew members and 52 passengers , most of whom were <unk> from Salisbury , returning home after a weekend at the lake . The flight took off from <unk> Airport on schedule soon after 17 : 00 Central Africa Time . 
 Flight <unk> was <unk> by 36 @-@ year @-@ old Captain John Hood , a native of <unk> who had gained his commercial pilot licence in 1966 . He had flown <unk> for Air Rhodesia since 1968 , and had also served in the Rhodesian Air Force on a voluntary basis . His first officer , Garth Beaumont , was 31 years old , and had lived in Rhodesia for most of his life , having immigrated as a child from South Africa . The two air <unk> were <unk> <unk> , 21 years old and from <unk> , and 23 @-@ year @-@ old Louise Pearson , from Salisbury . 
 A group of <unk> guerrillas , armed with a <unk> @-@ 2 launcher , waited in the bush beneath Flight <unk> 's <unk> , and fired on the <unk> about five minutes after it took off , while the aircraft was still in the climb phase of its flight . The heat @-@ seeking missile hit the plane 's starboard wing and exploded , causing the inner engine to also explode . A fuel tank and hydraulic lines <unk> , creating a fire that the passengers and crew could not put out . The second starboard engine failed almost immediately , leaving Hood with only his two port engines . <unk> wildly , the <unk> began to descend rapidly . 
 At 17 : 10 Captain Hood sent a distress call to air traffic control , informing them that he had lost the two starboard engines and was going to crash . " We 're going in , " he <unk> . <unk> his passengers to <unk> for an emergency landing , he aimed for an open field of cotton in the <unk> Hills , in the bush to the west of <unk> , intending to belly land the craft . The landing was relatively stable until the <unk> hit a previously unseen ditch , <unk> and exploded . The remaining fuel tanks <unk> and caught fire , setting the wrecked cabin <unk> . 
 Of the 56 people on board , 38 , including Hood and Beaumont , died in the crash . Eighteen survived , albeit with injuries , and climbed out of the wreckage . After briefly settling the others , one of the passengers , Dr Cecil <unk> , led four others — young <unk> Robert and Shannon <unk> , Mrs Sharon <unk> , and her four @-@ year @-@ old daughter Tracey — off in the direction of a nearby village in search of water . The other 13 remained close to the wreckage . Meanwhile , nine guerrillas made their way towards the crash site , and reached it at about 17 : 45 . Three of the 13 survivors remaining at the crash site hid on seeing figures approaching : Rhodesian Army <unk> Anthony Hill , 39 , took cover in the surrounding bush , while businessman Hans Hansen and his wife Diana did the same . This left 10 passengers in full view near the wreckage , including four women and two girls ( aged 11 and 4 ) . 
 The guerrillas , who were armed with AK @-@ 47 rifles , presented themselves to the 10 passengers as friendly , saying they would summon help and bring water . They spoke in English , both to the survivors and among themselves . They told the passengers to <unk> around a point a few metres from the wreckage ; when the survivors said that some of them were too badly injured to walk , the insurgents told the able @-@ bodied men to carry the others . The passengers were assembled into an area of about 10 square metres ( 110 sq ft ) . Standing roughly 15 metres ( 49 ft ) away , the cadres now raised their weapons . " You have taken our land , " one of them said . " Please don 't shoot us ! " one of the passengers cried , just before they were killed by a sustained burst of automatic gunfire . 
 Having collected water from the nearby village , <unk> and his companions were almost back at the crash site when they heard the shots . <unk> it was personal ammunition in the luggage exploding in the heat , they continued on their way , and called out to the other passengers , who they thought were still alive . This alerted the insurgents to the presence of more survivors ; one of the guerrillas told <unk> 's group to " come here " . The insurgents then opened fire on their general location , prompting <unk> and the others to flee . Hill and the <unk> also ran ; they revealed their positions to the fighters in their <unk> , but successfully hid themselves behind a ridge . After Hill and the others had hidden there for about two hours , they saw the attackers return to the crash site at about 19 : 45 . The guerrillas looted the wrecked cabin and some of the <unk> <unk> around the site , filled their arms with various passengers ' belongings , then left again . 
 The survivors were found over the following days by the Rhodesian Army and police ; Hill and Mr and Mrs Hansen were taken to <unk> Hospital , while <unk> and his group were <unk> to Andrew Fleming Hospital in Salisbury . 
 <unk> claimed responsibility for the attack in an interview with the BBC 's Today radio programme the next day , laughing as he did so , to the horror of most Rhodesian observers , both black and white . He said that he had received intelligence that the <unk> was being used for military purposes . <unk> said he regretted the deaths as it was not his party 's policy to kill civilians , and denied that his men had killed any survivors on the ground ; by contrast , he said that his men had helped them , and had left them alive . He also accused Air Rhodesia of <unk> <unk> troops and war materiel for the government , an allegation that Captain Pat Travers , Air Rhodesia 's general manager , called a " downright , deliberate lie " . 
 A report published in the American magazine Time a fortnight later described the incident as " a genuine horror story , calculated to make the most <unk> of Rhodesian <unk> <unk> seem true . " Indeed , the white community in Rhodesia heard the news with <unk> , and many turned their minds to exacting <unk> for what they and many others saw as an act of terrorism . The prominent Indian @-@ Rhodesian <unk> family was particularly affected by the incident , having lost eight members in the attack . Though Rhodesian authorities did not immediately acknowledge the cause of the crash , doing so only after four days ' investigation , the truth was common knowledge in Salisbury within hours . Smith wrote in his memoirs that the " degree of anger ... [ was ] difficult to control " . White South Africans were similarly enraged , particularly after reports appeared in the South African press that the <unk> had raped the female passengers before <unk> them . A Friends of Rhodesia Society in South Africa offered a reward of <unk> to anybody who would either kill <unk> or bring him to Salisbury to stand trial . 
 Several racially motivated incidents occurred over the following days . According to the Time article , a group of whites entered an <unk> Salisbury bar " fingering the <unk> of rifles " and forced blacks drinking there to leave . Time also reported a <unk> that two white youths , on learning of the massacre , shot the first black man they saw . Smith says that several would @-@ be <unk> groups sought his permission to venture into the bush around the crash site to " make the local people pay for their crime of <unk> and assisting the terrorists " . He instructed them not to , according to his memoirs , telling them that many rural blacks only assisted the guerrillas under extreme <unk> , and that it would not do to attack them . Many <unk> also resented the apparent lack of sympathy emanating from overseas governments , especially considering the character of the attack and its civilian target . 
 At a memorial service held on 8 September 1978 for Flight <unk> 's passengers and crew at Salisbury 's Anglican Cathedral , about 2 @,@ 000 people crowded inside , with another 500 standing outside on the steps and pavement , many listening to the service inside on portable radio sets . <unk> among those present in the cathedral were <unk> Air Rhodesia and South African Airways personnel , as well as Rhodesian Special Air Service soldiers and senior officers from other military units . Smith and several government ministers also attended , including P K van der <unk> , the co @-@ Minister of Foreign Affairs . 
 Dean John de Costa gave a sermon <unk> what he described as a " <unk> silence " from overseas . " Nobody who holds sacred the dignity of human life can be anything but <unk> at the events attending the Viscount , " he said . " But are we <unk> with the voice of protest from nations who call themselves <unk> ? We are not ! Like men in the story of the Good <unk> , they pass by on the other side ... The <unk> of this ill @-@ <unk> flight from <unk> will be burnt upon our memories for years to come . For others , far from our borders , it is an intellectual matter , not one which affects them deeply . Here is the tragedy ! " 
 The talks between Smith and the <unk> leader that had been progressing so <unk> were immediately halted by Salisbury . Smith himself called <unk> a " monster " . <unk> comments that the ending of the Smith – <unk> talks at this time was " potentially the most serious result of the Viscount massacre " , as the talks had been progressing well before the incident . He <unk> that an agreement between the two " at this critical stage " might have helped the transitional Rhodesian government to secure international recognition . 
 On 10 September , the Prime Minister announced to the nation that certain areas of the country would be placed under a variation of martial law , which he said would be applied in particular regions as and when needed . He declared Rhodesia 's intent to " <unk> the internal workings of those organisations associated with terrorism " , and warned neighbouring countries to prepare for " any defensive strikes we might undertake " against guerrilla bases in their respective territories . He claimed that the war had escalated because Britain and the United States were supporting the Patriotic Front . William Irvine , the co @-@ Minister of Transport , warned the guerrillas that Rhodesia " w [ <unk> ] not let these <unk> go <unk> " . 
 The Rhodesian attacks on ZANLA and <unk> bases did much to restore white morale following the Viscount incident , though they had not actually made much impact on the respective guerrilla campaigns . <unk> and the <unk> President Kenneth <unk> all the same requested further military aid and better weapons from the Soviets and the British respectively . Martial law was quickly extended across Rhodesia 's rural areas , and covered three @-@ quarters of the country by the end of 1978 . Air Rhodesia , meanwhile , began developing anti @-@ <unk> shielding for its <unk> . Before this work was completed , <unk> shot down a second Viscount , Air Rhodesia Flight <unk> , on 12 February 1979 . This time there were no survivors . 
 Following the second <unk> , Air Rhodesia created a system whereby the underside of the <unk> would be coated with low @-@ radiation paint , with the exhaust pipes concurrently <unk> . According to tests conducted by the Air Force , a Viscount so treated could not be detected by the <unk> 's targeting system once it was over 2 @,@ 000 feet ( 610 m ) . There were no further Viscount <unk> in Rhodesia . 
 In the elections held the following year under the Internal Settlement terms , boycotted by <unk> and <unk> , <unk> won a majority , and became the first Prime Minister of the reconstituted , majority @-@ ruled state of Zimbabwe Rhodesia on 1 June 1979 . This new order failed to win international acceptance , however , and in December 1979 the Lancaster House Agreement was agreed in London by Zimbabwe Rhodesia , the UK government and the Patriotic Front , returning the country to its former colonial status . The UK government suspended the constitution and took direct control for an interim period . Fresh elections were won by <unk> , who took power in April 1980 , concurrently with the country 's recognised independence as Zimbabwe . 
 In modern Zimbabwe , it is not the Viscount <unk> but rather the <unk> Rhodesian strikes against nationalist guerrilla camps that endure predominantly in the cultural memory . State media in Zimbabwe , prominently the Herald newspaper , often claim that Rhodesian forces <unk> and deliberately <unk> thousands of helpless refugees during such operations . <unk> 's <unk> of civilian planes is meanwhile portrayed as a legitimate act of war on the grounds that the guerrillas might have believed them to have military personnel or equipment on board . The massacre of surviving Flight <unk> passengers at the crash site is often omitted or attributed to forces other than <unk> ; in his 1984 memoirs <unk> repeated his claim that <unk> fighters had helped the survivors , and wrote simply that " I truly have no idea how the ten died " . 
 A monument to those killed in the Rhodesian attack on <unk> was built in Zambia in 1998 , and dedicated jointly by the <unk> and <unk> governments . A memorial to the victims of the two Rhodesian Viscount incidents , dubbed the Viscount Memorial , was erected on the grounds of the <unk> Monument in <unk> , South Africa in 2012 , and inaugurated on 1 September that year . The names of the dead passengers and crew are engraved on two granite slabs that stand upright , side by side , the pair topped by an emblem symbolising an aircraft . A pole beside the monument flies the Rhodesian flag . 
 <unk> was the capital of a conquest state that became one of the most powerful kingdoms of the ancient Maya . Though monumental architecture at the site dates back as far as the 4th century BC , <unk> reached its <unk> during the Classic Period , c . 200 to 900 AD . During this time , the city dominated much of the Maya region politically , economically , and militarily , while interacting with areas throughout <unk> such as the great metropolis of <unk> in the distant Valley of Mexico . There is evidence that <unk> was conquered by <unk> in the 4th century AD . Following the end of the Late Classic Period , no new major monuments were built at <unk> and there is evidence that elite palaces were burned . These events were coupled with a gradual population decline , culminating with the site ’ s abandonment by the end of the 10th century . 
 <unk> is the best understood of any of the large lowland Maya cities , with a long dynastic ruler list , the discovery of the tombs of many of the rulers on this list and the investigation of their monuments , temples and palaces . 
 The closest large modern settlements are Flores and Santa <unk> , approximately 64 kilometres ( 40 mi ) by road to the southwest . <unk> is approximately <unk> kilometres ( 188 mi ) north of Guatemala City . It is 19 kilometres ( 12 mi ) south of the contemporary Maya city of <unk> and 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) northwest of <unk> . The city was located 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) southeast of its great Classic Period rival , <unk> , and 85 kilometres ( 53 mi ) northwest of <unk> 's ally <unk> , now in Belize . 
 The city has been completely mapped and covered an area greater than 16 square kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 sq mi ) that included about 3 @,@ 000 structures . The topography of the site consists of a series of parallel limestone ridges rising above swampy lowlands . The major architecture of the site is clustered upon areas of higher ground and linked by raised <unk> spanning the swamps . The area around <unk> has been declared as the <unk> National Park and the preserved area covers 570 square kilometres ( 220 sq mi ) . 
 One of the largest of the Classic Maya cities , <unk> had no water other than what was collected from <unk> and stored in ten reservoirs . Archaeologists working in <unk> during the 20th century refurbished one of these ancient reservoirs to store water for their own use . 
 The <unk> National Park covers an area of 575 @.@ 83 square kilometres ( 222 @.@ 33 sq mi ) . It was created on 26 May 1955 under the auspices of the <unk> de <unk> e Historia and was the first protected area in Guatemala . 
 Population estimates for <unk> vary from 10 @,@ 000 to as high as 90 @,@ 000 inhabitants , with the most likely figure being at the upper end of this range . 
 The population of <unk> began a continuous curve of growth starting in the <unk> Period ( approximately 2000 BC – AD 200 ) , with a peak in the Late Classic with the population growing rapidly from AD 700 through to 830 , followed by a sharp decline . For the 120 square kilometres ( 46 sq mi ) area falling within the <unk> defenses of the hinterland , the peak population is estimated at <unk> per square kilometer ( <unk> per square mile ) . In an area within a 12 kilometres ( 7 @.@ 5 mi ) radius of the site core , peak population is estimated at 120 @,@ 000 ; population density is estimated at 265 per square kilometer ( <unk> per square mile ) . In a region within a 25 kilometres ( 16 mi ) radius of the site core and including some satellite sites , peak population is estimated at 425 @,@ 000 with a density of 216 per square kilometer ( 515 per square mile ) . These population figures are even more impressive because of the extensive <unk> that were unsuitable for habitation or agriculture . However , some archaeologists , such as David Webster , believe these figures to be far too high . 
 The dynastic line of <unk> , founded as early as the 1st century AD , spanned 800 years and included at least 33 rulers . 
 There are traces of early agriculture at the site dating as far back as 1000 BC , in the Middle <unk> . A <unk> of <unk> ceramics dating from about 700 @-@ 400 BC were found in a sealed <unk> , a subterranean bottle @-@ shaped chamber . 
 Major construction at <unk> was already taking place in the Late <unk> period , first appearing around 400 – 300 BC , including the building of major pyramids and platforms , although the city was still <unk> by sites further north such as El <unk> and <unk> . At this time , <unk> participated in the widespread <unk> culture that dominated the Central and Northern Maya areas at this time – a region that included the entire <unk> Peninsula including northern and eastern Guatemala and all of Belize . 
 Two temples dating to Late <unk> times had masonry @-@ walled <unk> that may have been <unk> @-@ vaulted , although this has not been proven . One of these had elaborate paintings on the outer walls showing human figures against a <unk> background , painted in yellow , black , pink and red . 
 In the 1st century AD rich burials first appeared and <unk> underwent a political and cultural <unk> as its giant northern neighbors declined . At the end of the Late <unk> , the <unk> style art and architecture from the Pacific Coast began to influence <unk> , as demonstrated by a broken sculpture from the <unk> and early murals at the city . 
 <unk> rulership among the lowland Maya is most deeply rooted at <unk> . According to later hieroglyphic records , the dynasty was founded by <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> , perhaps in the 3rd century AD . At the beginning of the Early Classic , power in the Maya region was concentrated at <unk> and <unk> , in the core of the Maya <unk> . 
 <unk> may have benefited from the collapse of the large <unk> states such as El <unk> . In the Early Classic <unk> rapidly developed into the most dynamic city in the Maya region , <unk> the development of other nearby Maya cities . 
 There appears to have been a breakdown in the male succession by AD 317 , when Lady <unk> <unk> conducted a <unk> @-@ ending ceremony , apparently as queen of the city . 
 <unk> <unk> , a small site 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) northeast of <unk> , was conquered by the latter during the reign of <unk> <unk> <unk> I. The site became an outpost of <unk> , shielding it from hostile cities further north , and also became a trade link to the Caribbean . 
 Around the 5th century an impressive system of fortifications consisting of ditches and earthworks was built along the northern periphery of <unk> 's hinterland , joining up with the natural defenses provided by large areas of <unk> lying to the east and west of the city . Additional fortifications were probably also built to the south . These defenses protected <unk> 's core population and agricultural resources , <unk> an area of approximately 120 square kilometres ( 46 sq mi ) . Recent research suggests that the earthworks served as a water collection system rather than a defensive purpose . 
 A long @-@ running rivalry between <unk> and <unk> began in the 6th century , with each of the two cities forming its own network of mutually hostile <unk> <unk> against each other in what has been likened to a long @-@ running war between two Maya <unk> . The kings of these two capitals adopted the title <unk> ' , a term that has not been precisely translated but that implies something akin to " high king " . 
 The early 6th century saw another queen ruling the city , known only as the " Lady of <unk> " , who was very likely a daughter of <unk> <unk> Ich 'aak II . She seems never to have ruled in her own right , rather being partnered with male co @-@ rulers . The first of these was <unk> ' B <unk> , who seems to have had a long career as a general at <unk> before becoming co @-@ ruler and 19th in the dynastic sequence . The Lady of <unk> herself seems not have been counted in the dynastic numbering . It appears she was later paired with lord " Bird Claw " , who is presumed to be the otherwise unknown 20th ruler . . 
 The beginning of the <unk> hiatus has served as a marker by which archaeologists commonly <unk> the Classic period of <unk> chronology into the Early and Late Classic . 
 In 682 , <unk> Chan K 'awiil I erected the first dated monument at <unk> in 120 years and claimed the title of <unk> ' , so ending the hiatus . He initiated a programme of new construction and turned the tables on <unk> when , in <unk> , he captured the enemy noble and threw the enemy state into a long decline from which it never fully recovered . After this , <unk> never again erected a monument celebrating a military victory . 
 By the 7th century , there was no active <unk> presence at any Maya site and the center of <unk> had been razed by 700 . Even after this , formal war attire illustrated on monuments was <unk> style . <unk> Chan K 'awiil I and his heir <unk> 'in Chan K 'awiil continued hostilities against <unk> and its allies and imposed firm regional control over the area around <unk> , extending as far as the territory around Lake <unk> <unk> . These two rulers were responsible for much of the impressive architecture visible today . 
 In 738 , <unk> , a vassal of <unk> , <unk> 's key ally in the south , switched allegiance to <unk> , defeated <unk> and gained its own independence . It appears that this was a conscious effort on the part of <unk> to bring about the collapse of <unk> 's southern allies . This upset the balance of power in the southern Maya area and lead to a steady decline in the fortunes of <unk> . 
 In the 8th century , the rulers of <unk> collected monuments from across the city and erected them in front of the North Acropolis . By the late 8th century and early 9th century , activity at <unk> slowed . <unk> architecture was still built but few hieroglyphic inscriptions refer to later rulers . 
 As <unk> and its hinterland reached peak population , the area suffered <unk> , erosion and nutrient loss followed by a rapid decline in population levels . <unk> and its immediate surroundings seem to have lost the majority of its population during the period from 830 to 950 and central authority seems to have collapsed rapidly . There is not much evidence from <unk> that the city was directly affected by the endemic warfare that afflicted parts of the Maya region during the Terminal Classic , although an influx of refugees from the <unk> region may have exacerbated problems resulting from the already stretched environmental resources . 
 The most likely cause of collapse at <unk> is <unk> and agrarian failure . The fall of <unk> was a blow to the heart of Classic Maya civilization , the city having been at the forefront of courtly life , art and architecture for over a thousand years , with an ancient ruling dynasty . However , new research regarding <unk> <unk> from the <unk> reservoir system suggests that a meteorological drought may have led to the abandonment of <unk> . 
 In <unk> , the Spanish <unk> Hernán Cortés passed within a few kilometres of the ruins of <unk> but did not mention them in his letters . After Spanish friar <unk> de <unk> became lost in the <unk> forests in early <unk> he described a ruin that may well have been <unk> . 
 In 1951 , a small airstrip was built at the ruins , which previously could only be reached by several days ' travel through the jungle on foot or mule . In 1956 the <unk> project began to map the city on a scale not previously seen in the Maya area . From 1956 through 1970 , major archaeological excavations were carried out by the University of Pennsylvania <unk> Project . They mapped much of the site and excavated and restored many of the structures . Excavations directed by Edwin M. <unk> and later by William Coe of the university investigated the North Acropolis and the Central Plaza from 1957 to 1969 . The <unk> Project recorded over 200 monuments at the site . In 1979 , the <unk> government began a further archeological project at <unk> , which continued through to 1984 . 
 <unk> George Lucas used <unk> as a filming location for the first Star Wars film , Episode IV : A New Hope , released in 1977 . Temple I at <unk> was featured on the reverse of the 50 <unk> <unk> . 
 <unk> is now a major tourist attraction surrounded by its own national park . A site museum has been built at <unk> ; it was completed in 1964 . 
 <unk> has been partially restored by the University of Pennsylvania and the government of Guatemala . It was one of the largest of the Classic period Maya cities and was one of the largest cities in the Americas . The architecture of the ancient city is built from limestone and includes the remains of temples that tower over 70 metres ( 230 ft ) high , large royal palaces , in addition to a number of smaller pyramids , palaces , residences , administrative buildings , platforms and inscribed stone monuments . There is even a building which seemed to have been a jail , originally with wooden bars across the windows and doors . There are also seven courts for playing the <unk> <unk> , including a set of 3 in the Seven Temples Plaza , a unique feature in <unk> . 
 The limestone used for construction was local and <unk> on @-@ site . The depressions formed by the extraction of stone for building were plastered to <unk> them and were used as reservoirs , together with some <unk> natural depressions . The main <unk> were surfaced with stucco and laid at a gradient that <unk> rainfall into a system of canals that fed the reservoirs . 
 The residential area of <unk> covers an estimated 60 square kilometres ( 23 sq mi ) , much of which has not yet been cleared , mapped , or excavated . A huge set of earthworks discovered by Dennis E. <unk> and Donald <unk> in the 1960s rings <unk> with a 6 @-@ metre ( 20 ft ) wide trench behind a rampart . The 16 square kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 sq mi ) area around the site core has been intensively mapped ; it may have enclosed an area of some 125 square kilometres ( 48 sq mi ) ( see below ) . Population estimates place the demographic size of the site between 10 @,@ 000 and 90 @,@ 000 , and possibly 425 @,@ 000 in the surrounding area . Recently , a project exploring the defensive earthworks has shown that the scale of the earthworks is highly variable and that in many places it is <unk> as a defensive feature . In addition , some parts of the <unk> were integrated into a canal system . The <unk> of <unk> varies significantly in coverage from what was originally proposed and it is much more complex and <unk> than originally thought . 
 By the Late Classic , a network of <unk> ( <unk> ) linked various parts of the city , running for several kilometres through its urban core . These linked the Great Plaza with Temple 4 ( located about 750 metres ( 2 @,@ 460 ft ) to the west ) and the Temple of the <unk> ( about 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) to the southeast ) . These broad <unk> were built of packed and plastered limestone and have been named after early explorers and archaeologists ; the Maler , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> . They assisted the passage everyday traffic during the rain season and also served as dams . 
 The Maler Causeway runs north from behind Temple I to Group H. A large bas @-@ relief is carved onto limestone bedrock upon the course of the causeway just south of Group H. It depicts two bound captives and dates to the Late Classic . 
 The <unk> Causeway runs southeast from the East Plaza to Temple VI , a distance of about 1 @.@ 3 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 81 mi ) . 
 The Great Plaza lies at the core of the site ; it is flanked on the east and west sides by two great temple @-@ pyramids . On the north side it is bordered by the North Acropolis and on the south by the Central Acropolis . 
 The North Acropolis , together with the Great Plaza immediately to the south , is one of the most studied architectural groups in the Maya area ; the <unk> Project excavated a massive trench across the complex , thoroughly investigating its construction history . It is a complex group with construction beginning in the <unk> Period , around 350 BC . It developed into a funerary complex for the ruling dynasty of the Classic Period , with each additional royal burial adding new temples on top of the older structures . After AD 400 a row of tall pyramids was added to the earlier Northern Platform , which measured 100 by 80 metres ( 330 by 260 ft ) , gradually hiding it from view . Eight temple pyramids were built in the 6th century AD , each of them had an elaborate <unk> and a stairway flanked by masks of the gods . By the 9th century AD , 43 stelae and 30 altars had been erected in the North Acropolis ; 18 of these monuments were carved with hieroglyphic texts and royal portraits . The North Acropolis continued to receive burials into the <unk> Period . 
 The South Acropolis is found next to Temple V. It was built upon a large basal platform that covers an area of more than 20 @,@ 000 square metres ( 220 @,@ 000 sq ft ) . 
 The Plaza of the Seven Temples is to the west of the South Acropolis . It is bordered on the east side by a row of nearly identical temples , by palaces on the south and west sides and by an unusual triple ballcourt on the north side . 
 Group G lies just south of the <unk> Causeway . The complex dates to the Late Classic and consists of palace @-@ type structures and is one of the largest groups of its type at <unk> . It has two stories but most of the rooms are on the lower floor , a total of 29 vaulted chambers . The remains of two further chambers belong to the upper storey . One of the entrances to the group was framed by a gigantic mask . 
 Group H is centered on a large plaza to the north of the Great Plaza . It is bordered by temples dating to the Late Classic . 
 There are nine Twin @-@ Pyramid <unk> at <unk> , one of which was completely dismantled in ancient times and some others were partly destroyed . They vary in size but consist of two pyramids facing each other on an east – west axis . These pyramids are flat @-@ topped and have <unk> on all four sides . A row of plain stelae is placed immediately to the west of the eastern pyramid and to the north of the pyramids , and lying roughly <unk> from them , there is usually a sculpted stela and altar pair . On the south side of these complexes there is a long vaulted building containing a single room with nine <unk> . The entire complex was built at once and these complexes were built at 20 @-@ year ( or k <unk> ) intervals during the Late Classic . The first twin pyramid complex was built in the early 6th century in the East Plaza . It was once thought that these complexes were unique to <unk> but rare examples have now been found at other sites , such as <unk> and <unk> , and they may reflect the extent of <unk> 's political dominance in the Late Classic . 
 Group Q is a twin @-@ pyramid complex , and is one of the largest at <unk> . It was built by <unk> <unk> <unk> II in <unk> in order to mark the end of the 17th K <unk> . Most of it has been restored and its monuments have been re @-@ erected . 
 There are thousands of ancient structures at <unk> and only a fraction of these have been excavated , after decades of archaeological work . The most prominent surviving buildings include six very large pyramids , labelled Temples I - VI , each of which support a temple structure on their <unk> . Some of these pyramids are over 60 metres ( 200 feet ) high . They were numbered <unk> during the early survey of the site . It is estimated that each of these major temples could have been built in as little as two years . 
 Temple II ( also known as the Temple of the Mask ) it was built around AD 700 and stands 38 metres ( 125 ft ) high . Like other major temples at <unk> , the summit shrine had three consecutive chambers with the <unk> spanned by wooden <unk> , only the middle of which was carved . The temple was dedicated to the wife of <unk> Chan K <unk> , although no tomb was found . The queen 's portrait was carved into the <unk> spanning the doorway of the summit shrine . One of the beams from this <unk> is now in the American Museum of Natural History in New York . 
 Temple III ( also known as the Temple of the Jaguar Priest ) was the last of the great pyramids to be built at <unk> . It stood 55 metres ( 180 ft ) tall and contained an elaborately sculpted but damaged roof <unk> , possibly showing Dark Sun engaged in a ritual dance around AD <unk> . The temple shrine possesses two chambers . 
 Temple IV is the tallest temple @-@ pyramid at <unk> , measuring 70 metres ( 230 ft ) from the plaza floor level to the top of its roof comb . Temple IV marks the reign of <unk> ’ in Chan <unk> ( Ruler B , the son of Ruler A or <unk> Chan K 'awiil I ) and two carved wooden <unk> over the doorway that leads into the temple on the pyramid ’ s summit record a long count date ( 9 @.@ 15 @.@ 10 @.@ 0 @.@ 0 ) that corresponds to CE <unk> ( <unk> 1994 : 169 ) . Temple IV is the largest pyramid built anywhere in the Maya region in the 8th century , and as it currently stands is the tallest pre @-@ Columbian structure in the Americas although the Pyramid of the Sun at <unk> may originally have been taller , as may have been one of the structures at El <unk> . 
 Temple V stands south of the Central Acropolis and is the mortuary pyramid of an as yet unidentified ruler . The temple stands 57 metres ( 187 ft ) high , making it the second tallest structure at <unk> - only Temple IV is taller . The temple has been dated to about AD 700 , in the Late Classic period , via <unk> analysis and the dating of ceramics associated with the structure places its construction during the reign of <unk> <unk> <unk> in the second half of the 7th century . 
 Temple VI is also known as the Temple of the <unk> and was dedicated in AD <unk> . It is notable for its 12 @-@ metre ( 39 ft ) high roof @-@ comb . <unk> of hieroglyphs cover the back and sides of the roof @-@ comb . The temple faces onto a plaza to the west and its front is <unk> . 
 Temple 33 was a funerary pyramid erected over the tomb of <unk> Chan K 'awiil I ( known as <unk> 48 ) in the North Acropolis . It started life in the Early Classic as a wide basal platform decorated with large stucco masks that flanked the stairway . Later in the Early Classic a new superstructure was added , with its own masks and decorated panels . During the Hiatus a third stage was built over the earlier constructions , the stairway was demolished and another royal burial , of an unidentified ruler , was set into the structure ( <unk> 23 ) . While the new pyramid was being built another high ranking tomb ( <unk> 24 ) was inserted into the rubble core of the building . The pyramid was then completed , standing 33 metres ( 108 ft ) tall . The final version of Temple 33 was completely dismantled by archaeologists in 1965 in order to arrive at the earlier stages of construction . 
 Structure 34 is a pyramid in the North Acropolis that was built by <unk> Chan K 'awiil II over the tomb of his father , <unk> <unk> <unk> I. The pyramid was topped by a three chambered shrine , the rooms situated one behind the other . 
 Structure <unk> @-@ 49 possesses a clear <unk> @-@ linked architectural style ; it has <unk> , an architectural feature that is very rare in the Maya region , and a <unk> @-@ <unk> façade ; it dates to the 4th century AD . It is located near to the Lost World pyramid . 
 Structure <unk> @-@ 53 is a small <unk> @-@ style platform that dates to about AD 600 . It had <unk> on all four sides and did not possess a superstructure . 
 Structure <unk> @-@ 96 is the central temple on the east side of the Plaza of the Seven Temples . It has been restored and its rear outer wall is decorated with skull @-@ and @-@ <unk> motifs . 
 Group <unk> @-@ 16 is an elite residential complex that has been thoroughly excavated . It lies a few hundred metres south of the Lost World Complex and the excavations have revealed elaborate stucco masks , <unk> murals , relief sculptures and buildings with <unk> characteristics . 
 The Great Plaza Ballcourt is a small ballcourt that lies between Temple I and the Central Acropolis . 
 The Bat Palace is also known as the Palace of Windows and lies to the west of Temple III . It has two <unk> , with a double range of chambers on the lower storey and a single range in the upper storey , which has been restored . The palace has ancient graffiti and possesses low windows . 
 Altar 5 is carved with two nobles , one of whom is probably <unk> Chan K 'awiil I. They are performing a ritual using the bones of an important woman . Altar 5 was found in Complex N , which lies to the west of Temple III . 
 Altar 8 is sculpted with a bound captive . It was found within Complex P in Group H and is now in the <unk> <unk> de <unk> y <unk> in Guatemala City . 
 Altar 9 is associated with Stela 21 and bears the sculpture of a bound captive . It is located in front of Temple VI . 
 Altar 10 is carved with a captive tied to a <unk> . It is in the northern enclosure of Group Q , a twin @-@ pyramid complex and has suffered from erosion . 
 Altar 35 is a plain monument associated with Stela 43 . The stela @-@ altar pair is <unk> located at the base of the stairway of Temple IV . 
 At <unk> , beams of <unk> wood were placed as <unk> spanning the inner <unk> of temples . These are the most elaborately carved wooden <unk> to have survived anywhere in the Maya region . 
 <unk> 3 from Temple IV was taken to Basel in Switzerland in the 19th century . It was in almost perfect condition and depicts <unk> 'in Chan K 'awiil seated on a <unk> . 
 Stelae are carved stone shafts , often sculpted with figures and hieroglyphs . A selection of the most notable stelae at <unk> follows : 
 Stela 1 dates to the 5th century and depicts the king <unk> Chan K 'awiil II in a standing position . 
 Stela 6 is a badly damaged monument dating to <unk> and bears the name of the " Lady of <unk> " who celebrated the end of the 4th K <unk> in that year . 
 Stela 10 is twinned with Stela 12 but is badly damaged . It described the accession of <unk> ' B <unk> in the early 6th century and earlier events in his career , including the capture of a prisoner depicted on the monument . 
 Stela 11 was the last monument ever erected at <unk> ; it was dedicated in <unk> by <unk> Chan K 'awiil II . 
 Stela 12 is linked to the queen known as the " Lady of <unk> " and king <unk> ' B <unk> . The queen is described as performing the year @-@ ending rituals but the monument was dedicated in honor of the king . 
 Stela 16 was dedicated in 711 , during the reign of <unk> Chan K 'awiil I. The sculpture , including a portrait of the king and a hieroglyphic text , are limited to the front face of the monument . It was found in Complex N , west of Temple III . 
 Stela 18 was one of two stelae erected by <unk> <unk> <unk> I to celebrate the k <unk> @-@ ending of AD <unk> . It was re @-@ erected at the base of Temple 34 , his funerary shrine . 
 Stela 20 was found in Complex P , in Group H , and was moved to the <unk> <unk> de <unk> y <unk> in Guatemala City . 
 Stela 21 was dedicated in <unk> by <unk> 'in Chan K 'awiil . Only the bottom of the stela is intact , the rest having been <unk> in ancient times . The surviving sculpture is of fine quality , consisting of the feet of a figure and of accompanying hieroglyphic text . The stela is associated with Altar 9 and is located in front of Temple VI . 
 Stela 22 was dedicated in <unk> by <unk> <unk> <unk> II in the northern enclosure of Group Q , a twin @-@ pyramid complex . The face of the figure on the stela has been <unk> . 
 Stela 23 was broken in antiquity and was re @-@ erected in a residential complex . The defaced portrait on the monument is that of the so @-@ called " Lady of <unk> " , a daughter of <unk> <unk> Ich 'aak II who became queen at the age of six but never ruled in her own right , being paired with male co @-@ rulers . It dates to the early 6th century . 
 Stela 24 was erected at the foot of Temple 3 in <unk> , accompanied by Altar 7 . Both were broken into fragments in ancient times , although the name of Dark Sun survives on three fragments . 
 Stela 26 was found in the summit shrine of Temple 34 , underneath a broken masonry altar . The monument had originally been erected at the base of the temple during the Early Classic period and was later broken , probably at the beginning of the Late Classic . Its remains were then interred within the temple shrine . 
 Stela 29 bears a Long Count ( 8 @.@ 12 @.@ 14 @.@ 8 @.@ 15 ) date equivalent to AD <unk> , the earliest surviving Long Count date from the Maya lowlands . The stela is also the earliest monument to bear the <unk> emblem glyph . It bears a sculpture of the king facing to the right , holding the head of an underworld jaguar god , one of the patron deities of the city . The stela was deliberately smashed during the 6th century or some time later , the upper portion was dragged away and dumped in a rubbish tip close to Temple III , to be uncovered by archaeologists in 1959 . 
 Stela 30 is the first surviving monument to be erected after the Hiatus . Its style and iconography is similar to that of <unk> , one of the more important of <unk> 's enemies . 
 Stela 32 is a fragmented monument with a foreign <unk> @-@ style sculpture apparently depicting the lord of that city with the attributes of the central Mexican storm god <unk> , including his <unk> eyes and <unk> headdress . 
 Stela 39 is a broken monument that was erected in the Lost World complex . The upper portion of the stela is missing but the lower portion shows the lower body and legs of <unk> <unk> Ich 'aak , holding a flint axe in his left hand . He is <unk> the figure of a bound , richly dressed captive . The monument is dated to AD <unk> . The text on the back of the monument describes a <unk> ritual to celebrate a <unk> @-@ ending . The stela also names <unk> <unk> Ich 'aak I 's father as K 'inich <unk> <unk> . 
 Stela 43 is paired with Altar 35 . It is a plain monument at the base of the stairway of Temple IV . 
 <unk> 1 is a tomb in the Lost World complex . A fine ceramic bowl was recovered from the tomb , with the handle formed from three @-@ dimensional head and neck of a bird emerging from the two @-@ dimensional body painted on the <unk> . 
 <unk> 10 is the tomb of <unk> <unk> <unk> . It is located beneath Structure 34 in the North Acropolis . The tomb contained a rich array of offerings , including ceramic vessels and food , and nine youths were sacrificed to accompany the dead king . A dog was also <unk> with the deceased king . <unk> in the tomb were <unk> and painted and many demonstrated a blend of Maya and <unk> styles . Among the offerings was an incense @-@ <unk> in the shape of an elderly underworld god , sitting on a stool made of human bones and holding a severed head in his hands . The tomb was sealed with a <unk> vault , then the pyramid was built on top . 
 <unk> 48 is generally accepted as the tomb of <unk> Chan K <unk> . It is located beneath Temple 33 in the North Acropolis . The chamber of the tomb was cut from the bedrock and contained the remains of the king himself together with those of two <unk> who had been sacrificed in order to accompany the deceased ruler . The walls of the tomb were covered with white stucco painted with hieroglyphs that included the Long Count date equivalent to 20 March 457 , probably the date of either the death or interment of the king . The king 's skeleton was missing its skull , its <unk> and one of its hands while the skeletons of the sacrificial victims were intact . 
 <unk> 116 is the tomb of <unk> Chan K 'awiil I. It is a large vaulted chamber deep within the pyramid , below the level of the Great Plaza . The tomb contained rich offerings of <unk> , ceramics , shell and works of art . The body of the king was covered with large quantities of <unk> ornaments including an enormous necklace with especially large beads , as depicted in sculpted portraits of the king . One of the outstanding pieces recovered from the tomb was an ornate <unk> mosaic vessel with the <unk> bearing a sculpted portrait of the king himself . 
 <unk> 195 was flooded with mud in antiquity . This flood had covered wooden objects that had completely <unk> away by the time the tomb was excavated , leaving <unk> in the dried mud . Archaeologists filled these <unk> with stucco and thus excavated four effigies of the god K 'awiil , the wooden originals long gone . 
 <unk> 196 is a Late Classic royal tomb that contained a <unk> mosaic vessel topped with the head of the <unk> God . 
 Tropical Storm <unk> was the tenth tropical storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season . <unk> developed out of a strong tropical wave which moved off the African coast on August 31 . The wave quickly became organized and was declared Tropical Depression Ten while located 170 mi ( 270 km ) to the south @-@ southeast of the Cape Verde Islands on September 2 . The depression was quickly upgraded to Tropical Storm <unk> around noon the same day . Over the next several days , <unk> moved in a general west @-@ northwest direction and reached its peak intensity early on September 3 . Strong wind shear , some due to the outflow of Hurricane Ike , and dry air caused the storm to weaken . On September 6 , the combination of wind shear , dry air , and cooling waters caused <unk> to weaken into a tropical depression . <unk> deteriorated into a remnant low shortly after as convection continued to dissipate around the storm . The low ultimately dissipated while located 520 mi ( 835 km ) east of <unk> on September 10 . However , the remnant moisture led to minor flooding on the island of St. Croix . 
 Tropical Storm <unk> formed as a tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of Africa near the end of August 2008 . It tracked south of Cape Verde and slowly developed , and on September 2 the disturbance became Tropical Depression Ten while located south @-@ southeast of the Cape Verde islands . As the depression became more organized , an eye @-@ like feature developed in the upper levels of the system . The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm <unk> six hours after forming . <unk> was located in an area which was supportive for rapid intensification but was not forecast to intensify quickly . 
 <unk> continued to intensify throughout the afternoon as the storm became more symmetrical . However , due to the location of the storm , there was a lack of accurate wind speed readings , and the National Hurricane Center was uncertain of its actual intensity . Despite the lack of wind shear around the storm , the center became slightly exposed and ceased further intensification . The storm was also heading into an area where shear was <unk> to significantly increase due to an upper @-@ level trough diving southward . Despite convection being partially removed from the center of <unk> , the storm intensified slightly in the early morning hours on September 3 as thunderstorm activity to the south of the center became more organized . The intensification was forecast to be short in duration as the trough to the north was deepening , causing the wind shear to the west to become stronger . 
 <unk> reached its peak intensity of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) around 8 a.m. ( <unk> ) as it continued to become more organized . However , there were indications that it had already begun to weaken . <unk> towards the north was becoming restricted and arc clouds began emanating from the storm , a sign that dry air was entering the system . During the afternoon hours , the structure of <unk> began to rapidly deteriorate as strong wind shear and dry air took their toll . By the late night , the center was almost completely exposed and only a band of convection persisted near the center . 
 The weakening trend continued through the afternoon as the storm was being affected by strong <unk> shear . <unk> became almost fully devoid of any convection by mid @-@ afternoon and the storm weakened to 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) , barely holding on to tropical storm status . <unk> regained a small amount of convection in the late night hours , but not enough to still be classified a tropical storm . Due to the lack of convection , <unk> was downgraded to a Tropical Depression at <unk> ( <unk> ) with winds of 35 mph ( 55 km / h ) . Since there was no convection around the system , it would have normally been classified a remnant low but , due to the possibility of the storm <unk> over the next several days , it was considered a tropical depression . The next morning , <unk> was downgraded to a remnant low as strong wind shear and dry air caused the demise of the storm . No redevelopment was expected with <unk> as it began to move over colder waters and remain under strong wind shear until it dissipated . 
 However , the remnant low associated with <unk> began to show signs of redevelopment during the afternoon on September 7 . <unk> around the system increased significantly and the low was no longer exposed . On September 8 , wind shear took over the system again . <unk> around the remnant low was torn away and the low was exposed once more . The National Hurricane Center did not state the chance of regeneration once the low became exposed . Finally , on September 9 , wind shear and dry air led to the remnants of <unk> deteriorating into an open wave . However , on September 10 , the remnants of <unk> redeveloped and global models picked up on the reformed system . Once more , the chance of regeneration was possible as the remnants of <unk> headed towards the Bahamas . However , on September 14 , dry air and wind shear caused the remnants to dissipate entirely . 
 As <unk> passed to the south of the Cape Verde islands on September 2 , outer rain bands produced minor rainfall , totaling around 0 @.@ 55 inches ( 14 mm ) . There were no reports of damage or flooding from the rain and overall effects were minor . 
 Several days after the low dissipated , the remnant moisture from <unk> brought showers and thunderstorms to St. Croix where up to 1 in ( 25 @.@ 4 mm ) of rain fell . The heavy rains led to minor street flooding and some urban flooding . No known damage was caused by the flood . 
 Mount <unk> is the highest summit of the Rocky Mountains of North America and the highest point in the U.S. state of Colorado and the entire Mississippi River drainage basin . The ultra @-@ prominent 14 @,@ 440 @-@ foot ( <unk> @.@ 2 m ) <unk> is the highest peak in the <unk> Range and the second @-@ highest summit in the contiguous United States after Mount Whitney . Mount <unk> is located in San Isabel National Forest , 12 @.@ 1 miles ( 19 @.@ 4 km ) southwest ( bearing 223 ° ) of the City of <unk> in Lake County , Colorado . 
 The mountain was named in honor of Colorado statesman Samuel <unk> <unk> , who was active in the formative period of the state and Governor of the Territory of Colorado from 1873 to 1874 . Henry W. <unk> of the <unk> Survey was the first to record an ascent of the peak , in 1874 . The <unk> and most popular climbing routes are categorized as Class 1 to 2 or A + in <unk> <unk> . Mount <unk> is therefore often referred to as the " gentle giant " that tops all others in the Rocky Mountains . 
 Weather conditions often change rapidly , and afternoon thunderstorms are common in the <unk> ; <unk> and snow are possible year @-@ round . An electrical storm on the mountain 's summit was considered remarkable enough to be reported in the July 1894 issue of Science . 
 Mount <unk> was named by miners in honor of Samuel <unk> <unk> , the governor of the then @-@ Territory of Colorado , because he brokered a treaty in September 1873 with the <unk> tribe that opened up more than 3 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 acres ( 12 @,@ 000 km2 ) of reservation land to mining and railroad activity . The first recorded ascent of the peak was by <unk> <unk> in 1874 , who was surveying the mountain as part of the <unk> Survey . 
 Some of the fauna reported on the climb to the summit include black bears , <unk> , mule deer , <unk> , and pocket <unk> ; there are also many species of <unk> . Elk , grouse , turkey and <unk> sheep are present in the area during the summer . 
 There are three main routes which ascend the mountain , all of which gain over 4 @,@ 100 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) of elevation . The standard route <unk> the peak from the east , starting from the Colorado Trail just north of Twin Lakes . The 4 @.@ 6 miles ( 7 @.@ 4 km ) long North ( Main ) <unk> Trail begins close to the <unk> Creek <unk> , and gains about 4 @,@ 500 feet ( 1 @,@ 400 m ) . The trail is open to <unk> , mountain <unk> and hunters during season . An easier , but longer route , the South <unk> Trail , is 5 @.@ 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 9 km ) long , climbing 4 @,@ 600 feet ( 1 @,@ 400 m ) at a less @-@ punishing gradient than the North <unk> Trail , approaching from the south and then climbing the eastern ridge . 
 The most difficult of the main routes is the Black Cloud Trail , a Class 2 climb that takes ten to fourteen hours depending on pace , gains 5 @,@ 300 feet ( 1 @,@ 600 m ) in elevation , and also involves an ascent of the sub @-@ peak , South <unk> , at 14 @,@ 134 feet ( 4 @,@ 308 m ) . Even healthy and experienced <unk> report great difficulty on this route , and despite the fact that there is a trail , the route is extremely steep , unstable , and rocky in places . The elevation gain is not evenly distributed over the 5 @.@ 5 @-@ mile ascent . There are also routes approaching from the western face , and southwestern ridge , from South <unk> Creek <unk> and Echo Canyon <unk> respectively . 
 Although strenuous and requiring physical fitness , none of the conventional routes require specialist <unk> skills or technical rock climbing . The main dangers of the mountain are those common to all high mountains , particularly altitude sickness . This can affect anyone , even those who are <unk> . In serious cases , it can lead to high @-@ altitude pulmonary <unk> and <unk> <unk> , which can lead to difficulties with breathing , <unk> , and death . <unk> are advised to begin their ascent at or before 6 a.m. and to summit and descend before early afternoon to minimize exposure to possible afternoon thunderstorms while at high altitudes . Although the most conventional form of ascent is by hiking , Anna Elizabeth Dickinson , the <unk> , ascended the mountain on a mule borrowed from the U.S. government . 
 The Church of Scientology has been present in Germany since 1970 . German authorities estimate that there are 4 @,@ 000 active Scientologists in Germany today ; the Church of Scientology gives a membership figure of around 12 @,@ 000 . The Church of Scientology has encountered particular <unk> from the German press and government and occupies a precarious legal , social and cultural position in Germany . 
 German courts have so far not resolved whether Scientology should be accorded the legal status of a religious or <unk> community , and different courts have reached contradictory conclusions . The German domestic intelligence service has monitored the organization 's activities . The German government does not recognize Scientology as a religion . It views it as an abusive business <unk> as a religion and believes that it pursues political goals that conflict with the values enshrined in the German constitution . This stance has been criticized , most notably by the U.S. government , which recognizes Scientology as a religion and has raised concerns about the violation of individual rights posed by sect <unk> . 
 Scientologists in Germany face specific political and economic restrictions . They are barred from membership in some major political parties , and businesses and other employers use so @-@ called " sect <unk> " to expose a prospective business partner 's or employee 's association with the organization . German federal and state interior ministers started a process aimed at banning Scientology in late 2007 , but abandoned the initiative a year later , finding insufficient legal grounds . Despite this , polls suggest that most Germans favor banning Scientology altogether . 
 Scientology , founded in the early 1950s in the United States by L. Ron Hubbard and today claiming to be represented in 150 countries , has been a very controversial new religious movement . Its stated <unk> aim is to " clear the planet " , to bring about an enlightened age in which every individual has overcome their psychological limitations . Scientology teaches that the source of people 's <unk> lies in " <unk> " , psychological <unk> acquired in the course of painful experiences , which can be cleared through a type of <unk> called " <unk> " made available by the Church of Scientology . 
 The fact that Scientologists have to pay large fees for <unk> and other Scientology services has brought controversy to Scientology throughout much of its history , with governments <unk> it as a profit @-@ making enterprise rather than as a religion . Critics maintain that Scientology is " a business @-@ driven , <unk> <unk> , totalitarian ideology with world @-@ dominating aspirations " , and that it tricks its members into parting with significant sums of money for Scientology courses . Scientology has fought <unk> lawsuits to defend itself against such charges and to pursue legal recognition as a religion . These efforts have been partly successful – Scientology has gained recognition as a tax @-@ exempt religious group in a number of countries , most notably in Australia in 1983 and the United States in 1993 , and in 2007 won an important case at the European Court of Human Rights , which <unk> Russia for failing to register Scientology as a religion . 
 The German government has said that it does not consider Scientology a religion , but a " commercial enterprise with a history of taking advantage of vulnerable individuals and an extreme dislike of any criticism " whose " totalitarian structure and methods may pose a risk to Germany 's democratic society " . Accordingly , the German government has taken a very strong stance against the organization . Germany is not alone in opposing Scientology ; in France , the Church of Scientology was convicted of organized fraud in October 2009 , after a court found that members had been manipulated into paying large sums for Scientology products , and the Church only narrowly escaped being banned altogether . Scientology is similarly controversial in Belgium , Greece and the UK . 
 On the subject of Scientology 's status as a religion , the German government has pointed to a 1995 decision by the Federal Labor Court of Germany . That court , noting Hubbard 's instruction that Scientologists should " make money , make more money – make other people produce so as to make more money " , came to the conclusion that " Scientology <unk> to be a ' church ' merely as a cover to pursue its economic interests " . In the same decision , the court also found that Scientology uses " <unk> and totalitarian practices " . Given the lessons of Germany 's 20th @-@ century history , in which the country came to be dominated by a fascist movement that started from similarly small beginnings , Germany is very wary of any ideological movement that might appear to be seeking a position of absolute power . <unk> in Scientology writings to the elimination of " parasites " and " <unk> " people who stand in the way of progress towards Scientology 's <unk> world " without <unk> , without criminals and without war " evoke uncomfortable parallels with Nazism , and have led to Scientology being classified as an " <unk> political movement " . 
 To further justify its stance , the German government has also pointed to the long history of U.S. court cases involving Scientology , including the conviction of 11 top Scientologists in 1979 and 1980 for a conspiracy involving the infiltration of U.S. government agencies , <unk> and the theft of government documents , a 1994 U.S. Supreme Court finding that Scientology practices took place in a " <unk> environment " , and Scientology 's track record of pursuing its critics through malicious court cases and private investigators . In examining the potential threat posed by Scientology the German government has noted that Scientology organizations are " structured so as to make the individual <unk> and financially dependent on a Scientology system " , and that members often abandon contact with friends and family . 
 Scientology first became active in Germany in 1970 . By 2007 , there were ten major centres ( " Scientology Churches " ) , as well as fourteen minor centres ( " Scientology <unk> " ) in Germany . The German Scientology Churches are located in the big cities – Munich , Hamburg , Berlin , Düsseldorf , Frankfurt am Main , Hanover and <unk> . Of the Scientology <unk> , nine are in Baden @-@ <unk> , and three in <unk> . Following German re @-@ unification , Scientology proved unable to gain significant numbers of followers in the territories of the former German Democratic Republic ; most adherents are found in Baden @-@ <unk> , <unk> and North @-@ Rhine <unk> . 
 Scientology is represented by a large number of independent associations or <unk> in Germany ; their umbrella organisation is the Scientology <unk> <unk> <unk> Germany 's domestic intelligence service , the <unk> für <unk> ( <unk> , or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution ) , estimates that there are 4 @,@ 000 Scientologists in Germany , down from earlier estimates of 5 @,@ 000 to 6 @,@ 000 . The Church of Scientology reported around 30 @,@ 000 members from the mid @-@ 1990s onwards ; this number remained stable for many years . However more recently Scientology has said it has only 12 @,@ 000 members . <unk> in Scientology membership numbers arise because the Church of Scientology applies more inclusive criteria in establishing its figures , essentially including anyone who has purchased a book or participated in courses , regardless of their subsequent involvement . The number of <unk> bound Scientology staff members working in German Scientology organizations is unlikely to exceed a few hundred . 
 Scientology formulated a " <unk> Germany " strategy in 1994 – similar to equivalent strategies pursued by Scientology in other countries and regions of the world – with the long @-@ term aim of transforming German society in line with the <unk> ideal : a non @-@ <unk> society in which Scientology enjoys <unk> influence . The programme sought to address Scientology 's image problems in Germany , to identify weak points in Germany that could be exploited for political gain , such as Germany 's National Socialist history , and to increase both membership figures and political influence in German society , with a special emphasis on <unk> Scientologists into key positions in industry and government . As most religions seek to widen their influence in society , such a programme could of course also be defended as a missionary effort , much like those many religions engage in . However , according to the <unk> , the strategy has not had any significant success . By 1998 , 90 government officials had been suspected of being Scientologists and in 48 cases the suspicions were confirmed , but apart from some isolated cases , most of the officials concerned had not used their positions to advertise Scientology . According to <unk> & <unk> ( 2009 ) , it is unknown to what degree the " <unk> Germany " programme is still being pursued . 
 <unk> by events such as the <unk> Siege in 1993 , the murders and suicides associated with the Order of the Solar Temple , and the 1995 <unk> <unk> incidents in Japan , German fears and concerns about new religious movements gained in intensity in the 1990s , with Scientology attracting particular attention . <unk> that Scientology had a totalitarian character were reinforced when Robert <unk> Young , an American ex @-@ Scientologist and former PR official in the Church of Scientology , visited German officials in late 1995 and wrote an article in Der <unk> , a widely @-@ read weekly magazine , describing Scientology as a totalitarian system operating a <unk> – the <unk> Project Force – for members of Scientology 's Sea Org found guilty of <unk> . From the mid @-@ 1990s onward , press articles , reports and essays on Scientology appeared on an almost daily basis , accompanied by books and television programmes that reached a mass audience . 
 As noted by the religious scholar Hubert <unk> , Scientology came to be seen as a " serious political danger that not only threatened to turn individuals into will @-@ less zombies , but was also conspiring to overthrow the democratic constitution of the state " . This view of Scientology as a public enemy , <unk> adds , " became a matter of political <unk> " : senior political figures became involved in launching campaigns against Scientology , and being suspected of any association with it resulted in social <unk> . Stephen A. Kent , writing in 1998 , noted that officials at all levels of German government shared the insistence that Scientology should be suppressed . Scientology was viewed as " a totalitarian , business @-@ driven organization [ ... ] guilty of significant human rights abuses . " Officials examining primary and secondary sources , legal documents , and the testimony of former members , concluded that the organization was " <unk> to a democratic state " . Federal <unk> and state governments were asked to use all legal means at their disposal to check the activities of Scientology . 
 Government publications on the dangers of <unk> increased between 1996 and 1998 , and a significant number of them dealt with the Church of Scientology . The German courts had approved such publications in 1989 , seeing them as part of the government 's responsibility to keep the public informed , and finding that they did not interfere with religious freedom . In 1996 , the German parliament launched an <unk> ( <unk> ) Commission to investigate <unk> and similar groups , in large part because of public concerns about Scientology . Its final report , published in June 1998 , concluded that Scientology , alone among new religious movements , required monitoring by Germany 's domestic intelligence services . 
 An area of widespread concern in the German media has been the alleged " infiltration " of businesses by Scientologists , in line with Scientology 's declared aim to penetrate society , politics and business in preparation for world domination . Attempts to infiltrate businesses have reportedly been most successful among small and medium @-@ size companies , such as estate agents , management consultants and management @-@ training companies . Management @-@ consultancy firms led by Scientologists often conceal their association with Scientology ; once they have recruited members of their clients ' upper management , these managers may send employees to Scientology trainers , as part of company education and training programmes , without informing them as to the origin of the training methods used . An expensive commercial version of Scientology 's Oxford <unk> Analysis , usually offered free as part of Scientology <unk> in public places , temporarily entered some major German companies ( who were unaware of its <unk> ) via such a management @-@ consultancy firm . 
 In the mid @-@ 2000s , German sect experts expressed concerns that Scientologists were becoming active in the German after @-@ school <unk> market . These concerns arose because customers of around 20 after @-@ school <unk> centres operated by Scientologists in Frankfurt , Hamburg , <unk> and elsewhere might be unaware that their children were being taught by Scientologists , using Scientology methods . <unk> advertising the <unk> services would at most mention the name of L. Ron Hubbard , the founder of Scientology , but not Scientology itself . 
 In early 2008 , Thomas <unk> , <unk> Commissioner of the German Lutheran Church in Berlin and <unk> , and the historian <unk> Knopp both likened the Scientologist Hollywood actor Tom Cruise to Goebbels , the Nazi propaganda minister . <unk> and Knopp cited a leaked Scientology video in which Cruise was seen asking the audience whether Scientologists should " clean up " the world , the audience responding with enthusiastic cheers – cheers which <unk> and Knopp felt were reminiscent of the audience 's response to Goebbels ' famous question , " Do you want total war ? " <unk> 's and Knopp 's comments found few critics in Germany . Most Germans consider Scientology a <unk> organization . In 1997 , Time reported that 70 % of Germans favoured banning Scientology ; a poll conducted in September 2008 by Der <unk> found 67 % support for a ban . 
 In 2010 a German public broadcaster , <unk> , showed the film Until Nothing Remains , a <unk> account of the effect Scientology had on one German family . Said to be based on a true story , the film attracted widespread media attention and a viewership of 8 @.@ 69 million . 
 While there have been calls for Scientology to be banned , the Church of Scientology remains legal in Germany and is allowed to operate there . Its precise legal status however is unresolved . Two points are contested : first , whether or not the teachings of Scientology qualify as a " religion or <unk> " ( Religion or <unk> ; these are equal before German law ) , and <unk> , whether or not these teachings are only used as a pretext for purely commercial activity ; if the latter were the case , this would most likely imply that Scientology would not qualify for protection as a " religious or <unk> community " ( <unk> oder <unk> ) under Article 4 of the German constitution , which guarantees the freedom of belief , religion and <unk> . Status as a " religious or <unk> community " also affects a broad range of other issues in Germany , such as taxation and freedom of association . 
 The Federal Court of Justice of Germany has not yet made an explicit decision on the matter , but implicitly assumed in 1980 that Scientology represented a religious or <unk> community . The Upper Administrative Court in Hamburg explicitly asserted in 1994 that Scientology should be viewed as a <unk> community . In 1995 , the Federal Labor Court of Germany decided that the Church of Scientology merely pursued commercial aims and did not represent a religious or <unk> community entitled to protection under Article 4 of the German Constitution , although another decision by the same court left the question open again in 2003 . In another 2003 decision , the Administrative Court of Baden @-@ <unk> in <unk> said there were no indications that the teachings of Scientology merely served as a pretext for commercial activity . In 2005 , the Federal Administrative Court of Germany explicitly granted a Scientologist protection under Article 4 @.@ 1 of the German Constitution , which declares the freedom of religion and <unk> <unk> . 
 Many courts have declined to assess the religious status of Scientology , finding that the question was irrelevant to deciding the case at hand . The Federal Administrative Court for example ruled in 1997 that the question whether or not Scientology was a religion was irrelevant , and that its legal status should be judged by its business activities . The German government does not consider the Church of Scientology to be a religious or <unk> community and asserts that Scientology is a profit @-@ making enterprise , rather than a religion . Recent years have seen a number of court decisions in Scientology 's favour , despite the very widespread negative attitude to Scientology among politicians and the general public . 
 Given the history of Nazism 's rise to power in Germany in the 1930s , the present German state has committed itself to taking active steps to prevent the rise of any ideology that threatens the values enshrined in the German constitution . The <unk> domestic intelligence service ( <unk> für <unk> , or Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution ) regards the aims of Scientology as running counter to Germany 's free and democratic order , and has been monitoring Scientology since 1997 , as have the <unk> for the Protection of the Constitution in a number of German <unk> . Minister for Family Policy <unk> <unk> instituted the surveillance , saying that the church had totalitarian tendencies and that she would oppose Scientology with all the means at her disposal . 
 The German Church of Scientology has repeatedly challenged the legality of this surveillance in court . In December 2001 , the Administrative Court in Berlin ruled against the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution and ordered it to stop the recruitment and deployment of staff and members of the Church of Scientology Berlin as paid <unk> . The court ruled that the use of <unk> was <unk> . In 2003 , the same court ruled that it was illegal for the Berlin Office for the Protection of the Constitution to include the activities of Scientology in its report , given that the report did not document any activities that were opposed to the constitution . 
 At the federal level , Scientology lost a complaint against continued surveillance by the <unk> in November 2004 . The federal court based its opinion on its judgment that the aims of Scientology , as outlined by L. Ron Hubbard in his writings , were incompatible with the German constitution . <unk> acting for the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution pointed out that Hubbard had written that civil rights , for example , should be restricted to Scientologists , and they asserted that the Scientology organization was taking systematic steps to infiltrate society and government institutions in order to prevent anti @-@ Scientology legislation . <unk> counsel acting for the Church of Scientology had contended that Scientology was non @-@ political , its aims were the liberation of the human being , and that Hubbard 's instructions were valid only within the Church of Scientology and were subject to interpretation , and at any rate there was no effort to implement these instructions in Germany . The court disagreed and ruled that many sources , some of them not accessible to the general public , indicated that the aims of the Church of Scientology did include the <unk> of the principle of equality and other essential human rights . 
 In <unk> , surveillance was stopped by a court as inappropriate in 2005 , because there is no local branch of Scientology and few members . As of 6 May 2008 , the Church of Scientology in Germany dropped the legal battle to prevent surveillance of its activities by the <unk> after the North Rhine @-@ <unk> Higher Administrative Court in <unk> refused to hear an appeal on the matter . Being suspected of maintaining " ambitions against the free , democratic basic order " , the Scientology organization added a declaration on human rights and democracy to its <unk> . 
 There is at least one example of surveillance of Scientology by the German intelligence services outside of Germany . In 1998 , the Swiss government detained an agent of the German government , charging him with " carrying out illegal business for a foreign state , working for a political information service and <unk> identity documents " . The German government posted bail for the agent . He was eventually given a 30 @-@ day suspended jail sentence for <unk> on Scientology , and the German government apologized to Switzerland for the incident . 
 A " sect filter " , also known as a " protective declaration " ( <unk> ) , is a document that requires prospective business partners or employees to acknowledge any association with a sect or new religious movement before entering a business or employment contract . Such sect <unk> , primarily used to screen out Scientologists , have been drafted by German government agencies for use by businesses . " <unk> commissioner 's " offices exist in Germany as part of regional or local government . 
 A work instruction introduced in 1996 requires government staff in the <unk> – local employment agencies and social security offices operated by the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs – to mark companies owned by Scientologists with the letter " S " . Where companies are suspected of having Scientologist staff , prospective employees are alerted to this fact by government staff . Government officials have publicised the names of individual Scientologists and conducted media campaigns against their businesses ; some <unk> have placed advertisements in the press saying they are not Scientologists in order to avoid the associated stigma . 
 Due to concerns about possible government infiltration by Scientologists , applicants for civil service positions in <unk> are required to declare whether or not they are Scientologists , and a similar policy has been instituted in <unk> . Companies <unk> for government contracts were likewise required to state they are not Scientologists ; in 2001 , this requirement was changed , and firms are now asked to sign a form stating that " the technology of L. Ron Hubbard will not be used in executing the contract " . When it became known that Microsoft 's Windows 2000 operating system included a disk <unk> developed by Executive Software International ( a company headed by a Scientologist ) , this caused concern among German government officials and clergy over data security and the potential for espionage . To <unk> these concerns , Microsoft Germany agreed to provide a means to <unk> the utility . Following letters of complaint about discrimination from Scientology lawyers , some American companies such as General Electric , IBM and Ford Motor Company instructed their German <unk> to cease the use of protective declarations . 
 The city @-@ state of Hamburg set up a full @-@ time office dedicated to opposing Scientology , the Scientology Task Force for the Hamburg Interior Authority , under the leadership of <unk> <unk> . In 2005 , in a case brought by a Scientologist , the Federal Administrative Court of Germany ordered the city of Hamburg to cease recommending the use of protective declarations to its business community , finding that the practice <unk> religious freedom . In June 2008 , the Hamburg Administrative Court fined the city of Hamburg 5 @,@ 000 <unk> ( $ 7 @,@ 000 ) for not <unk> with court instructions banning the use of " sect <unk> . " Internet links to sample <unk> to be used by businesses had continued to remain available . <unk> Barker , a professor of sociology at the London School of Economics , has noted that " Germany has gone further than any other Western European country in <unk> the civil rights of Scientologists . " The Hamburg task force was closed down in August 2010 as a result of budget cuts ; <unk> moved to a position within the Hamburg interior authority , where she continues her work on Scientology . 
 In 2010 , the Bavarian Administrative Court ruled that a woman working in a children 's <unk> centre , whose employment had been terminated when her ex @-@ husband identified her as a Scientologist , should be reinstated . The woman had demonstrated to the court 's satisfaction that her <unk> beliefs were irrelevant to her work . According to the agreement that concluded the case , she promised not to use Scientology methods in her work , and to inform the children 's parents of her membership in Scientology . 
 In March 2007 , it was reported that German authorities were increasing their efforts to monitor Scientology in response to the opening of a new Scientology headquarters in Berlin . On December 7 , 2007 , German federal and state interior ministers expressed the opinion that the Scientology organization was continuing to pursue anti @-@ constitutional goals , <unk> " essential basic and human rights like the dignity of man or the right to equal treatment " , and asked Germany 's domestic intelligence agencies to collect and evaluate the information required for a possible judicial inquiry aimed at banning the organization . 
 The move was criticized by German politicians from all sides of the political spectrum , with legal experts and intelligence agencies expressing concern that an attempt to ban the organization would likely fail in the courts . Sabine Weber , president of the Church of Scientology in Berlin , called the accusations " unrealistic " and " absurd " and said that the German interior ministers ' evaluation was based on " a few sentences out of 500 @,@ 000 pages of <unk> literature " . She added , " I can also find hundreds of quotes in the Bible that are totalitarian but that doesn 't mean I will demand the ban of Christianity . " 
 In November 2008 , the government abandoned its attempts to ban Scientology , after finding insufficient evidence of illegal or unconstitutional activity . The report by the <unk> cited knowledge gaps and noted several points that would make the success of any legal undertaking to ban Scientology doubtful . First , the <unk> report stated there was no evidence that Scientology could be viewed as a foreign organization ; there were German churches and missions , a German board , German <unk> , and no evidence that the organization was " totally remote @-@ controlled " from the United States . A foreign organization would have been much easier to ban than a German one . The second argument on which those proposing the ban had counted was Scientology 's aggressive opposition to the constitution . Here , the report found that Scientology 's behaviour gave no grounds to assume that Scientology aggressively sought to attack and overthrow Germany 's free and democratic basic order . " Neither its <unk> nor any other utterances " supported the " conclusion that the organization had criminal aims " . The <unk> also considered whether there were grounds to act against the Church of Scientology on the basis that they were <unk> medicine without a licence , but expressed doubts that a court would accept this reasoning . 
 Commenting on the decision to drop the ban attempt , <unk> <unk> , Berlin 's interior minister , said , " This organization pursues goals – through its writings , its concept and its disrespect for minorities – that we cannot tolerate and that we consider in violation of the constitution . But they put very little of this into practice . The appraisal of the Government at the moment is that [ Scientology ] is a <unk> organization , but it is not an organization that we have to take a hammer to . " The Church of Scientology expressed satisfaction with the decision , describing it as the " only one possible " . <unk> of Scientology 's activities by the German intelligence services continues . 
 In February 2009 , the Berlin Administrative Court ruled that a poster placed by local city authorities on an advertising column next to a bus stop in front of the Berlin Scientology headquarters , warning <unk> @-@ by of the potential dangers Scientology activities posed to democracy and individual freedom , should be removed . The decision was upheld in July 2009 by the Upper Administrative Court of Berlin @-@ <unk> which ruled that the poster violated Scientologists ' basic religious rights . 
 The United States media , while generally reporting negatively on Scientology in domestic news , has taken an at least partially supportive stance towards Scientology in relation to Germany . Richard Cohen for example , writing in the Washington Post , said in 1996 : " Scientology might be one weird religion , but the German reaction to it is <unk> still – not to mention disturbing . " Alan Cowell , writing in the New York Times , wrote in 1997 that the German response to Scientology – motivated by officials ' fear that Scientology " was a totalitarian movement growing , like the Nazi party , from <unk> beginnings " – was itself <unk> of " the Nazi era 's <unk> " . 
 The U.S. Department of State has repeatedly claimed that Germany 's actions constitute government and societal discrimination against minority religious groups and expressed its concerns over the violation of Scientologists ' individual rights posed by sect <unk> . The U.S. Department of State began to include the issue of Scientology in Germany in its annual human rights reports after the 1993 agreement between the Church of Scientology and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service , through which Scientology gained the status of a tax @-@ exempt religion in the United States . That decision also marked the beginning of more intense lobbying efforts by the Church of Scientology in Washington , using paid <unk> . The State Department 's 1996 human rights report on Germany , released in January 1997 , warned that artists and businesses with Scientology connections " may face boycotts and discrimination , sometimes with government approval . " Past targets of such actions had included Scientologist actors Tom Cruise and John <unk> , as well as jazz pianist Chick <unk> . 
 Also in January 1997 , an open letter to then @-@ Chancellor <unk> <unk> appeared , published as a newspaper advertisement in the International Herald Tribune , drawing parallels between the " organized oppression " of Scientologists in Germany and Nazi policies <unk> by Germany in the 1930s . The letter was conceived and paid for by Hollywood lawyer <unk> Fields , whose clients have included Tom Cruise and John <unk> , and was signed by 34 prominent figures in the U.S. entertainment industry , including the top executives of MGM , Warner Bros. , Paramount , Universal and Sony Pictures Entertainment as well as actors Dustin Hoffman and Goldie <unk> , director Oliver Stone , writers Mario <unk> and <unk> Vidal and talk @-@ show host Larry King . It echoed similar parallels drawn by the Church of Scientology itself , which until then had received <unk> notice , and was followed by lobbying efforts of Scientology celebrities in Washington . 
 U.S. Department of State spokesman Nicholas Burns rejected the Nazi comparisons in the open letter as " <unk> " and distanced the U.S. government from Nazi comparisons made by the Church of Scientology , saying , " We have criticized the Germans on this , but we aren 't going to support the Scientologists ' terror tactics against the German government . " Chancellor <unk> , commenting on the letter , said that those who signed it " don 't know a thing about Germany and don 't want to know . " German officials argued that " the whole fuss was <unk> up by the Scientologists to achieve what we won 't give them : tax @-@ exempt status as a religion . This is <unk> , pure and simple . " Officials explained that precisely because of Germany 's Nazi past , Germany took a determined stance against all " radical cults and <unk> , including right @-@ wing Nazi groups " , and not just against Scientology . <unk> 's Christian Democratic Union party denounced the letter as " absurd " and cited German court <unk> stating that Scientology had primarily economic goals and could legitimately be referred to using phrases such as a " <unk> <unk> of oppression " . 
 In February 1997 , a United States immigration court judge granted <unk> to a German Scientologist who claimed she would be subject to religious persecution in her homeland . In April 1997 , John <unk> met personally with U.S. President Bill Clinton at a conference in Philadelphia . <unk> later said Clinton assured him that he would " really love to help " with the " issue over in Germany with Scientology " . According to <unk> , Clinton recalled that " he had a roommate years ago who was a Scientologist and had really liked him , and respected his views on it " , stating that Scientologists " were given an unfair hand in [ Germany ] and that he wanted to fix it " . In September 1997 , John <unk> , Chick <unk> and fellow Scientologist Isaac Hayes were heard by the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe ( <unk> , also known as the Helsinki Commission ) , voicing their complaints about the treatment of Scientologists in Germany , and had a briefing with United States National Security <unk> Sandy Berger , whom Clinton had assigned to be " the administration 's Scientology point person " . The German ambassador responded with a letter to the <unk> stating that the German government had come to the conclusion that Scientology 's " pseudo @-@ scientific courses can seriously jeopardize individuals ' mental and physical health and that it exploits its members " , adding that " membership can lead to psychological and physical dependency , to financial ruin , and even to suicide . In addition , there are indications that Scientology poses a threat to Germany 's basic political principles . " 
 A United Nations report in April 1998 raised concerns about the violation of individual rights posed by sect <unk> . However , it rejected the comparison of the treatment of Scientologists with that of Jews during the Nazi era . 
 In 2000 , the German Stern magazine published the results of its investigation of the <unk> case . It asserted that several rejection letters which the woman had submitted as part of her <unk> application – ostensibly from potential employers who were rejecting her because she was a Scientologist – had in fact been written by fellow Scientologists at her request and that of Scientology 's Office of Special Affairs , and that she was in personal financial trouble and about to go on trial for tax <unk> at the time she applied for <unk> . On a 2000 visit to Clearwater , Florida , <unk> <unk> of the Scientology Task Force for the Hamburg Interior Authority likewise alleged that the <unk> case had been part of an " orchestrated effort " by Scientology undertaken " for political gain " , and " a spectacular abuse of the U.S. system " . German expatriate Scientologists resident in Clearwater , in turn , accused <unk> of <unk> a " hate campaign " in Germany that had " ruined the lives and fortunes of scores of Scientologists " and maintained that Scientologists had not " exaggerated their plight for political gain in the United States . " Mark <unk> , a ( former ) top Church of Scientology official , said that although Scientology had not orchestrated the case , " there would have been nothing improper if it had . " 
 The U.S. Department of State 's 2012 report on religious freedom in Germany , published in 2013 , stated that " The status of the Church of Scientology remains in <unk> . The Constitutional Court and various courts at the state level have not explicitly ruled that Scientology is a religion . Government agencies at the federal and state level have rules and procedures that discriminate against Scientology as a group and against its members . Four of the major political parties ( the Christian Democratic Union , Christian Social Union , Social Democratic Party , and Free Democratic Party ) ban Scientologists from party membership . [ ... ] Scientologists reported instances of governmental discrimination . Although courts at the state and federal level condemned the improper use of so @-@ called ' sect <unk> ' to <unk> and boycott Scientologists , they remained in use in the public sector . ' <unk> <unk> ' typically asked potential new employees to confirm in writing that they had no contact with Scientology , did not participate in its training courses , and rejected its doctrines . [ ... ] Catholic and Protestant churches continued to oppose Scientology <unk> [ sic ] , although press reporting and public reactions to Scientology decreased . Several private organizations issued warnings about after @-@ school study programs run by Scientologists . "

 Asahi ( <unk> , Asahi ) was a pre @-@ dreadnought battleship built for the Imperial Japanese Navy ( <unk> ) in the late 1890s . As Japan lacked the industrial capacity to build such warships itself , the ship was designed and built in the United Kingdom . Shortly after her arrival in Japan , she became flagship of the Standing Fleet , the <unk> 's primary combat fleet . She participated in every major naval battle of the Russo @-@ Japanese War of 1904 – 05 and was lightly damaged during the Battle of the Yellow Sea and the Battle of <unk> . Asahi saw no combat during World War I , although the ship participated in the Siberian Intervention in 1918 . 
 <unk> as a coastal defence ship in 1921 , Asahi was disarmed two years later to meet the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty , after which she served as a training and submarine depot ship . She was modified into a submarine salvage and rescue ship before being placed in reserve in 1928 . Asahi was recommissioned in late 1937 , after the start of the Second <unk> @-@ Japanese War , and used to transport Japanese troops . In 1938 , she was converted into a repair ship and based first at Japanese @-@ occupied Shanghai , China , and then Cam <unk> Bay , French Indochina , from late 1938 to 1941 . The ship was transferred to occupied Singapore in early 1942 to repair a damaged light cruiser and ordered to return home in May . She was sunk en route by the American submarine USS Salmon , although most of her crew survived . 
 Combat experience in the First <unk> @-@ Japanese War of 1894 – 95 convinced the Imperial Japanese Navy of weaknesses in the <unk> École naval philosophy , which emphasized torpedo boats and commerce raiding to offset expensive heavily armoured ships . Therefore , Japan promulgated a ten @-@ year naval build @-@ up in early 1896 , to modernize and expand its fleet in preparation for further confrontations , with the construction of six battleships and six armoured cruisers at its core . These ships were paid for from the £ 30 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 indemnity paid by China after losing the First <unk> @-@ Japanese War . As with the earlier Fuji and <unk> classes , Japan lacked the technology and capability to construct its own battleships , and turned again to the United Kingdom for the four remaining battleships of the programme . Asahi , the fifth Japanese battleship to be built in Britain , was ordered from the <unk> Engineering & Shipbuilding Company shipyard in <unk> , Scotland in the 1897 annual naval programme . 
 Asahi 's design was a modified version of the <unk> @-@ class battleships of the Royal Navy , with two additional 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) guns . The ship had an overall length of 425 feet 3 inches ( 129 @.@ 6 m ) , a beam of 75 feet ( 22 @.@ 9 m ) , and a normal draught of 27 feet 3 inches ( 8 @.@ 3 m ) . She displaced 15 @,@ 200 long tons ( 15 @,@ 400 t ) at normal load . Asahi had a complete double bottom with 55 <unk> compartments . Her hull was also subdivided into 223 <unk> compartments . She was fitted as a flagship and her crew numbered about <unk> officers and enlisted men , including the admiral 's staff . 
 The ship was powered by two vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines built by <unk> , Tennant , each driving one propeller , using steam generated by 25 Belleville boilers at a working pressure of 17 @.@ 03 bar ( 1 @,@ 703 <unk> ; 247 <unk> ) . The engines were rated at 15 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 11 @,@ 000 kW ) , using forced draught , and designed to reach a top speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) although Asahi reached 18 @.@ 3 knots ( 33 @.@ 9 km / h ; 21 @.@ 1 mph ) from 16 @,@ <unk> indicated horsepower ( 12 @,@ 181 kW ) during her sea trials on 23 March 1900 . She carried a maximum of 2 @,@ 000 long tons ( 2 @,@ 032 t ) of coal which allowed her to steam for 9 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 17 @,@ 000 km ; 10 @,@ 000 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . The ship was fitted with three steam @-@ driven 4 @.@ 8 @-@ <unk> ( 6 @.@ 4 hp ) <unk> . 
 Asahi 's main battery consisted of the same four <unk> Ordnance Company 40 @-@ calibre twelve @-@ inch guns used in all of Japan 's preceding battleships . They were mounted in twin @-@ gun turrets fore and aft of the superstructure . The <unk> powered mountings allowed the guns to be loaded at all angles of traverse , at a fixed elevation of + 13 @.@ 5 ° . Each mount could traverse a total of 240 degrees . They fired 850 @-@ pound ( 386 kg ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 400 ft / s ( 730 m / s ) . 
 The ship 's secondary armament consisted of fourteen 45 @-@ calibre 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) quick @-@ firing ( QF ) guns mounted in casemates . Eight of these guns were positioned on the main deck and the other six guns were placed above them in the superstructure . They fired 100 @-@ pound ( 45 kg ) shells at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 300 ft / s ( 700 m / s ) . Protection against torpedo @-@ boat attacks was provided by twenty QF 12 @-@ pounder 12 cwt guns . The 12 @-@ pounders fired 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) , 12 @.@ 5 @-@ pound ( 5 @.@ 7 kg ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ <unk> ft / s ( <unk> m / s ) . <unk> guns consisted of eight 47 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) three @-@ pounder <unk> guns and four 47 @-@ millimetre 2 @.@ 5 @-@ pounder <unk> guns . The former were mounted in the superstructure and the latter in the fighting tops . The three @-@ pounder gun fired 3 @.@ 19 @-@ pound ( 1 @.@ 45 kg ) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ <unk> ft / s ( <unk> m / s ) , while the 2 @.@ 5 @-@ pounder fired 2 @.@ 5 @-@ pound ( 1 @.@ 1 kg ) shells at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 420 ft / s ( 430 m / s ) . The ship was also equipped with four submerged 18 @-@ inch torpedo tubes , two on each broadside . 
 The waterline main belt of Asahi consisted of Harvey armour 8 feet ( 2 @.@ 44 m ) high , of which 3 feet 8 inches ( 1 @.@ 11 m ) was above the waterline at normal load , and had a maximum thickness of 9 inches ( <unk> mm ) for the middle 224 feet ( 68 @.@ 28 m ) of the ship . It was only 4 inches ( 102 mm ) thick at the ends of the ship and was surmounted by a six @-@ inch <unk> of armour that ran between the barbettes . The barbettes were 14 inches ( <unk> mm ) thick , but only 10 inches ( 254 mm ) behind the upper armour <unk> . The barbette <unk> were protected by 10 inches of armour on their face while their sides were 6 inches thick and the roof was 1 @.@ 5 inches ( 38 mm ) thick . <unk> bulkheads connecting the barbettes to the side armour were 12 – 14 inches thick , but only 6 inches thick at the lower deck level . The frontal armour of the casemates protecting the secondary armament was also 6 inches thick with the rear protected by 2 @-@ inch ( 51 mm ) armour plates . The flat portion of the deck armour was 2 @.@ 5 inches ( 64 mm ) thick and 4 inches ( 102 mm ) thick where it sloped down to the sides of the ship . The conning tower was protected by 14 inches of armour . 
 Asahi , like all the other Japanese battleships of the time , was fitted with four <unk> and Stroud <unk> coincidence rangefinders that had an effective range of 8 @,@ 000 yards ( 7 @,@ 300 m ) . The ships were also fitted with 24 @-@ power <unk> <unk> <unk> . 
 Asahi , meaning " rising sun " , a poetic name for Japan from a stanza of <unk> poetry , was laid down on 1 August 1898 in <unk> , Scotland , by the <unk> Engineering & Shipbuilding Co. and completed by John Brown & Company , which purchased the firm before Asahi was completed . She was launched on 13 March 1899 and completed on 31 July 1900 . Her completion was delayed by about three months when her bottom plating required repairs after running aground off <unk> following sea trials . The ship departed England , after repairs in Portsmouth , on the day of her completion , and arrived at <unk> , Japan , on 23 October 1900 . Asahi became flagship of the Standing Fleet on 22 May 1901 and was assigned to the 1st Battleship Division of the 1st Fleet when the Combined Fleet was re @-@ formed on 28 December 1903 . 
 At the start of the Russo @-@ Japanese War , Asahi , commanded by Captain <unk> <unk> , was assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Fleet . She participated in the Battle of Port Arthur on 9 February 1904 , when Vice Admiral <unk> <unk> led the 1st Fleet in an attack on the Russian ships of the Pacific Squadron anchored just outside Port Arthur . <unk> had expected the surprise night attack by his destroyers to be much more successful than it was , anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened , but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack . The Japanese ships were spotted by the protected cruiser <unk> , which was patrolling offshore and alerted the Russian defences . <unk> chose to attack the Russian coastal defences with his main armament and engage the ships with his secondary guns . <unk> his fire proved to be a poor decision as the Japanese eight @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) and six @-@ inch guns inflicted little damage on the Russian ships , which concentrated all their fire on the Japanese ships with some effect . Although many ships on both sides were hit , Russian casualties numbered only 17 , while the Japanese suffered 60 killed and wounded before <unk> <unk> . Asahi was not hit during the engagement . 
 The ship participated in the action of 13 April , when <unk> successfully lured out a portion of the Pacific Squadron , including Vice Admiral <unk> <unk> 's flagship , the battleship <unk> . When <unk> spotted the five battleships of the 1st Division , he turned back for Port Arthur and <unk> struck a minefield laid by the Japanese the previous night . The Russian battleship sank in less than two minutes after one of her magazines exploded , and <unk> was one of the <unk> killed . <unk> by his success , <unk> resumed long @-@ range bombardment missions , prompting the Russians to lay more minefields , which sank two Japanese battleships the following month . 
 Captain W. C. <unk> , the Royal Navy 's official military observer under the Anglo @-@ Japanese Alliance , took notes of the battle 's progress from a deck chair on Asahi 's exposed quarterdeck . His report confirmed the superiority of Japanese training and tactics and publicized the victory in the West . 
 In 1908 , Asahi was part of the Japanese fleet that escorted the American Great White Fleet through Japanese waters during its round @-@ the @-@ globe voyage . The ship was assigned to the 1st Fleet in 1908 and 1910 – 11 . Asahi became a gunnery training ship in 1914 , and was re @-@ armed in 1917 with Japanese guns replacing her original British @-@ made guns . The same year , she was assigned to the 5th Division of the 3rd Fleet . In 1918 , Asahi became flagship of her division and participated in the Japanese intervention in the Russian Civil War . She escorted troop convoys to the Russian Far East and was guard ship at <unk> from January to August 1918 . Asahi was reclassified as a first @-@ class coastal defence ship on 1 September 1921 , and began <unk> in 1922 at <unk> in compliance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty . She was reclassified as a training and submarine depot ship on 1 April 1923 and her <unk> was completed in July of that same year . Her displacement dropped to 11 @,@ <unk> long tons ( 11 @,@ 625 t ) with the loss of her armour and guns , and her speed was limited to 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) . 
 The navy decided to convert Asahi into a submarine salvage ship and she began the first stage of her conversion with the installation of specialized salvage equipment from February to August 1925 . From 1926 to October 1927 , the ship 's 25 Belleville boilers were replaced with four <unk> Type <unk> boilers at <unk> Naval Arsenal . One of her two funnels was also removed , and two large lifting frames were installed as part of the second stage of her conversion . The ship conducted experiments in submarine rescue using the old German submarine 0 @-@ 1 ( ex @-@ U @-@ 125 ) . In May 1928 , Asahi was fitted with a 62 @-@ foot @-@ 4 @-@ inch ( 19 m ) compressed @-@ air aircraft catapult on her forecastle and successfully launched an <unk> Type 15 seaplane . After repeated accidents , the catapult was replaced by one powered by gunpowder . On the completion of testing in 1928 , Asahi was placed in reserve . 
 <unk> as a repair ship on 16 August 1937 , Asahi was taken out of reserve in November , after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident that started the Second <unk> @-@ Japanese War , and was used as a transport to land troops in an amphibious landing at Hangzhou Bay . Afterwards she began conversion at <unk> , Japan , into a repair ship ; this was completed on 18 December 1938 . Asahi was fitted with a <unk> wooden main battery fore and aft to resemble an old battleship after her arrival in Shanghai on 29 December . In May 1939 she was modified to act as a torpedo depot ship and carried out patrols between 29 May and 7 November 1940 . She was transferred to <unk> Bay , French Indochina , on 15 November 1940 and later transported the 11th Base Unit from <unk> to <unk> Bay 19 November – 7 December 1941 . 
 From 13 March 1942 , Asahi was stationed at Singapore , and in April her crew performed repairs on the light cruiser <unk> , which had been torpedoed by the submarine USS <unk> off Christmas Island . <unk> Singapore for <unk> on 22 May , escorted by the <unk> CH @-@ 9 , Asahi was sighted by the submarine USS Salmon on the night of 25 / 26 May 1942 , 100 miles ( 160 km ) southeast of Cape <unk> , Indochina . Of Salmon 's four torpedoes , two hit the ship in her port central boiler room and aft spaces . At 01 : 03 , moments after being hit , Asahi sank at 10 ° 00 ′ N 110 ° 00 ′ E. Sixteen men were killed in the attack ; the ship 's captain and <unk> crewmen were rescued by CH @-@ 9 .

When I first signed on I had a contract for seven seasons , and this coming year is my seventh . I just thought it was time for my character to go " . <unk> initially called the producers and offered to appear in Carell 's last season , because he 's " a fan and wanted to commemorate Carell ’ s swan song " .

 " Training Day " received mixed reviews from television critics . IGN writer <unk> White wrote that <unk> was not given a proper introduction and that he wasn 't distinguished from Michael 's character . She also went on to criticize Jim , Pam and Dwight 's reaction to <unk> as the new manager , particular that of Jim and Pam , writing that " it 's becoming <unk> obvious that the longtime writers don 't know what to do with them anymore " .

She ultimately gave the episode a 7 @.@ 5 out of 10 rating , denoting a " good " episode . The A.V. Club reviewer Myles <unk> praised Michael 's reactions to the office easily ignoring him for <unk> , calling the final shot of him walking into his office alone " quite effective " , and that Dwight 's reaction to not being suggested to be Michael 's replacement made it more " meaningful " . Despite this , he continued by saying that the series was not " sophisticated " enough to use this plotline effectively and criticized the writing for the cast , which made them look " stupid " for " cheap humor " and a " enormously shallow laughter " . He ultimately gave the episode a " C + " . Alan Sepinwall , a columnist for HitFix , complimented the chemistry between <unk> and Carell , but criticized the storyline which eventually came down to Michael " being <unk> about not being the center of attention every minute of every day " , negatively comparing it to " <unk> Party " . Despite this , he noted that <unk> 's presence did involve several funny moments . 
 John <unk> <unk> <unk> ( August 5 , 1869 – January 9 , 1940 ) was the 35th Governor of Kentucky and a United States Senator from Kentucky . He was the state 's first popularly elected senator following passage of the Seventeenth Amendment . 
 <unk> from a prominent political family , <unk> was chosen as Democrat William <unk> 's running mate in the gubernatorial election of 1899 despite the fact that he was not yet of legal age to serve as governor if called to do so . <unk> lost the election to Republican William S. Taylor , but the Kentucky General Assembly disputed the election results . During the political wrangling that followed , an unknown assassin shot <unk> . A day later the General Assembly <unk> enough votes to give the election to <unk> , who was sworn into office on his deathbed . Taylor claimed the election had been stolen by the Democratic majority in the General Assembly and a legal fight ensued between him and <unk> over the governorship . <unk> ultimately prevailed and Taylor fled the state . 
 Following his term as governor , <unk> made a bid to become a U.S. Senator . His stance in favor of prohibition cost him the votes of four legislators in his own party and the seat went to Republican William O. Bradley . Six years later <unk> secured the seat by popular election , but he lost his re @-@ election bid largely because of his pro @-@ temperance views and his opposition to women 's suffrage . Though he continued to play an active role in state politics for another two decades , he never returned to elected office , failing in his gubernatorial bid in 1927 and his <unk> campaign in 1936 . He died in Louisville on January 9 , 1940 . 
 J. C. W. <unk> was born at <unk> , near <unk> in Nelson County , Kentucky , son of William <unk> and Julia <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> . His maternal grandfather , Charles A. <unk> , was governor of Kentucky from 1839 to 1840 and served as <unk> general in the administration of John Tyler . His uncle , Robert C. <unk> , served as governor of Louisiana . 
 <unk> obtained his early education at <unk> Academy in <unk> . In 1881 he served as a page in the Kentucky House of Representatives at the age of 12 . Later , he enrolled at Central University ( now Eastern Kentucky University ) in Richmond , Kentucky but was forced to quit school at the age of 17 to support his widowed mother . Two years later , he became principal of <unk> public schools , serving from 1888 to 1893 . <unk> , he studied law at the University of Kentucky , where he earned his law degree in 1889 . He was admitted to the bar , and commenced practice in <unk> in 1893 . He also served as president of the Young Democrats ' Club of Nelson County . 
 <unk> 's political career began in 1894 when he was elected without opposition to the Kentucky House of Representatives . He served four consecutive terms and was Speaker of the House in 1898 , his final year in the House . He also served as a delegate to every Democratic National Convention from 1900 to 1920 . 
 Democrat William <unk> chose <unk> as his running mate in the Kentucky gubernatorial election of 1899 . <unk> was hesitant about the selection because he wanted someone who could deliver the vote of his home county in the general election , and <unk> 's native Nelson County was already committed to a rival candidate . But friends of <unk> assured him that <unk> would be loyal to <unk> 's reform agenda , whereas the two other men <unk> was considering as running mates would " stack the Senate committees against him . " <unk> was not yet 30 , the minimum age to serve as governor , at the time of his selection . 
 <unk> lost a close election to Republican William S. Taylor . When the General Assembly 's session opened on January 2 , 1900 , the election results were immediately challenged . With Democrats in control of both houses of the Assembly , the results seemed sure to be reversed . The Assembly was still <unk> on January 30 , 1900 , when <unk> was shot by an unknown assailant as he entered the state capitol building . The following day , as <unk> was being treated for his wounds at a local hotel , the General Assembly <unk> enough votes to give him the election . He was sworn into office from his bed the same day . Three days later <unk> died , never having risen from the bed . 
 Legislative chaos ensued as Taylor refused to acknowledge the Assembly 's decision and <unk> the governorship . The Republicans in the legislature <unk> Taylor 's orders , while the Democrats ignored Taylor and followed the orders of their leadership . Finally , on February 21 , 1900 , Taylor and <unk> agreed to let the courts settle the matter . The case first went before the Louisville Circuit Court , which found in favor of <unk> . Republicans appealed to the Kentucky Court of Appeals , at that time the court of last resort in the state . On April 6 , 1900 , the Court of Appeals upheld the ruling of the lower court . Taylor appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States , which declined to hear the case on May 21 , 1900 . Taylor 's only supporter on the court was <unk> John Marshall <unk> . 
 Following the Supreme Court ruling , Taylor fled to Indianapolis , Indiana , fearing he would be implicated in <unk> 's assassination . <unk> became acting governor , but because of the unusual circumstances surrounding the election , a special election was held November 6 , 1900 , to determine who would complete <unk> 's <unk> term . <unk> ( now of age ) won the election over Republican John W. <unk> by fewer than 4 @,@ 000 votes . Shortly following the special election , <unk> married Jean Raphael <unk> of <unk> . The couple had two sons . 
 As governor <unk> sought to unite his party and the state . As part of this effort he supported changes to the <unk> partisan <unk> Election Law , authored by his late running mate while the latter was a member of the General Assembly . He stressed non @-@ controversial issues such as improvements to roads and the state 's educational system . He recommended passage of a law to set uniform school textbook prices , a reform both he and <unk> had advocated during the gubernatorial campaign . However , his passive leadership ensured that the General Assembly did little to address his agenda . The only major pieces of legislation passed during <unk> 's term were a tax increase that added a half million dollars to the state 's revenue and a child labor law that forbade children under 14 to work without their parents ' consent . 
 Although the Kentucky Constitution prohibited governors from serving consecutive terms , <unk> announced he would seek a full term as governor in 1903 . His candidacy was challenged in court , but the court ruled <unk> had not served a full first term and was eligible to run . Due to his record of reconciliation and supporting non @-@ controversial reforms , he had no significant opposition in winning his party 's nomination . His record also deprived his Republican opponent , Morris B. <unk> , of any significant campaign issue in the general election . <unk> defeated <unk> and three minor candidates . 
 In his message to the legislature in 1904 , <unk> again raised the issue of a uniform school textbook law , which had not passed during his first term . The law was one of few significant reforms that passed during the 1904 session . During the session funds were approved for building a new capitol building and a memorial to the late Governor <unk> . 
 In March 1904 , <unk> signed the Day Law <unk> racial segregation of all schools in Kentucky . <unk> College , a private college in eastern Kentucky that had been integrated since the 1850s , immediately filed suit to challenge the law . The substance of the law was upheld in the circuit court and the Kentucky Court of Appeals . <unk> appealed to the Supreme Court , and in 1908 the court handed down an 8 – 1 decision against the college . Only John Marshall <unk> <unk> . 
 Near the close of the 1904 session , legislators approved the creation of <unk> County from parts of Carter , Elliott , and Lewis counties . Olive Hill was made the county seat . Soon the county 's existence was challenged in court on grounds that it fell short of the 400 square miles ( 1 @,@ 000 km2 ) required by the state constitution and that it reduced the counties it was carved from to less than 400 square miles ( 1 @,@ 000 km2 ) . Carter County joined the lawsuit , claiming the border of <unk> County passed too close to Grayson , the seat of Carter County , and <unk> , the seat of Lewis County . The state constitution forbade county borders to pass within 10 miles ( 16 km ) of a county seat . On April 29 , 1904 , the Kentucky Court of Appeals found in favor of the <unk> and dissolved <unk> County . 
 During the 1906 legislative session , <unk> urged investigation and prosecution of corrupt insurance companies , following the lead of New York attorney Charles Evans Hughes . In particular , he recommended reducing the practice of deferred <unk> , which allowed the insurance companies to keep large stores of cash on @-@ hand for illegal purposes . He further advocated that insurance companies doing business in the state be required to invest a certain percentage of their earnings in Kentucky , <unk> the its economy and providing <unk> some protection against fraud . 
 <unk> refused to send troops into the western part of the state to quell the ongoing Black <unk> Tobacco Wars . He cited constitutional reasons for his refusal , but more probably his reasons were political – the Democrats were dominant in this region and he didn 't want to challenge his own party . By collecting some old Civil War debts from the federal government , <unk> virtually eliminated the state 's debt . Encouraged by the state 's improved finances , the General Assembly voted to expand two of the state 's normal schools , Western State Teachers College in <unk> Green ( later Western Kentucky University ) and Eastern State Teachers College in Richmond ( later part of Eastern Kentucky University ) . 
 <unk> 's term as governor ended December 10 , 1907 . In January 1908 he faced the legislature as the Democratic nominee for a seat in the U.S. Senate by virtue of the primary held two years earlier . The Republicans nominated former governor William O. Bradley . On the first ballot <unk> secured 66 of the needed 69 votes ; Bradley received 64 votes . Seven Democrats had not voted for <unk> . Over the next six weeks , 25 more votes were taken with neither man securing a majority , even though William Jennings Bryan , the Democratic nominee for president , campaigned for <unk> . Some Democrats pressured <unk> to withdraw and allow a more palatable Democrat to run , but he refused . On the 29th ballot , taken near the end of February 1908 , Bradley finally secured a majority after four Democrats crossed party lines to vote for him . 
 Six years later <unk> again attempted to win the Senate seat . Due to the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment , the senator would not be elected by the legislature , but by popular vote . In the Democratic primary <unk> defeated Augustus O. Stanley , a 12 @-@ year veteran congressman . The Republican nominee was former governor Augustus E. <unk> . <unk> by his support of President <unk> Wilson , <unk> won the election by 32 @,@ 000 votes . 
 <unk> served as chairman of the Senate Committee on <unk> in the Department of Labor from 1915 to 1917 and on the Senate Committee on Military Affairs . In the latter position he was influential in securing two large military training posts for Kentucky , Camp Zachary Taylor and Fort Knox . Though Camp Zachary Taylor was abandoned after World War I , Fort Knox became the home of the United States <unk> <unk> . When the United States entered World War I , <unk> continued to back President Wilson and supported the League of Nations . 
 True to his <unk> stance , <unk> supported passage of the <unk> Amendment <unk> the import and sale of alcohol in the United States . The amendment was ratified and became effective in January 1920 . Believing women should be protected from involvement in politics , <unk> opposed the <unk> Amendment , which granted women 's suffrage . The amendment failed on February 10 , 1919 , but passed on June 4 , 1919 . <unk> voted against it both times . 
 The Democrats <unk> <unk> without opposition in 1920 . His opponent in the general election was Republican Richard P. Ernst . Prohibition had destroyed the <unk> industry and the saloon business in the state , and in areas where these industries were prominent <unk> received more than 5 @,@ 000 fewer votes than Democratic presidential nominee James M. Cox . He was also hurt by the women 's vote and by his support of President Wilson , who had lost popularity since <unk> 's election in 1914 . Ernst won the election by fewer than 5 @,@ 000 votes , winning the race with 50 @.@ 3 percent of the vote to <unk> 's 49 @.@ 7 percent . During his single term in the Senate <unk> served alongside three other U.S. Senators from Kentucky : <unk> M. James , George B. Martin and Augustus O. Stanley . 
 Following his term in the Senate , <unk> resumed his legal practice in Louisville . He sought another term as governor in 1927 . This time he had the support of the Louisville Courier @-@ Journal , which had been purchased by his ally , Robert W. <unk> . He was opposed by a powerful political machine known as the <unk> Club , whose main interest was securing legislation to allow <unk> betting at the state 's horse <unk> . 
 The <unk> Club ran a candidate in both parties ' primary elections . In the Democratic primary <unk> defeated the Club 's relatively obscure candidate , Robert T. Crowe . <unk> D. Sampson , the Club 's nominee in the Republican primary , won his party 's nomination . In the general election <unk> could not secure the support of Democratic governor William J. Fields , who had been elected with the help of the <unk> Club . Despite the Democrats winning every other contest on the ballot , including the race for lieutenant governor , <unk> lost to Sampson by more than 32 @,@ 000 votes . It was estimated that the Club spent over $ 500 @,@ 000 to defeat him . 
 <unk> was expected to be the Democrats ' nominee for governor in 1935 , but the death of his son in late 1934 left him distraught and his wife opposed to another campaign . The Democrats turned to A. B. " Happy " Chandler of Henderson , who won the election . <unk> supported Chandler 's bid , and in return Chandler appointed him to the Kentucky Public Service Commission in 1936 . <unk> also served on the Department of Business Regulations Commission and chaired the State Government <unk> Commission . 
 <unk> attempted to return to the Senate in 1936 . The head of the <unk> Club , James B. Brown , had lost his fortune and influence when his banking empire crashed in 1930 . In 1933 <unk> 's ally , Robert <unk> , had been appointed ambassador to the Court of St. James 's , increasing his prominence and influence . <unk> also enjoyed the support of the United Mine Workers and Louisville mayor Neville Miller . The race was complicated , though , by the entry of John <unk> Brown , a Democrat who was a U.S. Representative and former Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives . He had agreed to support Chandler 's bid for the governorship in exchange for Chandler 's support in his run for the Senate . However , Chandler threw his support to <unk> , and while Brown was not able to win the seat without the support of <unk> and Chandler , he did garner 85 @,@ 000 votes , most of them at <unk> 's expense . Democratic incumbent M. M. Logan retained the seat by 2 @,@ 385 votes . 
 <unk> died in Louisville on January 9 , 1940 , and was buried in Frankfort Cemetery in Frankfort , Kentucky . <unk> County , Oklahoma , was named in his honor at the suggestion of a <unk> who was serving as a delegate to Oklahoma 's constitutional convention in 1907 . <unk> , his birthplace , was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 16 , 1973 . 
 The 1888 – 89 New Zealand Native football team was a New Zealand rugby union team that toured Britain , Ireland , Australia and New Zealand in 1888 and 1889 . It mostly comprised players of Māori ancestry , and also included some <unk> ( white New Zealanders ) . A wholly private <unk> , the tour was not under the auspices of any official rugby authority ; it was organised by New Zealand international player Joseph <unk> , promoted by civil servant Thomas <unk> , and managed by James Scott , a <unk> . The <unk> were the first New Zealand team to perform a <unk> , and also the first to wear all black . They played 107 rugby matches during the tour , as well as a small number of Victorian Rules football and association football matches in Australia . Having made a significant impact on the development of New Zealand rugby , the <unk> were inducted into the International Rugby Board Hall of Fame in 2008 . 
 After a preliminary tour of New Zealand in 1888 , the side travelled to England via Melbourne and Suez . The Māori players initially provoked curiosity due to their race , but the British press subsequently expressed some surprise that the side was not as " Māori " as they had expected . Playing their first match , on 3 October against Surrey , the team was subjected to a taxing match schedule , and frequently played three matches per week . Their early matches included a 9 – 0 loss to Middlesex , but their form improved in November , when they won 10 of their 13 matches . The team played its first international match on 1 December , against Ireland , and won 13 – 4 . This was followed by a win over one of the strongest English county teams , Yorkshire , and a 5 – 0 defeat against the Wales national team . By January 1889 the <unk> had played 36 matches in less than three months , winning 22 of them ; they had spent most of their time in the north of England , where the playing strength was strongest and the crowds largest and most profitable . 
 In a return match on 19 January , Yorkshire fielded a stronger side than in the first match and inflicted one of the <unk> ' heaviest losses , a 16 – 4 defeat . The team then went undefeated until 16 February , when they faced England . Officials of the strictly amateur Rugby Football Union ( RFU ) had become increasingly concerned at the behaviour of the New Zealanders , regarding them as unsportsmanlike , and tensions reached a nadir in the aftermath of the England international , during which the RFU secretary George Rowland Hill , <unk> the game , awarded a number of controversial tries to England , prompting three of the <unk> to temporarily leave the field in protest ; England eventually won 7 – 0 . The <unk> apologised afterwards for their behaviour , but the damage was not repaired . The New Zealanders left England without an official send @-@ off , and travelled to Australia where they toured Victoria , New South Wales and Queensland . They then returned to New Zealand , where they displayed a level of combination not seen in their home country before . They went 31 games undefeated before losing their final match , on 24 August 1889 , 7 – 2 to Auckland . 
 The <unk> ' final record in rugby matches was 78 wins , 6 draws and 23 losses . They introduced a number of tactical innovations to New Zealand rugby on their return home , and their tour contributed to the formation of the New Zealand Rugby Football Union in 1892 . Seventeen of the team 's 26 players went on to play <unk> in New Zealand , and two , Thomas <unk> and David <unk> , subsequently captained the New Zealand national rugby team . 
 The idea for assembling a team of Māori footballers to tour Britain was conceived by Joseph <unk> , a rugby player who had toured with the first New Zealand national team in 1884 . He initially proposed a team of Māori or part @-@ Māori to play the touring British side in 1888 ; this developed into a venture to have a Māori team tour Britain if a preliminary tour of New Zealand were successful . <unk> of <unk> 's plans , civil servant Thomas <unk> contacted him to offer help managing the tour , which <unk> accepted . When James Scott , a <unk> , subsequently joined the partnership , the three men decided that <unk> would be the team 's captain , Scott its manager and <unk> its promoter . 
 <unk> started assembling a team for the tour in early 1888 . He had difficulties assembling a squad due to player availability , and failed to secure the talented Jack <unk> due to his university commitments . Some Māori players who initially agreed to play later pulled out when the eligibility criteria were relaxed to allow squad members who were only part @-@ Māori . Twenty Māori or part @-@ Māori players joined the squad ; five <unk> ( white New Zealand ) players were added after the team lost to Auckland . Due to the inclusion of these <unk> players the team was renamed from the " New Zealand <unk> " to the " New Zealand Native Football Representatives " . The final squad comprised 26 players ( including <unk> ) ; of these at least five were full @-@ <unk> Māori , while fourteen had a Māori mother and a <unk> father . The parentage of some of the players is unknown . 
 The team toured New Zealand before departing overseas , playing against <unk> 's Bay , Auckland , Nelson , Wellington , Canterbury , South Canterbury , and <unk> . The first game was contested against <unk> 's Bay in Napier on 23 June 1888 . They played nine games in their preliminary tour of New Zealand , and won seven of them . Their last New Zealand match before departure , against <unk> played in <unk> on 31 July 1888 , was won by one try to nil . 
 The team sailed for Australia from <unk> , leaving on 1 August 1888 . In Melbourne , Scott recruited Jack <unk> to train the players in Victorian Rules football in Britain as preparation for possible Victorian Rules matches on their return to Australia . The team played two rugby matches against the Melbourne Rugby Union team , winning the first and drawing the second , before continuing to Britain via Suez . They arrived in London on 27 September 1888 . 
 The team were met in Britain by local rugby administrators , including an official of England 's Rugby Football Union ( RFU ) . The first match of the tour was against Surrey , where the team became the first New Zealand side to perform a <unk> , and also the first to wear an all black uniform . That the team was predominantly Māori provoked curiosity from the British press – at the time , most Britons had not seen non @-@ white people – but there was some surprise that the team were not as " Māori " as had been expected . " They are not unlike Europeans , " a Scottish reporter wrote in November 1888 ; " that is their resemblance is great when one remembers that they were a savage tribe no further back than a generation " . The Surrey match , which was <unk> by the RFU secretary George Rowland Hill , was won 4 – 1 by the <unk> after they scored two tries . 
 The <unk> next defeated both <unk> and Kent , before defeats by <unk> and Burton @-@ on @-@ Trent . Both defeats were unexpected , and in the <unk> match , injuries played a part – the tourists played most of the match at least two men down , as replacements were then not allowed . The team recovered to win their next game , against Midlands Counties in Birmingham . Their next fixture was against Middlesex in a match not open to the public , and hosted by the Earl of Sheffield at Sheffield Park , <unk> . The Middlesex side contained a number of international players , including Arthur Gould . Middlesex won easily , with the <unk> play characterised by poor tackling . The final score was 9 – 0 , with three tries conceded by the New Zealanders . Prior to the match both sides had enjoyed lunch with wine – an indulgence the <unk> were not used to . A report in the Auckland Star had this to say of the game : 
 The New Zealanders expected to meet a mere exhibition 15 of scratch players , whereas Mr Rowland Hill had carefully collected the best possible team available . Such " passing " as the Home men displayed the <unk> <unk> admit they have never previously witnessed . Said <unk> whilst we were on the platform waiting for the London train , " I think they would have just beaten us , even if we had been in good form . " 
 Following the match against Middlesex , the team travelled to the north , where the strongest English rugby teams were based . Yorkshire and Lancashire dominated the county championship until many of their respective member clubs split from the RFU in 1895 over the issue of " broken time " payments . The New Zealanders lost to Hull 1 – 0 , defeated <unk> , then lost to Wakefield . After their first draw of the tour ( against Northumberland County ) they defeated Stockton @-@ on @-@ <unk> and <unk> . Joe <unk> appeared in the match against <unk> , but aggravated the foot injury that had kept him out of the side until that point . These victories were followed by a 13 – 4 defeat to Halifax on 10 November . The team then won seven matches in a row , including one against <unk> RFC , their only Scottish opposition of the tour . The last two matches that month were a loss to <unk> and a 9 – 0 victory over Liverpool and District . The team had played thirteen fixtures during November and won ten of them . By this point , the team was beset by injuries – of the fifteen players that played against <unk> County on 24 November , five had injuries . The squad comprised only 26 players , and the tourists were often struggling to field a side . Nevertheless , their heavy schedule continued ; on 30 November 1888 they left for Dublin , where a match had been organised against the Ireland national team . 
 The Ireland fixture was played at Lansdowne Road , Dublin , on 1 December 1888 . Both teams had a number of leading players out injured – the Irish were forced to make four changes to their original selection . Ireland led 3 – 0 at half @-@ time after scoring a converted try , but the <unk> improved considerably in the second @-@ half , scoring four tries . Patrick <unk> scored the first two tries , and his play was praised by the local press . The third try scored was by Thomas <unk> after a counter @-@ attack by George Williams . The try was not converted , but the strong finish from the New Zealanders gave the visitors a 13 – 4 victory . The Irish press were surprised by the loss and strongly criticised their team , but Ireland did go on to defeat Wales two tries to nil in the 1889 Home Nations Championship . Following their defeat of Ireland , the <unk> played Trinity College and then North of Ireland . The match against Trinity College was drawn 4 – 4 , and despite <unk> not playing , the Native side played much better than their previous fixture . The team then travelled to Belfast , where they defeated North of Ireland 2 – 0 on 5 December ; scoring two tries to nil . 
 After returning to England , the <unk> faced Lancashire in Manchester , where they lost 1 – 0 . Two days later they drew with <unk> Bulldogs , despite their opposition scoring five tries . Their next match was against Yorkshire , who were one of the strongest counties in the country , and went on to win the inaugural County Championship that season . Yorkshire fielded a weakened team , and were subsequently defeated 10 – 6 by the <unk> , who scored six tries . After a further two victories , the team travelled to Wales , where they lost 3 – 0 to <unk> , before facing Wales on 22 December . 
 At the start of the match the home crowd were fairly hostile towards the Welsh team due to fans of both Swansea and <unk> feeling slighted by the lack of selection of their players . Four teams dominated Welsh international selection at the time , and out of the 15 @-@ man team only William Towers and William Bowen of Swansea and Dan <unk> of <unk> had been selected . The match was played in Swansea , and the lack of local players may have contributed to a poor crowd , with gate receipts of only £ 120 recorded . The crowd 's hostility impacted on the players , and <unk> Norman <unk> was " <unk> nervous " at the start of the match . <unk> , aged 18 years and 49 days , became the youngest Welsh international player – a record he held until the debut of Tom <unk> in 2010 . Despite the <unk> aimed primarily at <unk> , Charlie Arthur and George Thomas , the Welsh team produced an excellent effort , especially from the forwards . 
 The match was also of historical importance because of the Welsh tactics employed . In the 1886 Home Nations Championship Wales had <unk> the four three @-@ quarter system , wherein the team would play with eight forwards rather than nine , and instead employ an extra centre three @-@ quarter . The system was deemed a failure and was particularly unpopular with star Welsh player Arthur Gould , whose formidable ability as a back allowed his club team Newport to retain the additional forward . With Gould working in the West Indies , Wales again tried the four three @-@ quarter system against the <unk> , and its success saw the team permanently adopt the system . Within six years the other three Home Countries had adopted four three @-@ quarter style of play . 
 Before they left Wales , the <unk> played Swansea and two other local clubs , Newport , and Cardiff . They defeated Swansea for their first win in Wales , and followed this up with a victory over Newport in front of 8 @,@ 000 spectators . They finished their Welsh matches , and the year , with a 4 – 1 loss to Cardiff in front of a partisan crowd . 
 The side entered 1889 having played 36 matches for 22 wins and three draws . The <unk> ' play had improved throughout November and December following poorer form in their October matches ; positive press reports reflected this improvement . The team would go on to play a further 17 matches before their 16 February international against England . January started with a 4 – 1 loss to Bradford , during which 25 police officers were required to keep many of the 12 @,@ 000 spectators , many of them non @-@ paying , in order . This was followed by victories over Leeds Parish Church , <unk> , <unk> Rangers , and Huddersfield . Following further matches against <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , where the team drew , lost , then won , the side faced Yorkshire for a second time . 
 After a victory over <unk> Valley District , the team travelled west to play <unk> , Devonshire , Taunton , and Gloucestershire , and won all five games . The victory over Somerset was the New Zealanders ' largest of the tour ; they scored nine tries in a 17 – 4 victory . Half @-@ back <unk> played outstandingly for the <unk> , while the entire side demonstrated superior passing and combination to their opposition . Devonshire and <unk> suffered heavy defeats by the New Zealanders , before a strong Gloucestershire side was dismissed . After defeating Midland Counties , the <unk> returned to London . 
 The team had two further matches before their international against England . The first was against one of the strongest clubs in England , <unk> . Andrew <unk> , who had toured New Zealand and Australia with the 1888 British Isles side , played for the club in their 9 – 3 defeat to the <unk> . The New Zealanders won having scored four tries , including two by <unk> . Their next opposition was a United Services side mainly comprising Royal Navy players . The <unk> were again victorious , this time 10 – 0 . The match against Oxford University was postponed due to heavy <unk> , and so the team had a seven @-@ day break from playing – their longest of the tour . 
 The match against England was causing the <unk> ' players and management problems before it had even begun . The team manager , Scott , was in dispute with the RFU over where the match should be played – the RFU were adamant that the match should take place at <unk> 's ground , but Scott wanted the game to proceed at The Oval , where a larger crowd , and therefore higher gate receipts , could be secured . The strictly amateur RFU establishment were already suspicious of the profit @-@ making motives of the <unk> , and were unwilling to yield on the selection of venue . The RFU was also in dispute with the other Home <unk> over the formation of the International Rugby Football Board ( <unk> ) . Following a disputed try in an England – Scotland international match in 1888 , the Scottish authorities had pushed for the establishment of an international body to oversee the game , but the RFU insisted that they would only join if they held a deciding vote , arguing that they deserved this as they were , they asserted , the senior body , and had the most member clubs . Ireland , Wales and Scotland consequently refused to play against England until 1891 , when , following arbitration , the RFU relented and joined the <unk> . The absence of international matches was a factor in England agreeing to face the <unk> on 16 February 1889 . 
 The line @-@ ups selected for the 16 February match were both strong , and close to full strength . Though 12 of the England side had not played internationally before , all were experienced at domestic level . The match was <unk> by Rowland Hill , who had also <unk> the <unk> ' first match in Britain , against Surrey . The opening of the first half was a scoreless affair , with much tackling and <unk> on the heavy ground . Later in the half England scored two tries through Harry Bedford , but both were disputed by the <unk> , who claimed that one of their players had grounded the ball in @-@ goal . England took the two @-@ try advantage into the second half . 
 The RFU , at Hill 's instigation , promptly demanded an apology from the <unk> ' captain of the day , Edward <unk> , who had led the team as Joe <unk> was injured . The English authorities of the time believed that the decision of a referee was above question , and that protesting a decision as the New Zealanders had done was unsportsmanlike . The RFU threatened to bar any of their affiliated players – in other words , the entire rugby playing population of England – from facing the <unk> if they did not <unk> . <unk> swiftly sent an apology by telegram , but this was deemed inadequate ; he therefore sent another , four days after the game : 
 The London establishment that governed the game were disturbed by the New Zealanders ' approach to the game ; reports of rough and over @-@ aggressive play by the <unk> had steadily increased in frequency since their arrival in Britain . In the north of England , criticism of the visitors ' <unk> was rarer ; the tourists were accepted as playing the game in the same spirit as their local opponents , which in the north was a more working class sport than in the south . Some of the <unk> , including Joe <unk> , accused the RFU and the English press of hypocrisy , claiming that they were quick to <unk> the New Zealanders for rough play , yet tolerant of similar behaviour from their own players . 
 The <unk> remained in London following the England international . They defeated London Welsh on 18 February , before losing first to Cambridge , then Oxford University . From there they travelled north and won two matches before losing to Leigh . After a win over <unk> , there was a defeat to Oldham , played on a ground <unk> said was so frozen it was dangerous . After reversing their previous loss to Halifax with a 6 – 0 win , the <unk> suffered a loss to Barrow and District on 7 March . The New Zealanders then had a run of seven straight wins before a 1 – 1 draw with Hull . <unk> were then defeated for the second time in two weeks in the tourists ' last match in northern England . 
 The team struggled to find an opponent for their final match in Britain . They eventually played Southern Counties , and beat them 3 – 1 . This was their <unk> match in the British Isles and their 49th victory . The authorities and press in London continued to view the team negatively , and the <unk> boarded ship without a formal farewell . This perceived <unk> from the RFU provoked some criticism from the press outside London , as well as from the team manager Scott , who felt that with the team 's official apology after the England match , the controversy should have put to rest . 
 The majority of the <unk> left Plymouth on 29 March ( <unk> and Pie <unk> followed a week later ) . They arrived in Melbourne in May , where the team played mostly Victorian Rules football , hoping to make more money that way . Although the side had employed Jack <unk> to coach them in Victorian Rules during their tour of the British Isles , the heavy schedule and high injury count had left little time and energy for such training . As a result , the Victorian Rules matches were a failure ; the players ' <unk> with the rules , combined with the fact that most of the <unk> were rugby forwards ( and therefore less suited to the more open Victorian Rules ) , ensured that they failed to perform well on the field and struggled to attract large crowds . The side played nine Victorian Rules matches in total , including one in New South Wales , but won only three of them , all against relatively weak opposition . 
 The side 's success in their rugby matches contrasted to their failure in Victorian Rules – the New Zealanders played three rugby matches while in Victoria : against Melbourne , a Navy selection , and Victoria . The matches were all won , with their game against Victoria a 19 – 0 victory . After this they left for Sydney for further rugby matches , and defeated New South Wales 12 – 9 . After two further victories , the side again faced New South Wales , and won the match 16 – 12 . Another two victories followed , before the team played their only association football matches of the tour – both defeats . 
 The team travelled north to Queensland , where , as in New South Wales , rugby was the dominant code of football . Consequently , the team exclusively played rugby while in the region . The <unk> faced Queensland at the Association Ground in Brisbane . The 8000 spectators witnessed the New Zealanders overwhelm the <unk> to win 22 – 0 ; the <unk> did not exert themselves in the win , and the score did not reflect their dominance . After a further two matches , against <unk> and Ipswich ( both of whom were comfortably defeated ) , the team returned to Brisbane for a rematch with Queensland . In contrast to their first meeting , the first @-@ half was a close affair , and the two sides were tied at the conclusion of the half . Billy <unk> suffered a kick to the head , and had to retire early in the second @-@ half . Following the loss of <unk> , the play of the <unk> improved and they recovered to win 11 – 7 . Not long after the game concluded rumours circulated that some of the players had been offered ₤ 50 by <unk> to throw the game . <unk> later said : 
 It was on the occasion of this match that four of our players were thought , in racing <unk> , to be playing " stiff " , and that they had been got by some <unk> ; at all events , when accused of it at half @-@ time and cautioned , they played a different game in the second half . 
 The response from the team 's management was to suspend four players . The team travelled to <unk> , where they defeated the locals 19 – 0 . The <unk> included a replacement player for only the second time , Charles <unk> , after the <unk> reduced the playing strength of the side . The team then travelled back to New Zealand , and arrived in <unk> on 5 August . 
 Two days after their return , the <unk> faced <unk> , who they defeated 5 – 1 in front of a crowd of 2 @,@ 000 . The side suffered further injury , to Harry Lee , and recruited <unk> W. <unk> for their match against <unk> District on 8 August . Despite playing the match two players down , the <unk> comfortably defeated <unk> 16 – 3 . Following the side 's return to New Zealand , the <unk> Rugby Football Union demanded that the team 's management explain the accusations levelled at them in Queensland . <unk> responded by insisting that the players had only been suspended while an investigation was conducted , and that the management was confident no wrongdoing had occurred . The Northern Rugby Union ( since renamed Queensland Rugby Union ) summarised the incident and aftermath in the 1889 Queensland Rugby Union Annual : 
 ... it was apparent to a judge of the game that something was wrong with the <unk> , as they were not showing their usual dash and combination . Four members of the team were suspended , a charge being made against them of attempting the sell the match . The matter was bought before the <unk> Union , who passed the following resolution : That , having heard all available evidence regarding the charges against certain members of the Native Team , and having received an explicit denial of charges from the accused members and a satisfactory explanation from the management , we are of opinion that there are no facts before us <unk> the allegations ... 
 The side left <unk> and travelled north where they played <unk> in Masterton . The match was won 10 – 8 , and the next day they faced Wellington , who they also defeated . The fixture against Wellington was nearly abandoned because Scott and the Wellington Rugby Union could not agree on a venue ; the match went ahead only when the Wellington officials agreed to cede the <unk> all profit from the match . After this the <unk> travelled to Auckland where they played their last match , against the province on 24 August . The match was lost 7 – 2 after each team scored two tries each , but the <unk> kicked a drop @-@ goal and a conversion . The loss ended a remarkable run of matches – the <unk> had a 31 @-@ game unbeaten streak in rugby matches that started with their victory over <unk> on 9 March ; the side won 30 , and drew one match between the defeats . 
 The tour had a significant impact on the development of rugby within New Zealand . It was the first tour of the British Isles by a team from the Southern Hemisphere , and the longest in the history of the sport . By the time the <unk> returned to New Zealand , they had developed into a side superior to any in the country , and introduced a number of tactical innovations . Seventeen of the 26 players went on to play <unk> in New Zealand , and two , <unk> and David <unk> , subsequently captained New Zealand . 
 The tour also prompted the eventual formation of the New Zealand Rugby Football Union ( <unk> , later renamed New Zealand Rugby Union ) in 1892 ; one reason for its formation was to ensure greater control over any future touring New Zealand sides . The <unk> sent an officially sanctioned New Zealand team , captained by <unk> , to tour Australia in 1893 . The <unk> are also the <unk> of the Māori All Blacks , a representative team organised by the <unk> , that first played in 1910 . The Native team , along with Joe <unk> , was inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame in 2008 – the seventh <unk> . 
 The squad consisted of 26 players . The exact names of several of the players is unknown . The number of matches played is a minimum number only – the line @-@ ups for a number of matches in Britain and Australia are either incomplete or unknown . 
 Wales : Jim Webb ( Newport ) , George Thomas ( Newport ) , <unk> Garrett ( Penarth ) , Charlie Arthur ( Cardiff ) , Norman <unk> ( Cardiff ) , Charlie Thomas ( Newport ) , William <unk> ( Cardiff ) , Frank Hill ( Cardiff ) <unk> . , Alexander <unk> ( Cardiff ) , Sydney Nicholls ( Cardiff ) , Jim <unk> ( Newport ) , <unk> Harding ( Newport ) , William Towers ( Swansea ) , William Bowen ( Swansea ) , Dan <unk> , ( <unk> ) 
 <unk> <unk> ( September 20 , 1885 – December 20 , 1958 ) was a Canadian @-@ American <unk> @-@ soprano and voice teacher . She performed and popularised songs by contemporary composers throughout her career and sang in the American premieres of several works by Erik <unk> , Maurice Ravel and Igor Stravinsky , including the title role in the latter 's <unk> . 
 The niece of Lady <unk> and Sir Wilfrid <unk> , who also were her patrons , she initially trained and performed in Europe . She then travelled to Java and for four years immersed herself in its native music , which she introduced to North American audiences on her return . She retired from performing in 1937 , and opened a voice studio in New York , where she became a founding member of the American Guild of Musical Artists and served on its board of governors . <unk> was praised for the many qualities her singing brought to music . The citation from the <unk> Society of San Francisco , which she received in 1949 , said : " ... her rare open @-@ mindedness and unorthodox enthusiasm having been initially responsible for the recognition of many vital and important modern composers " 
 Born in Ottawa , Ontario , <unk> received musical lessons as a child , in harmony , voice , and piano . The custom of the time dictated that North American musicians travel to Europe for training if they desired a <unk> professional career , and in July 1902 , at the age of seventeen , <unk> set out for Europe , financed by her aunt and uncle , Lady <unk> <unk> and Sir Wilfrid <unk> . 
 <unk> travelled to France , where she received private voice lessons from Auguste @-@ Jean <unk> of the Paris <unk> . <unk> on her vocal <unk> were problematic , but they were removed <unk> . She later began training under Jacques <unk> , whom she would later credit for her vocal technique . In 1906 , <unk> was retained by fellow Canadian singer Emma Albani to accompany her on a tour of England and her Canadian farewell tour . Albani provided a degree of <unk> to <unk> during the 30 week tour of Canada . 
 <unk> travelled to Paris in 1920 at the behest of the Music League of America . <unk> there to arrange a tour of North America by Maurice Ravel , she struck up a friendship and professional correspondence not only with him , but also with Erik <unk> and Les six . This led to more music being sent to her by various composers that she would premiere in concert . She accepted and premiered almost all works sent to her , the only exception being a refusal to perform <unk> <unk> by Arnold <unk> . Through this , <unk> performed large amounts of contemporary French music across the United States . She also included American music in all of her concerts . <unk> toured America frequently and returned to Europe in 1922 , and again in 1923 . She began to explore Jazz music in concert as well , earning her negative reviews by many musical critics . 
 <unk> continued to present music that was thought poorly of by conservative audiences . On some occasions , such as her performances of <unk> in New York in 1923 and 1925 , as well as in London in 1925 , this was quite successful . A critic in Vienna welcomed her musical selection as a <unk> from the usual fare of classical performances - Schubert , <unk> , Wolf , Richard <unk> - while praising her skill with more classical choices . Other performances suffered – she was <unk> while performing works by <unk> Villa @-@ <unk> at the Festival of the International Society of Contemporary Music in Venice . She became a celebrity , and continued giving performances across the United States , Europe , and her native Canada . On the <unk> anniversary of Canadian Confederation in 1927 , she gave a performance in Ottawa which was the first <unk> radio broadcast in Canada . Although she toured Canada from time to time , and attended performances of Canadian music in New York , she held a negative opinion of Canada 's treatment of native musicians , saying " Canadians . . . would rather listen to foreigners than their own people . " 
 Illness forced <unk> to halt giving performances in the late 1920s , but she would return to the stage in 1931 , giving a concert in Havana , Cuba . As time passed she began to engage more and more in teaching , and less and less in stage performing . Her income from teaching was substantially better than from touring . She retired from performing entirely in 1937 , and opened a music studio in New York . There she became a founding member of the American Guild of Musical Artists , serving on its board of governors . She died on December 20 , 1958 . 
 <unk> was a controversial musician in her time . Her choice of music for performance was often condemned , and often praised . The <unk> of jazz music for a <unk> trained singer , combined with the performances taking place in concert halls lead some critics to <unk> her for promoting otherwise overlooked music , and others to <unk> her for taking <unk> music into a <unk> venue . 
 A May 1 , 1917 review by the New York Times praised her natural talent , with some reservations about the <unk> quality of her voice . Her ability to capture the spirit of the pieces was also praised : " ... her singing of songs by Frenchmen of today and the day before yesterday gave pleasure because of her understanding of them and the appropriate expression which she found for them . " 
 A November 12 , 1923 Time review of her performance of historic Italian songs , as well as modern English , French , Austrian , German and American numbers focused on her choice to include selections of contemporary jazz music . The critic remarked " Her voice was much too good for jazz . " Here she was praised as a serious , scholarly artist whose performance was " ... <unk> and expressive . " The audience received the concert very enthusiastically . 
 The Battle of Sullivan 's Island or the Battle of Fort Sullivan was fought on June 28 , 1776 , during the American Revolutionary War . It took place near Charleston , South Carolina , during the first British attempt to capture the city from American rebels . It is also sometimes referred to as the First Siege of Charleston , owing to a more successful British siege in <unk> . 
 The British organized an expedition in early 1776 for operations in the rebellious southern colonies of North America . <unk> by logistical concerns and bad weather , the expedition reached the coast of North Carolina in May 1776 . Finding conditions unsuitable for their operations , General Henry Clinton and Admiral Sir Peter Parker decided instead to act against Charleston . Arriving there in early June , troops were landed on Long Island , near Sullivan 's Island where Colonel William <unk> commanded a partially constructed fort , in preparation for a naval bombardment and land assault . General Charles Lee , commanding the southern Continental theater of the war , would provide supervision . 
 The land assault was frustrated when the channel between the two islands was found to be too deep to <unk> , and the American defenses prevented an amphibious landing . The naval bombardment had little effect due to the sandy soil and the <unk> nature of the fort 's <unk> log construction . <unk> fire by the defenders wrought significant damage on the British fleet , which withdrew after an entire day 's bombardment . The British withdrew their expedition force to New York , and did not return to South Carolina until <unk> . 
 When the American Revolutionary War broke out in 1775 , the city of Charleston in the colony of South Carolina was a center of commerce in southern North America . The city 's citizens joined other colonists in opposing the British parliament 's attempts to tax them , and militia recruitment increased when word arrived of the April 1775 Battles of Lexington and Concord . Throughout 1775 and into 1776 , militia recruits arrived in the city from the colony 's <unk> , the city 's manufacturers and tradesmen began producing war materiel , and defensive fortifications began to take shape around the city . 
 British army forces in North America were primarily tied up with the Siege of Boston in 1775 . <unk> bases of operations where they had more control , the British planned an expedition to the southern colonies . Major General Henry Clinton , then in Boston , was to travel to Cape Fear , North Carolina , where he would join with largely Scottish <unk> raised in the North Carolina <unk> , and a force of 2 @,@ 000 men from Ireland under the command of Major General Charles Cornwallis . 
 The plan was beset by difficulties from the start . The Irish expedition , originally supposed to depart at the beginning of December 1775 , was delayed by logistical difficulties , and its 2 @,@ 500 troops did not depart until February 13 , 1776 , escorted by 11 warships under the command of Admiral Sir Peter Parker . Clinton left Boston on January 20 with two companies of light infantry , and first stopped at New York City to confer with William Tryon , New York 's royal governor . Major General Charles Lee , sent by Major General George Washington to see to the defense of New York , <unk> arrived there the same day as Clinton . New York was at that time extremely tense ; <unk> forces were beginning to <unk> and evict <unk> , and the British fleet anchored there was having difficulty acquiring provisions . Despite this , Clinton made no secret that his final target was in the south . Lee observed that this was " certainly a <unk> way of proceeding ; to communicate his full plan to the enemy is too novel to be credited . " This was not even the first notice of the expedition to the colonists ; a letter intercepted in December had already provided intelligence that the British were planning to go to the South . 
 Clinton arrived at Cape Fear on March 12 , expecting to find the European convoy already there . He met with the royal governors of North and South Carolina , Josiah Martin and William Campbell , and learned that the recruited Scottish <unk> had been defeated at Moore 's Creek Bridge two weeks earlier . Clinton also received pleas for assistance from the royal governor of Georgia , James Wright , who had been arrested , and then escaped to a navy ship . 
 Parker 's fleet had an extremely difficult crossing . <unk> by storms and high seas , the first ships of the fleet did not arrive at Cape Fear until April 18 , and Cornwallis did not arrive until May 3 . After several weeks there , in which the British troops raided <unk> properties , Clinton , Cornwallis and Parker concluded that Cape Fear was not a suitable base for further operations . Parker had sent out some ships on <unk> expeditions up and down the coast , and reports on the partially finished condition of the Charleston defenses were sufficiently promising that the decision was made to go there . 
 John <unk> , recently elected president of the General Assembly that remained as the backbone of South Carolina 's revolutionary government , organized a defense force under the command of 46 @-@ year @-@ old Colonel William <unk> , a former <unk> and Indian fighter . These forces comprised three infantry regiments , two rifle regiments , and a small artillery regiment ; they were augmented by three independent artillery companies , and the total force numbered about 2 @,@ 000 . These forces were further augmented by the arrival of Continental regiments from North Carolina and Virginia ( 1 @,@ 900 troops ) , as well as militia numbering 2 @,@ 700 from Charleston and the surrounding <unk> . 
 <unk> saw Sullivan 's Island , a sandy <unk> of land at the entrance to Charleston Harbor extending north about 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) long and a few hundred yards wide , as a place well suited to build a fort that could protect the entrance from <unk> enemy warships . A large vessel sailing into Charleston first had to cross Charleston Bar , a series of submerged <unk> lying about 8 miles ( 13 km ) southeast of the city , and then pass by the southern end of Sullivan 's Island as it entered the channel to the inner harbor . Later it would also have to pass the northern end of James Island , where Fort Johnson commanded the southeastern approach to the city . <unk> and his 2nd South Carolina Regiment arrived on Sullivan 's Island in March 1776 , and began construction of a fortress to defend the island and the channel into Charleston Harbor . The construction moved slowly ; Captain Peter <unk> of the <unk> naval detachment described the site as " an immense pen 500 feet long , and 16 feet wide , filled with sand to stop the shot " . The gun platforms were made of <unk> two inches thick and <unk> with wooden spikes . 
 Congress had appointed General Lee to command the Continental Army troops in the southern colonies , and his movements by land shadowed those of Clinton 's fleet as it sailed south . Lee wrote from Wilmington on June 1 that the fleet had sailed , but that he did not know whether it was sailing for Virginia or South Carolina . He headed for Charleston , saying " [ I ] confess I know not whether I shall go to or from the enemy . " He arrived in Charleston shortly after the fleet anchored outside the harbor , and took command of the city 's defenses . He immediately ran into a problem : the South Carolina troops ( militia or the colonial regiments ) were not on the Continental line , and thus not formally under his authority . Some South Carolina troops resisted his instructions , and <unk> had to intervene by proclaiming Lee in command of all South Carolina forces . 
 Square @-@ shaped Fort Sullivan consisted only of the completed seaward wall , with walls made from <unk> logs 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) high and 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) wide . The walls were filled with sand , and rose 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) above the wooden platforms on which the artillery were mounted . A hastily erected palisade of thick <unk> helped guard the powder magazine and unfinished northern walls . An assortment of 31 cannon , ranging from <unk> and 12 @-@ pounders to a few British 18 @-@ pounders and French 26 @-@ pounders , dotted the front and rear walls . General Lee , when he had seen its unfinished state , had recommended abandoning the fort , calling it a " slaughter pen " . President <unk> refused , and specifically ordered Colonel <unk> to " obey [ Lee ] in everything , except in leaving Fort Sullivan " . <unk> 's delaying tactics so angered Lee that he decided on June 27 that he would replace <unk> ; the battle began the next day before he could do so . Lee did make plans for an orderly retreat to <unk> 's Point . 
 The British fleet weighed anchor at Cape Fear on May 31 , and arrived outside Charleston Harbor the next day . <unk> noticed a British scout boat apparently looking for possible landing points on nearby Long Island ( now known as the Isle of <unk> ) , just a few hundred yards from Sullivan 's Island ; troops were consequently sent to occupy the northern end of Sullivan 's . By June 8 , most of the British fleet had crossed the bar and anchored in Five <unk> Hole , an anchorage between the bar and the harbor entrance . With the fort on Sullivan 's Island only half complete , Admiral Parker expressed confidence that his warships would easily breach its walls . <unk> believing he would not even need Clinton 's land forces , he wrote to Clinton that after the fort 's guns were knocked out , he would " land <unk> and marines ( which I have practiced for the purpose ) under the guns " and that they could " keep possession till you send as many troops as you think proper " . 
 The British fleet was composed of nine man @-@ of @-@ war ships : the flagship 50 @-@ gun Bristol , as well as the 50 @-@ gun Experiment and frigates <unk> , Active , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Friendship and the bomb vessel Thunder , in total mounting nearly 300 cannon . The army forces in the expedition consisted of the 15th , 28th , 33rd , 37th , 54th , and 57th Regiments of Foot , and part of the 46th . On June 7 , Clinton issued a proclamation calling on the rebel colonists to lay down their arms . However , the inexperienced defenders fired on the boat sent to deliver it ( which was flying a truce flag ) , and it was not delivered until the next day . That same day , Clinton began landing 2 @,@ 200 troops on Long Island . The intent was that these troops would <unk> across the channel ( now known as <unk> Inlet ) between Long and Sullivan 's , which the British believed to be sufficiently shallow to do so , while the fleet bombarded Fort Sullivan . 
 General Lee responded to the British landing with several actions . He began reinforcing positions on the mainland in case the British were intending to launch an attack directly on Charleston . He also attempted to build a bridge of boats to provide an <unk> of retreat for the fort 's garrison , but this failed because there were not enough boats to bridge the roughly one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) channel separating the island from Charleston ; the unwillingness of <unk> and <unk> to support the effort may also have played a role . The Americans also constructed an <unk> at the northern end of Sullivan 's Island , which was manned by more than 750 men and three small cannons , and began to <unk> a guard post at <unk> 's Point on the mainland opposite Fort Sullivan . 
 General Clinton encountered the first major problem of the attack plan on June 17 . An attempt to <unk> the channel between the two islands established that part of the channel was at least shoulder @-@ deep , too deep for troops to cross even without the prospect of enemy opposition . He considered using boats to ferry the troops across , but the Americans , with timely advice from General Lee , adopted a strong defensive position that was virtually impossible to bombard from ships or the Long Island position . As a result , the British and American forces faced each other across the channel , engaging in occasional and largely <unk> cannon fire at long range . Clinton reported that this meant that Admiral Parker would have " the glory of being defeated alone . " The attack was originally planned for June 24 , but bad weather and contrary wind conditions prompted Parker to call it off for several days . 
 On the morning of June 28 , Fort Sullivan was defended by Colonel <unk> , commanding the 2nd South Carolina Regiment and a company of the 4th South Carolina Artillery , numbering 435 men . At around 9 : 00 am that morning , a British ship fired a signal gun indicating all was ready for the attack . Less than an hour later , nine warships had sailed into positions facing the fort . Thunder and Friendship anchored about 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) from the fort while Parker took Active , Bristol , Experiment and <unk> to a closer position about 400 yards ( 370 m ) from Sullivan 's Island , where they anchored facing broadside to the fort . Each of these ships began to fire upon the fort when it reached its position , and the defenders returned the fire . Although many of Thunder 's shots landed in or near the fort , they had little effect ; according to <unk> , " We had a <unk> in the middle , that swallowed them up instantly , and those that fell in the sand in and about the fort , were immediately buried " . Thunder 's role in the action was also relatively short @-@ lived ; she had anchored too far away from the fort , and the <unk> of her mortars with extra powder to increase their range eventually led to them breaking out of their mounts . Owing to shortage of gunpowder , <unk> 's men were deliberate in the pace of their gunfire , and only a few officers actually aimed the cannons . They also fired in small <unk> , four cannon at a time . One British observer wrote , " Their fire was surprisingly well served " and it was " slow , but decisive indeed ; they were very cool and took care not to fire except their guns were exceedingly well directed . " 
 General Clinton began movements to cross over to the northern end of Sullivan 's Island . <unk> by two <unk> of war , the flotilla of <unk> carrying his troops came under fire from Colonel William Thomson 's defenses . Facing a withering barrage of grape shot and rifle fire , Clinton abandoned the attempt . 
 At one point during the battle , the flag <unk> had designed and raised over the fort was shot down . Sergeant William Jasper reportedly ran to the <unk> and raised the flag again , holding it up and <unk> the troops until a flag stand could be provided . He was credited by <unk> with reviving the troops ' spirits , and later given <unk> for bravery . A painting of this event ( pictured above ) depicts Jasper 's actions . 
 <unk> casualties , Parker reported 40 sailors killed and 71 wounded aboard Bristol , which was hit more than 70 times with much damage to the hull , yards , and rigging . Experiment was also badly damaged with 23 sailors killed and 56 wounded . Active and <unk> reported 15 casualties each . The Americans reported their casualties at only 12 killed and 25 wounded . The following morning , the British , unable to drag the grounded <unk> off the <unk> , set fire to the ship to prevent her from falling into enemy hands . <unk> in small boats sailed out to the burning ship , fired some of its cannons at the British ships , took what stores and <unk> they could , and retreated shortly before the ship 's powder magazine exploded . 
 The British did not attempt to take the fort again . Within days of the battle , <unk> learned of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia . The British troops were <unk> on their transports , and on July 21 the British fleet withdrew northward to help the main British army in its campaign against New York City . To add insult to injury , one of the British transports grounded off Long Island and was captured by <unk> forces . 
 The British did not return to Charleston until <unk> , when General Clinton successfully besieged the city and captured an entire army . Until the South again became a focus of the war in late 1778 , its states provided military supplies to the northern war effort and produced trade goods that brought in valuable hard currency to fund the war effort . 
 Admiral Parker and General Clinton engaged in a war of words after the battle , each seeking to cast the blame on the other for the expedition 's failures . Although Clinton was not blamed by the government , popular opinion held him responsible , and Parker was lauded for his personal bravery . 
 Fort Sullivan was renamed Fort <unk> shortly after the battle to honor Colonel William <unk> for his successful defense of the fort and the city of Charleston . <unk> modified in the years after the battle , it was <unk> by Fort <unk> as the principal defense of Charleston prior to the outbreak of the American Civil War . In 1876 , to celebrate the centennial , companies from Savannah , Augusta , <unk> , Columbia , New York and Boston were invited to Charleston . The site was turned over to the National Park Service in 1960 , and is now part of Fort <unk> National Monument . 
 A small monument to the Battle of Sullivan 's Island has been placed at the northeastern tip of the island , overlooking the inlet where General Clinton 's soldiers had hoped to cross . The monument includes historical markers describing the events surrounding the engagement . 
 One iconic emblem of the battle was the flag designed by Colonel <unk> . Commissioned by the colonial government , he designed a blue flag with a white crescent in the top left corner , which was flown at the fort during the battle . Despite being shot down during the siege , it was seen as a symbol of this successful defense ( and famously raised during victory ) . It came to be known as the <unk> flag or Liberty Flag . When Charleston ( lost to the British in the <unk> siege ) was reclaimed by American forces at the end of the war , the flag was returned to the city by General <unk> Greene . 
 Hu <unk> ( Chinese : <unk> ; c . <unk> – 1674 ) was a Chinese artist , <unk> and publisher . He worked in calligraphy , traditional Chinese painting , and seal @-@ carving , but was primarily a publisher , producing academic texts as well as records of his own work . 
 Hu lived in <unk> during the transition from the Ming dynasty to the Qing dynasty . A Ming loyalist , he was offered a position at the rump court of the <unk> Emperor , but declined the post , and never held anything more than minor political office . He did , however , design the <unk> Emperor 's personal seal , and his loyalty to the dynasty was such that he largely retired from society after the emperor 's capture and death in 1645 . He owned and operated an academic publishing house called the Ten <unk> Studio , in which he practised various multi @-@ colour printing and <unk> techniques , and he employed several members of his family in this enterprise . Hu 's work at the Ten <unk> Studio pioneered new techniques in colour <unk> , leading to delicate <unk> of colour which were not previously <unk> in this art form . 
 Hu is best known for his manual of painting entitled The Ten <unk> Studio Manual of Painting and <unk> , an artist 's <unk> which remained in print for around 200 years . His studio also published seal catalogues , academic and medical texts , books on poetry , and decorative writing papers . Many of these were edited and prefaced by Hu and his brothers . 
 During Hu 's lifetime , the Ming dynasty , which had ruled China for over 250 years , was overthrown and replaced by China 's last imperial dynasty , the Qing . Following the fall of the capital Beijing in 1644 , remnants of the imperial family and a few ministers set up a Ming loyalist regime in <unk> with Zhu <unk> on the throne as the <unk> Emperor . Hu , who was noted for his seal @-@ carving and facility with seal script , created a seal for the new Emperor . The court offered him the position of <unk> for the <unk> ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) as a reward , but he did not accept the role ( although he did accord himself the title of <unk> <unk> in some of his subsequent personal seals ) . 
 Hu retired from public life and went into seclusion in 1646 , after the end of the Ming dynasty . <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> recorded visiting him during his later years , in 1667 and <unk> respectively . He died in poverty at the age of 90 , sometime around late <unk> or early 1674 . 
 Hu <unk> was a noted seal @-@ <unk> , producing personal seals for numerous dignitaries . His style was rooted in the classical seal script of the Han dynasty , and he followed the <unk> school of carving founded by his contemporary He <unk> . Hu 's calligraphy , although balanced and with a clear <unk> structure , is somewhat more angular and rigid than the classical models he followed . <unk> seals attempt to <unk> an ancient , weathered impression , although unlike other <unk> artists Hu did not make a regular practice of artificially aging his seals . 
 Hu 's work was known outside his local area . Zhou <unk> , a poet who lived in <unk> around the same time as Hu and was a noted art <unk> , stated in his Biography of Seal @-@ <unk> ( <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) that Hu " creates miniature stone carvings with ancient seal inscriptions for travellers to fight over and treasure " , implying that his carvings were popular with visitors and travellers passing through <unk> . 
 This volume went on to influence colour printing across China , where it paved the way for the later but better @-@ known Manual of the <unk> <unk> Garden ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , and also in Japan , where it was reprinted and foreshadowed the development in <unk> @-@ e of the colour <unk> printing process known as <unk> @-@ e <unk> . The popularity of the Ten <unk> Studio Manual was such that print runs continued to be produced all the way through to the late Qing dynasty . 
 Among the studio 's more obscure publications was a text on Chinese <unk> entitled <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) , written under a pseudonym but with a preface by Hu <unk> . 
 The Raid on Manila of January 1798 was a Royal Navy false flag military operation during the French Revolutionary Wars intended to scout the strength of the defences of Manila , capital of the Spanish Philippines , capture a Manila galleon and assess the condition of the Spanish Navy squadron maintained in the port . Spain had transformed from an ally of Great Britain in the War of the First Coalition into an enemy in 1796 . Thus the presence of a powerful Spanish squadron at Manila posed a threat to the China Fleet , an annual convoy of East <unk> merchant ships from <unk> in Qing Dynasty China to Britain , which was of vital economic importance to Britain . So severe was this threat that a major invasion of the Spanish Philippines had been planned from British India during 1797 , but had been called off following the Treaty of <unk> <unk> in Europe and the possibility of a major war in India between the British East India Company and the Kingdom of Mysore . 
 To ensure the safety of the merchant ships gathering at <unk> in the winter of 1797 – 98 , the British commander in the East Indies , Rear @-@ Admiral Peter <unk> , sent a convoy to China escorted by the frigates HMS <unk> and HMS Fox and commanded by Captain Edward Cooke . After completing his mission Cooke decided to investigate the state of readiness of Spanish forces in Manila himself . He was also intrigued by reports that a ship carrying treasure was due to sail from Manila , which would make a valuable prize . <unk> in <unk> and accompanied by Captain Pulteney Malcolm in Fox , Cooke reached the Spanish capital on 13 January 1798 . 
 <unk> in Manila Bay , Cooke pretended that his ships were French vessels and successfully lured successive <unk> of Spanish officials aboard , taking them prisoner in turn . Once he had determined from his captives the state of defences in Manila , that the treasure ship had been <unk> at <unk> and that the Spanish squadron was undergoing extensive repairs and thus unavailable for operations , he sent a raiding party against a squadron of gunboats in the mouth of the <unk> River . <unk> the gunboats in a bloodless attack , Cooke then released his prisoners and sailed southwards , unsuccessfully assaulting <unk> before returning to <unk> . 
 In 1796 , after three years of the French Revolutionary Wars , Spain and the French Republic signed the Treaty of San <unk> . The secret terms of this treaty required Spain to renounce its alliance with Great Britain and subsequently to declare war on its former ally . In the East Indies this shift of political allegiance meant that the dominant British forces in the region were faced with the threat of attack from the Spanish Philippines to the east . Britain dominated the East Indies in 1796 , controlling the trade routes through the Indian Ocean from the ports of Bombay , Madras and Calcutta . Dutch Ceylon , the Dutch Cape Colony and parts of the Dutch East Indies had been captured in 1795 , and the French presence in the region had been confined to Île de France and a few subsidiary islands in the Western Indian Ocean . 
 <unk> 's initial impulse on learning in November 1796 of the impending declaration of war between Britain and Spain was to draw up plans for a major invasion of the Philippines , centred on Manila in repetition of the successful British capture of Manila in <unk> . Co @-@ operating with the Governor @-@ General of India Sir John Shore and Colonel Arthur <unk> among others , a substantial naval and military forces were earmarked for the operation which was in the advance planning stages , when unexpected news arrived in India in August 1797 announcing the Treaty of <unk> <unk> which brought the War of the First Coalition to an end . Britain now faced France and Spain alone , while <unk> from the Tipu Sultan of the Kingdom of Mysore , an old opponent of Britain in Southern India , were seeking French assistance with a renewed outbreak of hostilities . The resources planned for the operation against Manila were therefore retained in India and the operation cancelled , but the protection of the China Fleet was still essential and <unk> diverted some of his squadron eastwards to China . 
 A number of merchant ships had gathered at Bombay in the spring of 1797 in preparation for the trip to <unk> to load trade goods and join the China Fleet . To escort this force , <unk> provided the 40 @-@ gun frigate HMS <unk> , captured from the French at the Battle of <unk> in 1794 , and the 50 @-@ gun HMS Centurion , which sailed with the convoy in July , taking passage through the Straits of <unk> , joined there by the ships of the line HMS <unk> and HMS <unk> and the 32 @-@ gun frigate HMS Fox under Captain Pulteney Malcolm for the final voyage to <unk> . The convoy arrived without incident on 13 December 1797 , although the crews had been substantially weakened by tropical illnesses . 
 With his convoy safely at anchor in <unk> and the China Fleet several weeks from sailing , Cooke decided to reconnoitre Manila and make observations on the port and the Spanish squadron based there . As an added motivation , rumours in <unk> suggested that the annual Manila galleon was due to arrive . This ship brought up to two million Spanish silver dollars from Acapulco across the Pacific Ocean stopping at Guam on its way to Manila . <unk> its dollars in the Philippines , the ship then loaded trade goods from the East Indies for the return journey to New Spain . This round trip was essential to the maintenance of the Spanish Empire in the East Indies , which operated at an enormous financial loss only <unk> by the substantial subsidy from New Spain . Spanish dollars were the accepted currency across most of the East Indies , and disruption of this financial system could have profound effects on regional trade ; but British sailors had nevertheless been attacking the Manila <unk> since Thomas <unk> in <unk> . 
 Leaving the heavier warships at <unk> , Cooke sailed on 5 January 1798 only with <unk> and Fox , the latter carrying a Mr. Bernard , an experienced linguist . Passing Luzon , Cooke 's ships encountered a small Spanish merchant vessel , which was lured towards the frigates , which were flying French <unk> . <unk> the Spanish vessel , Cooke closely questioned the captain and learned that most of the Spanish squadron in Manila were undergoing extensive repairs at <unk> and were unfit to sail . Cooke rewarded the captain by releasing his vessel with its cargo intact , although he did remove 3 @,@ 900 silver dollars . The Spanish squadron had suffered badly in a typhoon in April 1797 and much of the damage had still not been repaired by the time Cooke 's small squadron arrived off Manila . Cooke had taken precautions to disguise his ships as French vessels , modelling <unk> on the powerful 40 @-@ gun Forte and Fox on the smaller <unk> . 
 Fox was the first British ship into the anchorage , and was consequently approached by the <unk> , whose crew came aboard . Malcolm , like Cooke , spoke French <unk> and with Bernard translating was able to persuade the officer in charge that the new <unk> were Forte and <unk> seeking supplies and Spanish reinforcements for commerce raiding operations . The officer offered supplies but cautioned that none of the Spanish ships would be in a position to sail until March at the earliest . Cooke then joined the party on the deck of Fox , claiming to be Commodore <unk> , a French officer who , unknown to the Spanish , had been killed in the Action of 9 September 1796 off Sumatra . The Spanish officer was now completely convinced by the <unk> , which had been augmented by fake French uniforms . <unk> the visitor below decks , Cooke then passed wine around and together they drank a series of <unk> , including " the downfall of England " . 
 For an hour the officers drank , Malcolm and Cooke learning detailed information about the state of the defences and squadron in the Philippines , until a second boat pulled alongside Fox containing more officers keen to <unk> the French <unk> . This vessel was the personal barge of the Spanish commander at <unk> , Rear @-@ Admiral Don <unk> María de <unk> , who was not aboard , but who sent a message via an aide in a third boat . Each time , the officers were escorted below to join the festivities whereupon their crews were seized at <unk> and taken below decks as prisoners of war . In Malcolm 's cabin , the captured officers were informed of their situation , promised release before the British frigates sailed , and offered more wine . The crew of Fox meanwhile forced the captured Spanish sailors to strip and <unk> their clothing . <unk> into the Spanish boats this party rowed for the mouth of the nearby <unk> River , where they had learned that three heavy gunboats were moored . Taking the crews by surprise , the British boarding parties drove off the Spanish without a fight and brought all three boats alongside Fox . These vessels normally carried crews of thirty and were well @-@ armed , one with a 32 @-@ pounder long gun and two with 24 @-@ pounder long guns , each supplemented by four <unk> guns . 
 The harbour captain reached Fox shortly afterwards , furious at the seizure of the gunboats and demanding they be returned . Malcolm received him with a <unk> of near incomprehensible French and brought him to join the other captured officers in his cabin , while the boat 's crew were imprisoned below decks . Shortly afterwards , at 16 : 00 , Cooke and Malcolm hosted a large dinner for their officer captives and sent food and <unk> to the crew , the total number of Spanish sailors on Fox now numbering approximately 200 . Once the meal was finished , Cooke allowed all of the captives to return to their boats and row for shore without the conditions of parole , although he retained the captured gunboats . 
 Cooke 's opportunistic diversion had determined that the Spanish forces in the Philippines posed no immediate threat , although the mission had cost 18 lives : Admiral <unk> later expressed his satisfaction with the outcome in a letter to the Admiralty . More might have been achieved with reinforcements : Historian C. <unk> Parkinson suggests that had Cooke 's squadron united with Resistance together they may have been able to destroy the disarmed Spanish warships at <unk> . He also notes however that in this scenario <unk> would have been commanding officer , a man with considerably less imagination and <unk> than Cooke . Historian Richard <unk> was critical of the mission , considering the operation to have " no glorious outcome " and citing the failure to capture the treasure ships as its greatest short @-@ coming . 
 B of the Bang was a sculpture by Thomas <unk> next to the City of Manchester Stadium in Manchester , England , which was commissioned to mark the 2002 Commonwealth Games ; it was one of the tallest structures in Manchester and the tallest sculpture in the UK until the completion of <unk> in 2008 . It was taller and leaned at a greater angle than the <unk> Tower of <unk> . The sculpture took its name from a quotation of British <unk> <unk> Christie , in which he said that he started his races not merely at the " <unk> " of the starting pistol , but at " the B of the Bang " . 
 The sculpture was commissioned in 2003 ; construction overran and the official unveiling was delayed until 12 January 2005 . Six days before the launch , the sculpture suffered the first of three visible structural problems as the tip of one of the spikes detached and fell to the ground . Legal action started a year later , resulting in an out @-@ of @-@ court settlement totalling £ 1 @.@ 7 million . 
 In February 2009 , Manchester City Council announced that the sculpture would be dismantled and placed in storage . Despite the promise of storage and potential <unk> , the core and legs of the sculpture were cut apart during removal . The core was sold for scrap in July 2012 , while the 180 spikes remain in storage . 
 B of the Bang originally stood 56 metres ( 184 ft ) tall with 180 hollow tapered steel columns or spikes radiating from a central core . It was angled at 30 degrees and supported by five 25 m ( 82 ft ) long , tapered steel legs which connected to the spikes 22 m ( 72 ft ) above the ground . The sculpture weighed 165 tonnes , with the concrete in the foundations weighing over 1 @,@ 000 tonnes , including a 400 m2 ( 4 @,@ 300 sq ft ) reinforced concrete slab . The foundations are 20 m ( 66 ft ) deep . 
 The sculpture was made from the same <unk> steel ( also known as <unk> @-@ Ten ) as the Angel of the North sculpture , which gradually develops a tightly adhering oxide layer as it is exposed to the elements . This layer inhibits further corrosion by reducing its <unk> to water . As part of the design , the spikes <unk> slightly in the wind in order to withstand gusts in excess of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) . At the time of construction a time capsule was placed in one of the spikes of the sculpture , containing children 's poems and paintings , due to be opened circa 2300 . The location of the time capsule after <unk> is currently unknown . 
 B of the Bang was located next to the City of Manchester Stadium at <unk> , in <unk> , at the corner of Alan Turing Way and Ashton New Road ; . It took its name from a quotation of British <unk> <unk> Christie in which he said that he started his races not merely at the ' <unk> ' of the starting pistol , but at ' The B of the Bang ' . The artwork had been nicknamed <unk> by the locals after the popular children 's game from the 1970s . 
 Prior to the construction of <unk> at the University of Nottingham , B of the Bang was Britain 's tallest sculpture at well over twice the height of the Angel of the North , which stands at 66 feet ( 20 m ) . It was designed to look like an exploding <unk> and was taller and leaned at a greater angle than the <unk> Tower of <unk> . It was commissioned by New East Manchester Limited to commemorate the 2002 Commonwealth Games . The design was selected by a panel consisting of both local residents and art experts via a competition in 2002 and was designed by Thomas <unk> . 
 The sculpture was constructed in Sheffield by Thomas <unk> Studio , <unk> Lucas , Flint and <unk> and <unk> Structures . It was approved at the start of 2003 , with the central core arriving in Manchester on 13 June 2004 . This was the largest load that could be transferred via road from the factory , and required a police escort . This central core was lifted into place in August 2004 , after which the 180 spikes could begin being attached . Early estimates had given an optimistic completion date of July 2003 , which contributed to the sculpture gaining the nickname G of the Bang . 
 In total the sculpture cost £ 1 @.@ 42 million to design and construct — twice the original estimate , as the initial costing had neglected to include installation costs . Funding was sourced from a European Regional Development Fund contribution of £ 700 @,@ 000 , the North West Development Agency , contributing £ 500 @,@ 000 , and Manchester City Council providing £ 120 @,@ 000 . 
 The tip of one of the 2 @.@ 1 m ( 6 @.@ 9 ft ) spikes detached and fell from the sculpture on 6 January 2005 , only six days before the official unveiling . After inspection , the event went ahead as planned . 
 Four months later , in May 2005 , a second spike had to be cut off by <unk> after it was discovered hanging loose . At that time the sculpture was closed off to the public , and the junction and pathway near the sculpture were temporarily closed . As a result , some of the joints were re @-@ <unk> , with equipment put in place to prevent excessive movement . This consisted of <unk> tip weights to 70 % of the spikes ' weights . 
 Despite these modifications , B of the Bang remained <unk> off , prompting a local newspaper campaign to ' Get It <unk> ' . In May 2006 a total of nine spikes were removed from the sculpture and taken away for <unk> analysis , to discover the stresses being placed on the steel . 
 It was announced in October 2007 that Manchester City Council were taking legal action against the makers of the sculpture , with the aim of completing the necessary repairs to the sculpture . In November 2008 this culminated in an out @-@ of @-@ court settlement being reached between Manchester City Council , the project 's designers Thomas <unk> Studio Ltd , and the engineering and construction <unk> <unk> Lucas Ltd , Flint and <unk> Partnership and <unk> Structures Ltd . The agreement was to pay the council £ <unk> in damages for breach of contract and negligence . 
 Acting on a report in January 2009 , the city council recommended that B of the Bang should be dismantled and placed in storage until funds could be raised for its safe <unk> . The report recognised the sculpture 's aesthetic value for Manchester and Manchester City Council committed itself to working with the artist to reach a long @-@ term solution . One possibility involved the replacement of the steel spikes with <unk> made from carbon fibre , although the report <unk> the necessity for extensive testing . 
 In January 2009 , Antony <unk> , creator of the Angel of the North — to which B of the Bang is often compared — spoke out in support of the sculpture , stating that , " It is a great tribute to Manchester that this ground @-@ breaking work was commissioned . To allow it to disappear would be a loss not just of an inspirational artwork but also of the council 's <unk> . " 
 Despite <unk> 's plea , removal of B of the Bang began in April 2009 . More substantial hoarding was erected around the site and demolition firm <unk> Brothers Limited began removing the spikes with <unk> cutting equipment . 
 Although the council had promised to store the complex central core and legs , these too were cut apart during removal , casting doubt on future prospects for the landmark sculpture 's return , and in early July 2012 the core was sold as scrap for £ 17 @,@ 000 . 
 The Battle of the <unk> River took place during the Second World War and involved Australian , New Zealand and Japanese forces . Part of the wider <unk> Campaign of the Pacific theatre , the battle was fought in the southern sector of <unk> Island . Coming after the Battle of <unk> 's Knoll in which a strong Japanese counterattack was defeated , the battle occurred in two distinct periods between 17 April and 22 May 1945 , as elements of the Australian 15th Brigade advanced south along the <unk> Road . 
 The initial phase saw the Australians advance towards the <unk> River . Following the end of the early fighting , the Australian advance towards the main Japanese concentration at <unk> continued as they struck out towards the <unk> and <unk> Rivers . This continued until torrential rain and flooding brought the advance to a halt short of the objective , <unk> away many bridges and roads upon which the Australians relied for supplies . As the Australian advance stalled , the Japanese began harassing the Australian line of communications , and as the rain stopped and the flooding subsided in late @-@ July and into August , the Australians began making preparations to resume the advance towards <unk> again . Ultimately , though , the war came to an end before the final Australian advance began , bringing the campaign to an end . 
 Japanese forces had landed on <unk> in early 1942 , capturing it from the small force of Australians <unk> the island . They had subsequently developed several <unk> on the island , using it to conduct operations in the northern Solomon Islands and to attack the Allied lines of communication between the United States , Australia and the Southwest Pacific Area . These bases also helped protect Rabaul , the major Japanese garrison and naval base in Papua New Guinea , and throughout 1943 , Allied planners determined that <unk> was vital for <unk> the Japanese base around Rabaul . 
 US Marines conducted an amphibious landing at Cape <unk> , on the western coast of the island , north of Empress Augusta Bay , in November 1943 . After an initial counter @-@ attack , the US Marines had been replaced by a garrison of US Army troops who began consolidating their position around <unk> , establishing a strong perimeter . In March 1944 , the Japanese launched a heavy counter @-@ attack , which was turned back with heavy casualties . After this , the situation on <unk> became largely static , as the Japanese focused primarily on subsistence , and the US forces chose to adopt a mainly defensive posture focused on maintaining the perimeter around <unk> . 
 In late 1944 , as part of plans to free US troops up for the Philippines campaign , the Australian II Corps — consisting of mainly Militia troops under the command of Lieutenant General Stanley <unk> — took over responsibility for Allied operations on <unk> from the American XIV Corps . Australian forces began arriving on the island between November and December 1944 , initially establishing themselves around the US base at <unk> . Due to inaccurate intelligence , <unk> mistakenly believed that the Japanese forces on the island numbered just 17 @,@ 500 men , and he consequently decided that the Australians would pursue an aggressive campaign to clear the Japanese from <unk> in order to free their troops for subsequent operations elsewhere , rather than maintaining the defensive posture the US forces had adopted . However , Allied estimates of Japanese strength were later found to be grossly inaccurate and after the war it was found that the number of Japanese on the island at this time was closer to 40 @,@ 000 . 
 The campaign that Australian planners developed entailed three separate drives : in the north , it was planned that Japanese forces would be forced into the narrow <unk> Peninsula and contained ; in the centre the seizure of Pearl Ridge would give the Australians control of the east – west avenues of approach , as well as <unk> them protection against further counter @-@ attacks , while also opening the way for a drive to the east coast ; and the main campaign in the south , where the bulk of the Japanese forces were concentrated around <unk> . 
 Following the capture of Pearl Ridge in December 1944 , the Australian 7th Brigade had been moved south and allocated to the drive towards <unk> . In late March and early April 1945 , they had fought the Battle of <unk> 's Knoll after which a brief lull followed as the Australians paused to shorten their supply lines . Meanwhile , the survivors of the Japanese force , heavily demoralised by their defeat , withdrew towards the <unk> River . The Australian 3rd Division was then ordered to resume its advance south , being tasked with capturing the <unk> River , while the <unk> was also included as an " intermediate objective " . Japanese strength in the southern sector was estimated by the Australians at about 10 @,@ 500 men , of which 2 @,@ 300 were believed to be directly opposing the 3rd Division . The 15th Brigade was considered to be the most experienced of the Australian units on <unk> at the time and was moved up to relieve the 7th Brigade , which was in need of rest . 
 Under the command of Brigadier <unk> <unk> the 15th Brigade consisted of three infantry battalions as well as two troops of tanks from the 2 / 4th Armoured Regiment , engineers from the 15th Field Company , a battery of 155 @-@ mm guns from ' U ' Heavy Battery , field artillery from the 2nd Field Regiment , and a number of smaller support units . The <unk> / 59th Infantry Battalion took over responsibility for <unk> 's Knoll replacing the 25th Infantry Battalion while the 24th Infantry Battalion took up a position across the <unk> Road . The brigade 's third battalion — the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion — did not join them until the beginning of May , and so the 7th Brigade 's 9th Infantry Battalion continued patrolling operations north of the <unk> River , in the <unk> area , until the 57th / 60th could dispatch elements to relieve them . Further inland , the 2 / 8th Commando Squadron advanced in a wide arc to the south @-@ east , defending the brigade 's left , or eastern , flank . 
 <unk> their advance , the Australians were supported by three squadrons of <unk> from the Royal New Zealand Air Force — Nos. 14 , 22 and 26 Squadrons — which bombed and <unk> the ground in front of the advancing infantry , as well as a <unk> barrage of artillery and mortar fire . With such strong support the Japanese offered little resistance and over the course of two days the 24th Infantry Battalion covered almost a third of the distance to the <unk> , for just one man wounded . Further progress was made over the next week , but on 4 May the advance was slowed when they encountered a roadblock defended by a field gun along with a machine gun , mines and other improvised explosive devices . After this , the 15th Brigade 's engineer support were called upon to regularly carry out route clearance and proving operations as the Japanese became increasingly desperate to destroy the Australian armour , to the extent that they were prepared to sacrifice an artillery piece in order to lure the Australian tanks into a trap where they could be destroyed by mines . The Japanese began to adapt their tactics in other ways also . To <unk> the effectiveness of the Australian tanks , the Japanese began to position themselves off the roads , forcing the infantry to fight without their armoured support . Additionally , the Japanese began to concentrate their artillery with increasing accuracy upon the advancing infantry , which they kept under constant observation and fire . 
 Meanwhile , the previous day , 3 May , the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion had begun operating along the parallel Commando Road to the north . Here they had a number of encounters and suffered casualties due to their inexperience in patrolling , which resulted in them being ambushed . They also kept up a steady advance and eventually beat the main force in reaching , and crossing the river , arriving there on 6 May . On 5 May , along the <unk> Road , the 24th Infantry Battalion had pressed forward again . <unk> with a tank troop in support , they came up against a concealed field gun defended by approximately 100 Japanese . After the lead Matilda 's machine gun jammed , the field gun opened fire on it , damaging it and wounding its crew . Moving around the stricken tank , the second Matilda , armed with a howitzer , opened fire and destroyed the field gun before sweeping the Japanese defenders from the position . That night , the Japanese artillery opened up on the Australian position with a heavy barrage , and the following morning put in a company @-@ sized counter @-@ attack . The fighting lasted for over two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hours , but when it was over the Australians remained in possession of the position having repulsed the attack . In doing so , they suffered one killed and nine wounded , while the attacking Japanese had suffered heavily , losing 58 men killed . It was the biggest loss since the action at <unk> 's Knoll and it spelt the end of their attempt to defend the <unk> . 
 After this , the Australians were able to resume their advance to the river on 7 May without further opposition . The previous three weeks in which they had advanced 7 @,@ 000 yd ( 6 @,@ 400 m ) to the <unk> had been costly for them , however , with the Australian 24th Infantry Battalion losing 25 killed and 95 wounded . Against this , the Japanese had lost at least 169 killed . 
 Following the advance to the <unk> , there was a pause of about a week as the Australians had to wait for roads to be improved and supplies to be brought up , before attempting to cross the <unk> en <unk> . This allowed <unk> to re @-@ evaluate the situation and to issue new orders for the advance towards the <unk> and <unk> Rivers . As they waited for the advance to resume , the Australians carried out reconnaissance patrols deep into Japanese held territory and there were a couple of significant engagements during this time . As a part of these , the 24th Infantry Battalion sent a company across the <unk> and subsequently located a strong Japanese position on a feature that became known as <unk> 's Ridge , which , due to its location , commanded the main Australian axis of advance . 
 The main crossing was planned for 20 May , with the <unk> / 59th Infantry Battalion on the right tasked to cut the <unk> Road and the <unk> Track to the east of the river , while on the left the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion would divert the attention of the Japanese off the 24th Infantry Battalion which would make the main frontal assault from the centre of the Australian line , crossing at the <unk> <unk> , advancing straight up the <unk> Road . Preliminary moves began before this , and on 15 May a platoon from the 24th Infantry Battalion along with two tanks attempted to carry out an attack on <unk> 's Ridge . After one of the tanks was held up and knocked out by a Japanese field gun , they were forced to withdraw . Meanwhile , the <unk> <unk> squadrons — now reinforced by No. 16 Squadron — began an eight @-@ day aerial campaign , attacking along the length of the <unk> and Commando Roads . During this period , the New Zealanders flew 381 sorties , while artillery and mortars fired " thousands of rounds " . 
 Two days later , on 17 May , the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion began its diversionary move on the left flank , crossing the <unk> inland and advancing along the Commando Road with 32 <unk> and two batteries of artillery in support . Crossing 500 yd ( 460 m ) north of the <unk> , the centre company carried out an attack along the far bank of the river without its armoured support which had been unable to negotiate the crossing . Nevertheless , shortly before noon they had secured the crossing and began to fan out , carrying out further flanking moves before establishing a firm base to receive supplies and from where it began patrolling operations on 20 May . 
 In the centre , the main attack along the <unk> Road began at 08 : 30 on 20 May after 20 minutes of <unk> by New Zealand <unk> had prepared the ground . <unk> under a <unk> barrage , and with mortar and machine gun support , the 24th Infantry Battalion moved forward with three companies up front and one held back in reserve , along with two troops of Matilda tanks . <unk> the forward companies reached their objectives , but one of the companies was halted just short of their objective and was forced to dig @-@ in overnight after coming under heavy small arms and artillery fire and losing four killed and five wounded . The attack was resumed the following day , and the Australians were able to advance to the <unk> <unk> ; however , they were prevented from moving any further as the Japanese were still concentrated in large numbers further to the west where an Australian patrol encountered 70 Japanese and were forced to go to ground . Finally , a company from the 24th Infantry Battalion was able to move on to the high ground on <unk> 's Ridge , which they found to be heavily mined and booby trapped . Engineers and assault pioneers were called up to clear the feature . 
 On the right flank , the <unk> / 59th Infantry Battalion carried out a wide flanking move along a track that had been carved out of the west bank of the <unk> by <unk> . Beginning their move two days earlier , a number of patrols had had contacts with the Japanese . Meanwhile , using <unk> to drag the tanks through the mud , the Australian armour had crossed the river also and by 16 : 00 on 20 May the battalion had managed to establish itself in an assembly area to the east of the river , <unk> to the Japanese . The following day , the battalion left the line of departure and began to advance on its primary objective , which it reached in the early afternoon despite being held up while the tanks attempted to affect a creek crossing , and further delayed by stiff resistance . Later , after one of the battalion 's patrols came under heavy fire , the tanks moved up and attacked a Japanese gun position which the defenders quickly abandoned , leaving behind a 70 mm gun and a large amount of ammunition . 
 By 22 May , although there were still a number of Japanese in the area which continued to harass and ambush their line of communications , most of the Australian objectives had been secured and <unk> up operations began . The last remaining defensive location before the <unk> was <unk> 's Ridge , where the Japanese were sheltering in tunnels . A heavy aerial and artillery bombardment devastated the position and forced them to abandon the ridge . It was subsequently occupied by a company of Australian infantry . Within a short period of time the <unk> Road was subsequently opened , providing the Australians with the means with which to bring up supplies for the next stage of the campaign , being the advance to the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> Rivers . The final phase of the battle cost the Japanese 106 killed , while the Australians lost 13 killed and 64 wounded . 
 During the course of the fighting around the <unk> , the Australians lost 38 men killed and 159 wounded , while the Japanese lost at least 275 men killed . Following the battle , the Australians continued their advance towards <unk> at the southern end of the island . Throughout the remainder of the month and into June , the 15th Brigade advanced along the <unk> Road , crossing the <unk> on 10 June . Beyond the river , the Japanese resolved to hold the food growing areas in order to protect their precarious food supply , and they consequently occupied a series of deep <unk> . These were steadily reduced with airstrikes and artillery , and the 15th Brigade subsequently crossed <unk> River before being relieved by Brigadier Noel Simpson 's 29th Brigade in early July . 
 As the 29th Brigade advanced toward the <unk> River , torrential rain and flooding ultimately brought the advance to a halt . The height of the river rose 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) . The <unk> Road was reduced , in the words of Gavin Long , " to a sea of mud " and many of the bridges upon which the Australian supply system was dependent were washed away . This rendered large @-@ scale offensive infantry operations impossible and as the situation worsened for a period of time the Australians even ceased patrolling operations across the <unk> ; meanwhile , the Japanese continued to harass the Australians , probing their positions and setting mines and traps , targeting the Australian line of communications . On 9 July , the 15th Infantry Battalion fought off a series of attacks around <unk> , at the junction of the <unk> River and the <unk> Road , which included a heavy Japanese artillery bombardment . Australian patrols were resumed in late July and continued into August . These attacks proved very costly , particularly amongst the Australian engineers that were tasked with rebuilding the bridges and roads that had been destroyed in the flooding . 
 Fighting in the northern sector continued during this time also , and although preparations in the south for the final advance towards <unk> continued into August , combat operations on the island ceased as the war came to an end before these were completed . As a result , the final Australian operations on <unk> took place on the <unk> front in the northern sector , where the Australians had been conducting a holding action since the failed landing at <unk> <unk> had forced them to abandon plans for an advance into the <unk> Peninsula . By mid @-@ August , however , following the dropping of two atomic bombs on <unk> and <unk> and Japan 's subsequent unconditional surrender , a cease fire was ordered on the island and although there were minor clashes following this , it spelt an end to major combat operations . 
 Following the end of the war , the Australian Army awarded three battle honours for the fighting around the <unk> River . The 2 / 4th Armoured Regiment , and the 9th , 24th , 57th / 60th and <unk> / 59th Infantry Battalions received the battle honour " <unk> River " . A second battle honour — " <unk> 's Ridge – <unk> Ford " — was also awarded to the 2 / 4th Armoured Regiment , and the 24th and <unk> / 59th Infantry Battalions for the second stage of the fighting , while the 57th / 60th Infantry Battalion received the separate battle honour of " Commando Road " for this period . 
 Sonic the Hedgehog is a platform video game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis console . The game was first released in North America , Europe and Australia in June 1991 , and in Japan the following month . The game features an anthropomorphic <unk> named Sonic in a quest to defeat Dr. <unk> , a scientist who has imprisoned animals in robots and stolen the magical Chaos <unk> . Sonic the Hedgehog 's gameplay involves collecting rings as a form of health and a simple control scheme , with jumping and attacking controlled by a single button . 
 The game 's development began in 1990 , when Sega ordered its <unk> development team to create a game featuring a mascot for the company . After considering a number of suggestions , the developers decided on a blue <unk> with spikes along his head and spine and renamed themselves " Sonic Team " to match their character . Sonic the Hedgehog , designed for fast gameplay , was influenced by the games of Super Mario series creator , Shigeru Miyamoto . Sonic the Hedgehog uses a novel technique that allows Sonic 's sprite to roll along curved scenery , which originated in a tech demo created by the game 's programmer , <unk> <unk> . 
 The game was well received by critics , who praised its visuals , music , and speed of gameplay . The game was also commercially successful , establishing the Genesis as a key player in the 16 @-@ bit era and allowing it to compete with Nintendo and their Super <unk> console . It has been ported a number of times , and inspired several <unk> , a successful franchise , and adaptations by other media . 
 In an attempt to steal the six Chaos <unk> and <unk> their power , the game 's antagonist , Dr. Ivo <unk> , has trapped the animal inhabitants of South Island in aggressive robots and stationary metal capsules . The player controls Sonic , who aims to halt <unk> 's plans by freeing his animal friends and collecting the <unk> himself . 
 If the player collects all the Chaos <unk> and completes the game , a reward ending sequence is shown . If all the <unk> are not collected , <unk> taunts the player while <unk> the Chaos <unk> instead . 
 Sonic the Hedgehog is a 2D , side @-@ scrolling platformer , whose gameplay centers around Sonic 's ability to run at high speed through levels incorporating springs , slopes , high falls , and loop @-@ the @-@ loops . The levels contain <unk> in the form of robots ( " <unk> " in the Western game manuals ) inside of which Dr. <unk> has trapped animals . Although destroying a robot frees the animal within , this is not required to complete the game . The player must avoid rows of sharp spikes , falling into <unk> pits , being crushed by moving walls or platforms , and drowning ( which can be avoided by breathing air bubbles periodically released from <unk> ) . Sonic 's main attack is his spin , where he <unk> into a ball and <unk> rapidly ( damaging enemies and some obstacles ) . This can be performed by jumping in the air or rolling on the ground . 
 <unk> around each level map are gold rings , and collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life . <unk> are a layer of protection against <unk> ; if Sonic has at least one ring when he <unk> with an enemy ( or obstacle ) , he will survive . However , all his rings will be scattered ; they will <unk> and disappear in a few seconds if they are not picked up again . If Sonic is hit without any rings , he loses a life . Although shields and temporary <unk> may be collected to provide additional protection , certain <unk> ( such as drowning , being crushed , falling down a <unk> pit or running out of time ) will cost Sonic a life regardless of rings or other protection . 
 The game is divided into six zones ( Green Hill , <unk> , Spring Yard , Labyrinth , Star Light , and <unk> Brain ) , each with its own visual style and enemies . A player must navigate through each zone ( subdivided into three acts ) to progress . At the end of each zone 's third act , the player confronts Dr. <unk> ( who pilots a different vehicle each time ) in a boss fight . After the sixth zone , the player continues directly to the Final Zone for a last encounter with <unk> . 
 The player begins with three lives ( power @-@ ups and rings add more ) , which are lost when Sonic <unk> with hazardous enemies ( or objects ) without rings , falls off @-@ screen or exceeds an act 's ten @-@ minute time limit . <unk> acting as checkpoints allow Sonic to return to the most @-@ recently activated post when he loses a life . If he loses a life as a result of time running out but has another life , the <unk> will reset to 0 : 00 when he returns to the <unk> . If all lives are lost at any point in the game , the game over screen will appear ( when the player can return to the beginning of the act with three lives , if they have any continues ) . 
 When Sonic reaches the end of act one or act two of a zone with at least fifty rings , a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a Special Stage ( a " Secret Zone " in the original Genesis manual ) . In each of six Special <unk> , Sonic <unk> off the <unk> and walls of a rotating maze in spin attack . Although the player earns a continue with each 50 rings found , their main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald at the end of the maze without colliding with a " goal block " ( which ends the level ) . 
 In 1990 , Sega ordered its in @-@ house development studio , <unk> , to develop a game featuring a mascot for the company . This was a position already held by the character Alex <unk> , but he was considered similar to Mario and deemed unsatisfactory ; Sega president <unk> <unk> wanted a character as iconic as Mickey Mouse . Sega had competition from Nintendo and its mascot , Mario , in mind ; Nintendo was dominant at the time , particularly after the release of the successful Super Mario Bros. 3 , and Sega wanted a foothold in the industry . Although the company had some success with Genesis ports of its arcade titles , it knew this would not be enough . 
 Sonic was originally <unk> @-@ colored , then a light shade of blue , but he was changed to dark blue so he would stand out against certain backgrounds and to match the Sega logo . His shoes were colored red through the inspiration of Michael Jackson 's boots on the album cover for Bad and the outfit of Santa Claus , whom <unk> saw as the most " famous character in the world " . Sonic 's spikes were emphasized to make him look <unk> , and he was given the ability to spin while jumping ( so attacking and jumping could be controlled with one button ) . The new character was originally named " Mr. <unk> " , but the eight @-@ member <unk> changed his name to " Sonic " and their studios to Sonic Team . <unk> proposed to flesh out the character included placing him in a rock band , giving him vampire fangs , and giving him a human girlfriend named Madonna , but Sega of America scrapped these ideas to keep his identity simple . Sega of America also expressed concerns that most Americans would not know what a <unk> is and initially proposed a full @-@ scale recreation of the character , but compromised with Sonic Team to simply make design changes . The antagonist ended up being named " Dr. <unk> " in Japan and " Dr. <unk> " in other regions as a result of a dispute between Sega 's American and Japanese divisions . 
 <unk> 's relationship with Sega of Japan was tenuous during this time ; he received little credit for his involvement in the game . He left the company shortly after the game 's release , although Sega of America hired him later . Before leaving , however , he defied Sega of Japan 's prohibition of developer credits by displaying a few names in black text on a black background , identifiable only by looking at the game 's code . 
 On October 19 , 2011 , twenty years after the game 's release , a three @-@ disc compilation of music from Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was released in Japan . The first disc features original tracks from both games , the second contains Masato <unk> 's demo recordings and the third comprises songs by Dreams Come True and their <unk> remixes . 
 Game @-@ package illustrator Akira <unk> said that his goal was to make the characters " colorful " , using clear lines and <unk> to " finish them <unk> " . According to <unk> , the developers asked him to create a package design " similar to pop art ... without being particular to conventional packages " – something " original " and " stylish " . The game was released in North America , Europe , and Australia on June 23 , 1991 , and in Japan on July 26 . Sega of America packaged it with American Genesis consoles , replacing <unk> Beast . Genesis owners who bought their consoles before the switch could request free copies of Sonic the Hedgehog by mail . Sega of America created a large @-@ scale marketing campaign to promote the game and Sonic as a mascot for the company . 
 A port , Sonic the Hedgehog Genesis , was released for the Game Boy Advance ( GBA ) on November 14 , 2006 in United States to mark the game 's fifteenth anniversary . It included several new features , such as the ability to save game progress , a level select option , and an <unk> Mode with the Spin <unk> move ( not originally implemented until Sonic the Hedgehog 2 ) . Its screen is slightly <unk> in , and adapted to the GBA 's widescreen aspect ratio . The game received poor reviews , with a Metacritic score of 33 percent ; the chief complaints concerned its poor conversion to the Game Boy Advance ( resulting in a slow frame rate ) , remixed <unk> music , and poor preservation of the original gameplay . 
 With its sequels for the Genesis , Sonic the Hedgehog has been ported for a wide range of home and handheld consoles and personal computers . It has appeared in Sonic Compilation ( 1995 ) for the Genesis , Sonic Jam ( 1997 ) for the Sega Saturn and <unk> , Sonic Mega Collection ( 2002 ) , Sonic Mega Collection Plus ( 2004 ) , Sonic 's Ultimate Genesis Collection ( 2009 ) for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 , and Sonic Classic Collection ( 2010 ) for the Nintendo DS . Additionally , the game is an <unk> reward in the console versions of Sonic <unk> . 
 Sonic the Hedgehog was critically praised at its release and in retrospective reviews , with an 86 @-@ percent approval rating at the review aggregator GameRankings based on nine reviews . The game rivaled the Mario series , particularly Super Mario World ( which was recently released for Genesis rival Super Nintendo Entertainment System ) . Paul Rand of Computer and Video Games compared the two in depth and characterized Sonic the Hedgehog as being faster , with brighter colors , and Super Mario World as having more " depth of play " . 
 Reviewers noted the game 's colorful , detailed graphics . Rand called its color scheme " lively , but never <unk> " , praising the interaction of color with detail in the sprites , backgrounds , and animations and describing its graphics as the best available for the Genesis . Reviewer Boogie Man of GamePro called the intricate backgrounds " eye @-@ popping " and " gorgeous " , which was echoed by Mean Machines . According to the <unk> ( Hartley , Patricia , and Kirk ) of Dragon , " The graphics and animation in Sonic the Hedgehog make this a serious contender for the best video game of the year " and <unk> called the animation " some of the <unk> and fastest ... ever seen " . The music and sound effects were also well received ; Dragon called them " great " , and <unk> " amazing " . Rand noted " <unk> of catchy tunes and <unk> " , calling some of the sound effects " absolutely brilliant " . Although Mean Machines called the songs " vaguely appealing " , the game 's sound effects were better appreciated . 
 Critics cited the fast gameplay , unprecedented in <unk> . GamePro 's Boogie Man noted its " lightning @-@ fast action " and , according to Electronic Gaming Monthly ( <unk> ) , " If you thought the Enterprise was quick , wait till you see Sonic at <unk> speed . " The game 's difficulty was disputed , described as " impossible " by Rand and " average " by <unk> . Rand said about the gameplay in general that it " plays like a dream " ; according to <unk> it would <unk> players for hours , and Boogie Man praised Sonic Team 's ability to provide an engaging experience primarily from running and jumping . Although <unk> , Dragon , and Paul of Mean Machines praised the level design ( especially the hidden rooms ) , Paul found losing all of one 's rings frustrating . 
 Sonic the Hedgehog has maintained its popularity , appearing on lists of the greatest video games of all time . Frank <unk> of GameSpot described the game as " one of the best <unk> of all time " , noting that despite technical issues in the Game Boy Advance port " after all these years , the underlying graphics , audio , and gameplay still hold up " . Lucas M. Thomas of IGN agreed that it stood the test of time : " You 'll be impressed by the clarity and color that come through ... Few people realize how difficult it was to create Sonic 's graphics engine , which allowed for the incredible rate of speed the game 's known for . But the technical achievement impressed back in ' 91 , and still does so today . " Mega ranked the game its third @-@ favorite Genesis title , and in 2001 Game Informer called it the 24th @-@ greatest game of all time . Sonic the Hedgehog has been a commercial success ; the original Genesis version sold over 15 million copies by February 2009 , and the mobile version had eight million paid downloads by 2008 . 
 Primarily because of its Genesis <unk> , Sonic the Hedgehog contributed to the console 's North American popularity . During October – December 1991 , the Genesis <unk> the Super <unk> by a two @-@ to @-@ one ratio , and at its January 1992 peak claimed 65 percent of the market for 16 @-@ bit consoles . Although Nintendo eventually again overtook Sega , this was the first time since December 1985 that the company did not lead the console market . 
 Sonic the Hedgehog added speed and momentum @-@ based physics to the standard platform formula . Set @-@ pieces and mechanics introduced by the game ( such as loops , springs , and acceleration pads ) have appeared in other games and become associated with the Sonic series . 
 The game 's success led Sega to develop an extensive media franchise . A 1992 sequel , Sonic the Hedgehog 2 , gave Sonic a best friend ( and sidekick ) named Miles " <unk> " <unk> and continued the fight against Dr. <unk> . Sonic has generated dozens of additional games and a large cast of recurring characters ( keeping Sonic and <unk> as <unk> ) , surviving the end of Sega console manufacturing after the <unk> . The series has ventured from <unk> to fighting , racing , role @-@ playing , and sports games , and has expanded into anime and manga , cartoons and comic books , novels , and toys . Sonic the Hedgehog has become one of the best @-@ selling video game franchises of all time , with over 150 million copies sold by May 2014 . The game 's first stage , Green Hill Zone , has also been re @-@ <unk> for use in several other titles such as Sonic Adventure 2 , Sonic <unk> and the Super Smash Bros. series . 
 " The Same Old Story " is the second episode of the first season of the American science fiction drama television series Fringe . The episode was written by executive producer Jeff Pinkner and co @-@ creators J. J. Abrams , Alex <unk> , and Roberto Orci . When developing the series , they sought to find a medium between serialized drama and the crime procedural . " The Same Old Story " was the first regular episode of Fringe , and journalists viewed it as an example of what they could expect from the series . It was directed by Paul A. Edwards . 
 After a newborn baby rapidly ages into an 80 @-@ year @-@ old man , Fringe division agent Olivia Dunham ( Anna Torv ) and consultants Peter ( Joshua Jackson ) and Walter Bishop ( John Noble ) investigate . They tie the case to the murders of young women , who have all had their <unk> glands removed . It is revealed that Dr. Claus <unk> ( Mark <unk> ) , an expert in <unk> , is working to help his son Christopher ( Derek Cecil ) stay alive , as he suffers from rapid aging syndrome . 
 " The Same Old Story " first aired in the United States on September 16 , 2008 on Fox . An estimated 13 @.@ 272 million viewers watched the episode , a 45 percent increase from the series premiere . The episode received mixed reviews from television critics – reviewers thought it was an improvement from the previous episode but faulted it for containing plot <unk> . 
 As they <unk> up the case , Olivia , Peter , and Walter complete forms to <unk> their position in the Fringe division . When Peter is out of <unk> , Walter learns from Olivia that the FBI medical files on Peter 's childhood are void of any details . 
 Co @-@ creators J. J. Abrams , Alex <unk> and Roberto Orci , and executive producer Jeff Pinkner wrote the episode . Paul A. Edwards served as the director , his first such credit for the series . In developing Fringe , the co @-@ creators did not want to make the series too serialized , as this was a complaint often directed at Abrams ' television series <unk> . They wanted to find a balance between standalone stories and serialized content , and studied procedural dramas such as Law and Order and <unk> : Crime Scene Investigation for inspiration . <unk> explained , " While we make sure that our episodes are self @-@ contained – have a beginning , a middle , and an end – the character stories can be serialized . They don 't have to resolve themselves over the course of one show . " " The Same Old Story " was Fringe 's first regular episode , and some journalists viewed it as an example of how the series would be structured . 
 The episode was based on actual recent research and involved much collaboration among the series ' different departments . For the scene in which they remove the victim 's <unk> , the special effects crew created a mold based on actress Elizabeth Stanley 's head . Using plaster to make a prosthetic , they " drilled out the <unk> and <unk> [ ed ] it open and [ went ] through a series of molds . " Stanley stated that " it 's really cool to see the head because it really does look just like me , even though it 's very gruesome because the <unk> 's popping out . " The prop department rigged a weapon which they called a " <unk> gun " ; according to prop master Peter <unk> , this gun was based on real devices employed in airport security that look through people 's clothing for concealed weapons . VFX Supervisor Christopher <unk> explained that for the eye 's last vision , they used " a lot of actual photographic reference on the set and on the location , " which they then used to " take that imagery and composite it into the various computer monitors and displays in the lab . " 
 " The Same Old Story " was watched by 13 @.@ 272 million viewers in the United States , a 45 percent increase of four million from the pilot . Fox claimed that this ratings improvement was the best for any new network drama series in over five years . Its high @-@ rated lead @-@ in , House , helped boost Fringe 's ratings for the night , as 93 percent of House 's total audience and 95 percent of 18- to 49 @-@ year @-@ olds stayed to watch Fringe . Fringe was also the highest rated program for male 18- to 54 @-@ year @-@ olds that evening . 
 " The Same Old Story " received mixed reviews from television critics . TV Squad writer Jane <unk> thought the episode seemed " all over the place " , and wasn 't sure what to think . She stated the two most interesting parts of the episode were when Walter removed the girl 's eye in order to identity her killer , and the <unk> at the very end , when Walter states " If you 've read my file , then you know the truth about Peter 's medical history " . Travis Fickett of IGN thought it was better than the pilot ; though it was " laden with lots of <unk> <unk> and clichéd dialogue , " Fickett understood that it was needed to <unk> new viewers to the show . Fickett concluded his review by saying Fringe has the potential to be a " great show " , and he also praised the production level as " top notch " , and Torv 's performance as " very good " as she " brings a unique presence to the show " . The A.V. Club critic Noel Murray gave the episode a C + , while Television Without Pity graded it with a B. 
 Josh Jackson of Paste Magazine disliked the " <unk> ex <unk> " aspects that " <unk> solved the puzzles of the first two episodes " , and also criticized perceived " plot <unk> " like how the serial murderer immediately began aging once interrupted from killing his last victim . Despite these flaws , Jackson said he would tune in next week because he would " rather have a show <unk> on the side of unbelievable than unremarkable , and I 'm interested to see if Abrams has any more tricks up his sleeve " . Erin Fox of TV Guide also liked " The Same Old Story " better than the pilot because she thought that it " had really cool special effects , awesome Walter @-@ <unk> , and actual chemistry forming between Olivia and Peter " , and " we also got to <unk> more into the connections between Walter , Nina Sharp , Massive Dynamic and the government and the experiments they conducted before Walter was <unk> " . 
 A UGO Networks columnist was concerned that the expensive pilot would be hard to translate into weekly episodes , but " after sitting down to watch Fringe 's second episode , " The Same Old Story " , my concerns have vanished . Fringe 's second episode represents all that is holy about genre programming without <unk> any of Fringe 's eleven @-@ herbs and spices . In fact , the subtle framework of what makes Fringe not X @-@ Files is even better defined in the first weekly @-@ episode . I 'd struggled to find the word to describe it , and the winner is ' <unk> ' . " The Same Old Story " has all of the sense of mystery , discovery , and humor that the pilot had just in a smaller , more <unk> space . " Another UGO writer , Alex <unk> , later compared " The Same Old Story " to the similarly @-@ plotted The X @-@ Files episode " <unk> <unk> " . <unk> concluded that " Fringe wins this one , just for having a slightly less stupid explanation .

 The Randy Blythe <unk> case was a court case in the Czech Republic , stemming from a 2010 Lamb of God concert in Prague , wherein 19 @-@ year @-@ old fan Daniel <unk> sustained head injuries leading to a coma and subsequent death . During the investigation , Czech police unsuccessfully asked United States authorities for cooperation . When the band returned to the Czech Republic for another concert two years later , its vocalist Randy Blythe was arrested , charged with causing <unk> 's death , and <unk> in custody for five weeks . 
 According to a verdict delivered by the Municipal Court in Prague on March 5 , 2013 , it was proven that Blythe had thrown <unk> <unk> and thus had moral responsibility for his death . However , due to the circumstances , Blythe was not held <unk> liable , and most of the blame lay with <unk> and security members . The <unk> was upheld by the Prague High Court on June 5 , 2013 . 
 During a concert on May 24 , 2010 , in the Prague club , <unk> , Blythe was involved in an incident that resulted in the death of Daniel <unk> , a 19 @-@ year @-@ old attending fan . According to <unk> statements cited by the Czech online daily newspaper <unk> following Blythe 's arrest , Blythe was chanting " Come on up " between songs , which , the newspaper stated , may have been intended to invite applause from the audience and not a direct invitation to fans . The newspaper went on to report that the fan tried to climb onstage and was thrown by the singer from the stage , falling backwards directly on his head . According to the same paper , <unk> was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol , suffered serious brain trauma , fell into a coma , and died weeks later from his injuries . 
 A report about the concert at issue released on May 26 , 2010 by <unk> stated that " one of the things that was unexpected was the behavior of the singer Randall Blythe , who on a few occasions struck some fans in a relatively brutal way off the stage . " The article also contains pictures , one of them showing Blythe holding a fan down on the ground . Meanwhile , another report released two days after the concert by <unk> alleged that " Randy in a totally uncompromising way took down an <unk> fan , who has climbed the podium several times . The front @-@ man clearly showed that it is his territory , he struck the intruder down , punched him a couple of times and sent him through the air off the podium , without even stopping singing ( ! ) " On May 28 , 2010 , the report by <unk> stated that " some broken head was a testimony to the fact that the band does not like anybody on the stage " , while <unk> stated that " the only negative thing about the concert was , to say it <unk> , <unk> approach of the band towards the stage @-@ divers ... when somebody tried to climb the stage , he was brutally swept down . " 
 Following Blythe 's arrest , Tomáš <unk> , a promoter of the concert , said that there was no fight between the fan and Blythe , and that " it was an unfortunate incident which happened during the concert when someone climbed onto the stage where he was not supposed to be . " According to the Lamb of God publicist Adrenaline PR , " [ the ] incident deals with a fan that three times during the concert jumped the <unk> and rushed Randy during the performance . It is alleged that the third time , security was not able to reach him and that Randy pushed him back into the audience where supposedly he fell and hit his head . " However , it was revealed during the trial that it was a different fan who previously got into contact with Blythe than <unk> . Guitarist Willie <unk> said , " I can 't recall that particular show , let alone a fan being beaten on the stage . I think I would 've noticed something like that considering the <unk> thing . " 
 According to Blythe 's attorney Martin <unk> , the police launched an investigation following the death of <unk> , about a month after the concert and following a coma . After interviewing several <unk> from the concert , the police asked the United States Department of Justice to take part in the investigation ; however , they refused to cooperate and , <unk> , did not notify anyone from Lamb of God or its management . 
 On June 27 , 2012 , Blythe was arrested by the Czech police on suspicion of <unk> . Lamb of God was prepared to play in Prague on June 28 , 2012 , but Blythe 's arrest upon arrival at <unk> Airport caused the concert to be canceled . 
 According to TV Nova , Blythe stated that he had not been aware of <unk> 's death and expressed his remorse . 
 A police spokesperson stated on June 29 , 2012 that the police had formally charged Blythe under section 146 ( 4 ) of the Czech Criminal Code , which contains intentional <unk> of bodily harm resulting in death ( i.e. <unk> ) . He faced 5 – 10 years of imprisonment if found guilty . Randy 's brother Mark Blythe said the charge was " <unk> and <unk> and will be dropped immediately . " 
 On June 30 , 2012 , the State Attorney brought a motion to <unk> Blythe in pre @-@ trial detention , as he considered Blythe a flight risk . During a hearing conducted the same day , judge <unk> <unk> of the Prague 8 District Court ruled that Blythe will be held on <unk> , with the possibility of a bail of <unk> 4 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 ( ~ US $ 200 @,@ 000 ) , Blythe 's alleged annual income ; Blythe was held in <unk> Prison . <unk> was deposited in the court 's bank account on mid @-@ day of July 3 , 2012 . After this , the State Attorney had three working days to either accept the bail or to challenge it by filing a complaint . Due to public holidays it was not until July 9 , 2012 , that the State Attorney filed his complaint , which was to be dealt with by <unk> court , the Prague Municipal Court . 
 On July 17 , 2012 , Prague Municipal Court 's panel of three judges headed by judge <unk> <unk> overturned the bail decision by doubling the bail amount to <unk> 8 million ( ~ US $ 400 @,@ 000 ) . After this , the State Attorney challenged the conditions of release , trying to achieve that the bail is subject to Blythe staying in the country and / or Blythe having to report at a given police station regularly until the criminal proceedings are finished . On August 2 , 2012 , the <unk> court rejected the State Attorney 's second complaint and ordered Blythe 's immediate release . Blythe left the Czech Republic the next day , claiming in an interview with TV Nova that he would return for the trial . 
 On November 13 , 2012 , the spokesperson of the Prague State Attorney 's Office announced that the police had formally closed their investigation and proposed to the State Attorney to <unk> Blythe . After reviewing the case file , the State Attorney indicted Blythe on the aforementioned charges on November 30 , 2012 . Two weeks later , a judge set the trial to commence on February 4 , 2013 , with a plan to conduct the hearings in four consecutive days . Blythe was summoned to attend the hearing in person . 
 The case was heard by a panel of the Prague Municipal Court , consisting of presiding professional judge Tomáš <unk> and two lay judges . Trials in the Czech Republic are public . In general , the court is bound to decide on the deed as stated in the <unk> ; however , it is not bound by its legal assessment by the State Attorney . 
 Both the defendant and the State Attorney may appeal the decision ; the appeal would be heard by a panel of the Prague High Court , consisting of three professional judges . A decision of second instance court is final and <unk> . Nevertheless , an extraordinary appeal may be lodged by the defendant or the Supreme State Attorney , which would be heard by the Supreme Court of the Czech Republic in <unk> ; an extraordinary appeal may , however , rest only on issues of law and does not provide for full review of the case . After exhausting all of these <unk> , the defendant may also <unk> a petition to the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic . The petition may be based on allegation of violation of rights under the Czech Constitution and Charter of <unk> Rights and Basic <unk> . 
 Randy Blythe was represented by Prague lawyers Martin <unk> and <unk> <unk> . <unk> studied law at the Faculty of Law of Charles University and at the New York University . From 1990 to 1992 , he served as external advisor of the then Prime Minister <unk> <unk> . A former partner at Baker & <unk> , <unk> established <unk> & Co. in 1996 . He is also a member of board of directors of <unk> 2000 . 
 The trial started on February 4 , 2013 . Blythe testified that when he wanted to see the club before the concert , Lamb of God 's <unk> told him that the club was terrible and <unk> . According to Blythe , the <unk> went on , saying that the stage was small , there were too many people , and that it was rather dangerous . 
 Blythe , who is <unk> , took off his glasses before entering the stage , which together with the smoke and light effects allegedly left him half @-@ blind . Blythe said that people could easily reach the band members or climb up to the stage . One of the fans , who was identified as Milan <unk> by Czech newspapers , and who was scheduled to testify later during the proceedings , managed to climb the stage twice without being stopped by security . Blythe testified that during the first attempt , <unk> rushed the stage and started waving his arms before stage diving . The second time , he tried to put his arms around Blythe in an attempt to <unk> him . Blythe , who according to his own words perceived this as a danger , caught <unk> 's collar , pushed him on the ground , <unk> on him and repeatedly told him to stop . He then led the fan by his hair to the edge of the stage , where the fan jumped off . It was only after watching a video of the incident that Blythe found out that a security officer was actually pushing the fan from back . Blythe further said that he saw <unk> trying to reach the stage yet again before finally being stopped by security . 
 Later , when another fan tried to climb the stage , Blythe thought that it was <unk> again . Blythe testified that he approached the fan and pushed him with both hands out of the stage in the belief that the crowd would catch him , which it did not . <unk> <unk> , author of video which caught the previous incidents with <unk> , testified that the fan was for a moment lying on the ground with nobody helping him . Blythe further commented that he saw the fan get up and that other fans showed him <unk> up . Blythe insisted that he never saw <unk> nor came into contact with him . It was not until the arrest two years later that he found out about <unk> 's death . 
 Blythe further testified that he was not under the influence of alcohol during the concert and that he had never used any drugs . Chris <unk> , Lamb of God 's drummer , testified that he had not seen anything from the back of the stage and further proclaimed that Blythe 's aggressiveness is only a stage act . According to <unk> , Blythe is a calm , moderate , and well @-@ read person . The defense also presented videos from various Lamb of God concerts in order to demonstrate that metal music is very energetic and that Blythe regularly cheers to the crowd , but not to encourage people to climb the stage . 
 Blythe also alleged that after learning about <unk> 's death , he had written a letter to the <unk> family , in which he offered help and a meeting in @-@ person . Daniel <unk> 's father , however , testified that the family has not been contacted by anyone from the band nor by the defense team . <unk> 's father confirmed that his son had been healthy up until the day of the incident . The <unk> family 's representative brought a claim for damages in the amount of <unk> 10 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 ( <unk> . US $ <unk> @,@ 000 ) . 
 <unk> , eight witnesses delivered their testimonies on February 5 , 2013 . Among them were friends of Daniel <unk> . <unk> and three friends had come to attend the concert from <unk> , a town in mountains some 130 kilometres ( 81 mi ) northwest of Prague . They described <unk> as a huge fan of Lamb of God who had been able to secure an <unk> from a guitar player before the concert had started . 
 <unk> 's friend Jan <unk> testified that <unk> climbed the stage , and as he turned around towards the crowd he was pushed by Blythe off the stage . He said he was " 100 % sure Blythe pushed <unk> with both hands . " He further said that Blythe 's behavior <unk> from all the concerts he had attended in the past , commenting that Blythe was visibly furious . He further claimed that <unk> was not the first person to be chased off the stage by Blythe , with another fan being kicked , choked and receiving a punch from Blythe . <unk> corroborated Blythe 's testimony that Blythe asked " Are you okay ? " after <unk> fell and that the crowd gave him a positive reply . However , as <unk> fell sick after the concert , they called him an ambulance . According to <unk> , the band had not warned the fans against getting on stage and the security guards did not pay much attention to it . 
 Another person to testify was Robert <unk> , who worked as a security guard the night of the incident . <unk> said that the <unk> was too close to the stage , but not so close as to make a platform for climbing the stage . He testified that he pulled one person off the stage and that another person fell off before he could be secured . He further said that the fan 's fall might have been helped by someone else , perhaps the singer , though he did not see it precisely . 
 Blythe 's defense team attacked differences between the testimonies the witnesses gave after the incident in 2010 and at the court . Among other things , one of the witnesses originally alleged that <unk> and Blythe shook hands or that one of them offered hand to another on stage ; however , at the court hearing , he testified that there was no prior contact between them . Blythe also argued that video evidence shown in court refuted claims about his aggressive behavior . 
 Milan <unk> , the fan whom Blythe admitted to <unk> off the stage , testified on the third day of the trial . <unk> said he climbed the stage twice in order to stage dive ; he changed his mind during the third attempt to get on stage . <unk> testified that Blythe knocked him down , <unk> on him and held him down for a moment , but Blythe definitely did not <unk> him . He also admitted that taking into account the fact that he ( <unk> ) was drunk and the way he acted , Blythe 's reaction was adequate . He commented that he grasped the fact that he was not wanted on stage . 
 Another witness who had attended the concert at the rear of the crowd testified that Blythe 's behavior was standard to metal concerts , saying that metal bands always put on angry and tough acts and the concert at issue was no exception . She said that it was evident that Blythe did not want any fans on the stage . Neither the two nor any other witness who took the stand that day gave a testimony as to the moment of <unk> 's fall at the end of the concert . 
 The judge also read a sworn statement from <unk> 's former producer , who stated that she had not known about the incident . She was aware that an ambulance was called that evening , but learned about the reasons for that only later , during the police investigation . The court further heard that Lamb of God had sent a list of security demands to the concert venue , including that barriers should be placed 1 @.@ 5 metres ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) from the stage . <unk> Tomáš <unk> testified that although this was not the case , the band had not expressed any concerns to him either before or after the concert . 
 Randy Blythe was called again to the stand that day . The judge first alerted him that he had the right to remain silent and can deny answering his questions . The judge went again through the Blythe 's testimony and , with a view to the previous witness statements , asked Blythe whether he insists that it was Milan <unk> whom Blythe threw off the stage . Blythe responded by saying : " To the best of my knowledge , it was Milan <unk> who was coming up [ on stage ] every time . " 
 Also that day , expert medical witness <unk> <unk> took the stand . According to The Prague Post , <unk> testified that <unk> 's cause of death was pneumonia resulting from a blow to the <unk> . <unk> added that the " mortality rate from this kind of injury is around 40 percent , and that doctors couldn 't have done more to save the patient . " <unk> was initially taken to a nearby hospital less than a kilometer from the venue , where the initial diagnosis took place . Since this hospital did not have a specialized <unk> department , <unk> was transferred to another hospital after the diagnosis . There , <unk> underwent two operations , first to tend to the injury and second to reduce pressure on brain by removing some bone . 
 Finally , defense asked for <unk> as a key witness fell ill . The court decided to continue with the hearings the next day , after which the hearings would be <unk> until March 4 , 2013 , in order to hear the defense 's witness . Blythe committed to return when the trial resumed . 
 On February 7 , 2013 , only one witness took the stand before the hearing was <unk> . <unk> <unk> contacted the defense after reading about the trial in newspapers because he " didn 't like the description of the situation " by the previous witnesses . He said he did not think Blythe was aggressive that night , and that fans should realize any aggressive behavior displayed onstage is just part of the show . He also said that each time somebody got on the stage , Blythe demonstrated that they were not allowed there . <unk> testified that he saw how a fan tried to reach the stage three times and that as he was preparing to stage dive , somebody aided his fall from behind . He had not seen anybody fall directly on the ground . <unk> had trouble recalling details from the show , as he had visited multiple concerts on other dates in <unk> , and thus could not describe , among other things , the position of the <unk> . 
 The trial resumed on March 4 , 2013 with testimonies from expert witnesses in the fields of criminal psychology ( <unk> <unk> , appointed by the court ) and <unk> ( <unk> <unk> , appointed by the defense ) . Blythe returned to attend the hearings in person , even though the presiding judge had told him that at this point they may be undertaken in his absence . The two expert witnesses agreed that Blythe is not aggressive ; nevertheless , he may have issues with controlling his emotions under stress . The court further heard testimonies from two <unk> . One of them was a bodyguard who was present at the concert but did not see the fall . He testified that when by the exit , he saw two men taking a third man out of the building to fresh air . He said that he was told by them that the person fell off the stage . The ambulance arrived 5 – 10 minutes later . 
 Another <unk> was a fan , <unk> <unk> , who testified that she saw Blythe <unk> <unk> , saying " [ h ] e climbed onto the stage , and when he tried to stand up , Blythe <unk> him . " According to her , the <unk> was strong enough for <unk> to fall behind the front row of the fans into a place where no fans were staying at the moment . She testified that <unk> fell backwards . Another <unk> of the concert who took the stand that day did not recall seeing any fall by the end of the concert . 
 A defense @-@ appointed expert witness in the field of <unk> testified on March 5 that <unk> could not turn 180 degrees during the fall and that should he be falling forward , he could not have sustained an injury to the back of his head . He further said that if <unk> fell over the first row of the fans , he must have been not only pushed , but must have jumped himself . The State Attorney immediately attacked this testimony , claiming that the expert witness omitted the conditions at the place and time , as well as some of the <unk> testimonies , according to which <unk> fell onto his back from the beginning and did not turn during the fall . The presiding judge agreed with the State Attorney on some of his points . 
 In his closing speech , the State Attorney asked the court to <unk> Blythe for 5 years , claiming that " even children in the kindergarten are aware that a fall from height may lead to an injury . " 
 A <unk> family representative said that based on the witness testimonies , the family did not believe that Blythe was solely responsible . He continued that he would not be <unk> the requested amount , as no money could replace the loss the family has suffered . He further added that Daniel had died on his father 's birthday , and his mother has consequently become a <unk> patient unable to work . 
 In his closing word , Blythe said that he did not wish to avoid any responsibility and that if he felt guilty he would have pleaded so . He further commented that in case of <unk> , measures would be undertaken to avoid anything similar from happening at Lamb of God concerts again . 
 On March 5 , 2013 , the court delivered a verdict , according to which Blythe was not <unk> liable for <unk> 's death , even though he had the moral responsibility for it . Consequently , the court dismissed the damages claim and ordered the return of Blythe 's bail . 
 The court held that it was proven that Blythe had thrown <unk> off the stage . However , Blythe , due to his <unk> , could have mistaken <unk> for the other fan who had repeatedly gotten over the <unk> . According to the court , the largest part of the blame lies with the <unk> and security members . Judge <unk> further <unk> Blythe for not having met with the <unk> family . 
 The State Attorney 's appeal was heard by a panel of three judges of the Prague High Court , chaired by judge <unk> <unk> . The hearing took place in Blythe 's absence . Blythe 's <unk> was upheld by the panel on June 5 , 2013 . 
 The verdict may have been appealed by the Supreme State Attorney ( <unk> ) to the Supreme Court . As the appeal hasn 't been lodged by <unk> within two months of the delivery of written second instance verdict , it has become final . 
 In 2015 Blythe demanded ca <unk> 15 millions for damages but the Municipal Court for Prague 2 dismissed the suit . 
 In reaction to the arrest and detention , a fan created a petition at the official White House petition site . By the time Blythe was released on bail , it gathered over 27 @,@ 500 signatures . 
 On July 7 , 2012 , there was a vigil organized in Lamb of God 's hometown of Richmond , Virginia , by a friend of Blythe 's . At the event , <unk> ( who are also from Richmond ) frontman Dave <unk> said : “ I don ’ t think it was right for him to be arrested . I don ’ t think it was right for him to be locked up .... This stuff could have all been worked out <unk> or legally before he got there . ” In addition to <unk> , other notable figures in heavy metal , such as Tom Araya and David <unk> , have also come out in support of Blythe . 
 In a post to his blog , Blythe explained that he met the <unk> family in private after the trial , and promised them to be " a spokesperson for safer shows " . He emphasized that the family never attacked him and " just wanted to know the truth of what had happened to their son " . 
 US Highway 2 ( US 2 ) is a component of the United States <unk> Highway System that connects Everett , Washington , to the Upper Peninsula ( UP ) of the US state of Michigan , with a separate segment that runs from <unk> Point , New York , to <unk> , Maine . In Michigan , the highway runs through the UP in two segments as a part of the state trunkline highway system , entering the state at <unk> and ending at St. Ignace ; in between , US 2 briefly traverses the state of Wisconsin . As one of the major transportation <unk> in the UP , US 2 is a major conduit for traffic through the state and neighboring northern Midwest states . Two sections of the roadway are included as part of the Great Lakes Circle <unk> , and other segments are listed as state @-@ designated Pure Michigan <unk> . There are several memorial highway designations and historic bridges along US 2 that date to the <unk> and 1920s . The highway runs through rural sections of the UP , passing through two national and two state forests in the process . 
 The route of what became US 2 was used as part of two Indian trails before European settlers came to the UP , and as part of the Michigan segments of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway and the King 's International Highway auto trails in the early 20th century . The state later included these trails as part of M ‑ 12 when the first state highway <unk> were designated in 1919 . Most of M ‑ 12 was redesignated as part of US 2 when the US Highway System was created on November 11 , 1926 . Since the 1930s , several changes have <unk> the highway 's routing through the UP . One such alteration eventually created a business loop that connected across the state line with Hurley , Wisconsin , and others pushed an originally inland routing of US 2 closer to the Lake Michigan shoreline . With the creation of the Interstate Highway System , part of US 2 was rerouted to coincide with the new Interstate 75 ( I ‑ 75 ) , though in the 1980s , the U.S. Highway was truncated and removed from the I ‑ 75 freeway , resulting in today 's basic form . 
 According to a 2006 regional planning committee report , US 2 is a key highway for Michigan , providing its main western gateway . The roadway plays " an important role in the transportation of goods across the northern tier of states in the Midwest " , and is listed on the National Highway System ( NHS ) for its entire length . The NHS is a network of roadways important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility . Together with M ‑ 28 , US 2 is part of a pair of primary <unk> that bridge the eastern and western sides of the UP . The 305 @.@ 151 miles ( 491 @.@ <unk> km ) of roadway in Michigan is divided into a 109 @.@ 177 @-@ mile ( 175 @.@ 703 km ) western segment and a 195 @.@ <unk> @-@ mile ( 315 @.@ 390 km ) eastern segment , interrupted by a section that runs for 14 @.@ 460 miles ( 23 @.@ 271 km ) in the state of Wisconsin . 
 US 2 enters Michigan from Wisconsin for the first time north of downtown Hurley , Wisconsin , and <unk> , Michigan , over the state line that runs along the Montreal River . The highway crosses the river into <unk> County and passes a welcome center on the way into a commercial district north of downtown . Running along <unk> Drive , US 2 meets its only business route in Michigan at Douglas Boulevard . The business route was previously a full loop that ran west through downtown <unk> and crossed the border into Hurley and back to the main highway . The Wisconsin Department of Transportation has removed the signage on their side of the border , which reduced the loop to a business spur that ends at the state line . US 2 continues eastward through UP woodlands to the city of <unk> . While bypassing the community of Ramsay , the highway crosses a branch of the Black River . The roadway enters Wakefield on the south side of Sunday Lake , meeting M ‑ 28 at a <unk> in town . As the US Highway leaves Wakefield , it turns southeasterly through the Ottawa National Forest , crossing Jackson Creek and two branches of the <unk> Isle River . US 2 and M ‑ 64 merge and run concurrently over the second branch of the <unk> Isle in the community of <unk> . This concurrency has the lowest traffic volume along the entire length of the highway within the state ; in 2010 the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) recorded a daily average usage along the stretch of 770 vehicles , compared to the overall average of 5 @,@ 188 vehicles for the highway . At the end of the concurrency , M ‑ 64 turns northerly to run along Lake <unk> . 
 US 2 leaves the Ottawa National Forest at Iron River , and the highway continues eastward through forest lands near several small lakes to Crystal Falls , the county seat of Iron County . On the west side of town , US 2 meets US 141 ; the two highways run concurrently along Crystal Avenue . The combined highway turns south onto 5th Street and meets M ‑ 69 's eastern terminus at the intersection between 5th Street and Superior Avenue next to the county <unk> at the top of the hill . US 2 / US 141 runs south out of Crystal Falls to the west of , and parallel to , the <unk> River . The roadway passes Railroad , Kennedy and <unk> lakes and leaves the state of Michigan at the <unk> River , crossing into Florence County , Wisconsin for about 14 miles ( 23 km ) . 
 In <unk> County , the environment takes on a more agricultural character along US 2 . The highway passes through the edge of the community of <unk> before entering Powers . US 2 comes to a three @-@ way intersection and turns northeast merging onto US 41 . The concurrent highway runs from Powers through the communities of Wilson and <unk> on the south side of the <unk> Railway . At Harris , the trunkline enters the <unk> Indian Community . Harris is on the <unk> County side of the reservation , but as the highway continues east , it crosses over to <unk> River on the Delta County side . The county line in between not only separates the two communities , but also serves as the boundary between the Central and Eastern time zones . East of <unk> River , the highway crosses the community 's namesake waterway before intersecting the eastern terminus of M ‑ 69 . The roadway crosses the Ford River prior to turning due east into the outskirts of <unk> . 
 US 2 / US 41 <unk> to four lanes along <unk> Street , which forms the east – west axis of the <unk> street grid . Near downtown , the highway meets M ‑ 35 , which runs along the city 's north – south axis , Lincoln Avenue . The <unk> merge and run north , bypassing the traditional central business district for a different business corridor . Lincoln Avenue runs north carrying four lanes of traffic past the Upper Peninsula State <unk> , site of one of the two state <unk> for the state of Michigan , the only state to have twin <unk> . US 2 / US 41 / M ‑ 35 continues north on Lincoln Avenue past the campus of Bay de <unk> Community College . The four @-@ lane highway crosses the <unk> River just upstream from its mouth near the large Mead Paper Mill and shifts to run immediately next to Little Bay de <unk> . The section here carried the highest traffic counts along all of US 2 in the state : an average of 23 @,@ 977 vehicles used this segment of roadway daily in 2011 . 
 The road turns inland again , and US 2 / US 41 / M ‑ 35 passes to the west of downtown Gladstone . The highway through here is an expressway , four lanes divided by a central median and no <unk> access . Unlike a freeway , the expressway has standard intersections and not interchanges . The highway intersects the eastern terminus of County Road 426 ( CR 426 ) and crosses the <unk> Railroad south of the <unk> for 4th Avenue North , where M ‑ 35 separates from the US Highways and turns to the northwest . The expressway continues north parallel to the <unk> Railway , crossing the Days River . Through this area , the trunkline carries a speed limit of 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) for car traffic . This is the only road in the UP with a speed limit higher than 55 mph ( 89 km / h ) besides I @-@ 75 , which has a speed limit of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) . The expressway segment runs around the upper end of Little Bay de <unk> before ending at Rapid River . In this location , US 41 separates to the north , and US 2 returns to an easterly track as a two @-@ lane road , crossing the Rapid and <unk> rivers and turning southeast around the head of the bay . As US 2 crosses southern Delta County , it passes through the western unit of the <unk> National Forest . Near Garden Corners , the highway runs along the shore of Big Bay de <unk> . After the intersection with the northern terminus of M ‑ 183 , US 2 turns inland cutting across the base of the Garden Peninsula and enters Schoolcraft County . 
 In 1701 , the first transportation routes through what became the state of Michigan were the lakes , rivers and Indian trails . Two of these trails followed parts of the future US 2 . The <unk> – Green Bay Trail roughly followed the Lake Michigan shoreline routing of US 2 between <unk> and St. Ignace . The Mackinac Trail connected St. Ignace with <unk> <unk> . Marie . 
 In the age of the auto trail , the roads that later formed US 2 through the UP were given a few different highway names . When the original roadways between <unk> and Iron River were completed in late 1915 , the Upper Peninsula Development Bureau ( <unk> ) named the area <unk> and the highway the <unk> Trail . Later the name was extended over the highway to <unk> , and to all highways in the area in the early 1920s ; the name was phased out by the <unk> completely in 1927 . The roadways were also used for the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway , named for former US president Theodore Roosevelt after his death in 1919 . Overall , this highway ran from Portland , Oregon , to Portland , Maine , by way of Michigan and the Canadian province of Ontario . Through the UP , the southern branch followed the immediate predecessors to US 2 , including the section through Florence County , Wisconsin . 
 The Great Lakes Automobile Route was established in 1917 by the <unk> . A predecessor of the Great Lakes Circle <unk> by seventy years , the route followed " a circular journey along the banks of lakes Michigan and Superior and Green Bay ... " This route followed the modern US 2 from <unk> to the M ‑ 94 junction in <unk> , using the modern M ‑ 69 and M ‑ 95 to stay in Michigan . <unk> of the route followed US 41 and M ‑ 35 between Powers and <unk> . The route was originally intended to entice motorists to drive around Lake Michigan . The name fell out of use before its first anniversary because of World War I. 
 One Canadian auto trail was routed through the UP as well . In 1920 , the King 's International Highway linked Vancouver , British Columbia , to Halifax , Nova Scotia , but there was no highway to carry it around the north side of Lake Superior . <unk> had to ship their cars by boat between <unk> <unk> . Marie , Ontario , and Thunder Bay or enter the United States to continue along the auto trail . The <unk> varied on the maps of the time , but its basic route used US 2 through the UP from <unk> to <unk> <unk> . Marie until a highway north of Lake Superior was opened in 1960 ; by that time , the auto trail had taken on the Trans @-@ Canada Highway name . 
 The first state trunkline highway designated along the path of the modern US 2 was M ‑ 12 , a designation that was in use by July 1 , 1919 , between <unk> and <unk> <unk> . Marie . The first roadside park in the country was created by Herbert <unk> near what is now US 2 near Iron River in 1919 – 20 , although other sources state that the first was a picnic table alongside US 16 ( Grand River Avenue ) in 1929 south of <unk> . When the US Highway System was created on November 11 , 1926 , US 2 partially replaced M @-@ 12 . Between Crystal Falls and Iron Mountain , US 2 was routed through Florence , Wisconsin . The former routing of M ‑ 12 from Crystal Falls to <unk> became a new M ‑ 69 when the former M ‑ 69 became US 102 ( now US 141 ) . M ‑ 12 from <unk> south to Iron Mountain was made a part of an extended M ‑ 45 , which is now M ‑ 95 . By the next year , M ‑ 48 was added along US 2 from <unk> to <unk> as part of a larger extension . 
 The first changes to the routing of US 2 itself were made in 1930 with a bypass of downtown <unk> . A larger <unk> was completed in 1933 between Rogers Park and <unk> <unk> . Marie . The new routing followed Mackinac Trail instead of turning east to <unk> and north to <unk> <unk> . Marie ; the former routing was given the M ‑ 121 designation . Another realignment in the Iron Mountain area shifted US 2 / US 141 to a new bridge over the <unk> River between 1932 and 1934 . Downtown <unk> was bypassed in 1934 , and the former route was initially designated M ‑ 54 . 
 The Michigan State Highway Department ( MSHD ) changed the <unk> and designations of the highways around <unk> , Thompson and <unk> in the mid @-@ 1930s . The agency rerouted US 2 between <unk> and M ‑ 149 in Thompson , turning the old road back to county control . The section between M ‑ 149 and M ‑ 125 was redesignated as an extension of M ‑ 149 to Thompson , and M ‑ 125 was replaced by a further extension of M ‑ 149 . The last change was to route US 2 along its current alignment in the area , completing the changes on August 2 , 1936 . 
 The MSHD started construction in 1936 on a new road that rerouted US 2 into St. Ignace for the first time . Between <unk> and <unk> , US 2 previously followed Worth Road inland to the <unk> Trail to meet the northern extension of US 31 into the Upper Peninsula . The new routing took US 2 along the <unk> into St. Ignace . US 31 was truncated to the state ferry docks in Mackinaw City and US 2 was routed through St. Ignace along the former US 31 to Rogers Park ; the connection in St. Ignace to the state ferry docks became M ‑ 122 . Further changes in the early 1940s <unk> the roadway out near <unk> and Crystal Falls . 
 Additional <unk> were completed by the MSHD to move US 2 to its modern <unk> routing between Gould City and <unk> in 1941 . The new highway traveled due east from Gould City to <unk> and then along the lake to <unk> . The former route through <unk> was turned back to local control as far east as <unk> . From there east , it was numbered just M ‑ 48 , removing US 2 from a concurrency . Another former section into <unk> was added to extend M ‑ 117 . The new highway was <unk> around the Cut River Bridge until it was completed in 1946 after construction delays over steel shortages during World War II . 
 The western end of US 2 took on two changes in the 1940s . M ‑ 28 was extended along US 2 to the state line at <unk> from its western terminus at Wakefield . A similar extension was made from M ‑ 28 's eastern terminus to <unk> <unk> . Marie in 1948 . The M ‑ 54 designation was renumbered as Business US 2 by 1945 . The eastern M ‑ 28 extension was reversed in 1950 , and the western extension to the state line was shifted to a new location by 1952 . 
 With the coming of the Interstate Highway System in Michigan , the MSHD planned to convert the eastern section of US 2 to a freeway between St. Ignace and <unk> St. Marie . In planning maps from 1947 , this highway corridor was included in the system that later became the <unk> . It was also included in the General Location of National System of Interstate Highways Including All Additional Routes at Urban Areas <unk> in September 1955 , or Yellow Book after the cover color , that was released in 1955 as the federal government <unk> plans for the freeway system . The proposed number in 1958 was Interstate 75 ( I ‑ 75 ) . 
 The Department of State Highways expanded US 2 / US 41 into an expressway between Gladstone and Rapid River in 1971 . The state built a new bridge over the <unk> River in 1983 , bypassing downtown . MDOT disposed of the former routing of US 2 into downtown in two ways . The western half was initially an unnumbered state highway until it was later transferred to local control . An extension of M ‑ 94 replaced the remainder , including the <unk> Bridge , through downtown . In that same year , the department truncated US 2 to end in St. Ignace by removing it from the I ‑ 75 freeway . The last changes were made to US 2 's routing through Iron River in 1998 , bypassing the bridge that formerly carried the highway over the river in town . In 2011 , MDOT raised the speed limit along the expressway section in Delta County from 55 to 65 mph ( 89 to 105 km / h ) , although the speed limit for trucks remains 55 mph ( 89 km / h ) . 
 On July 1 , 1924 , the State Administrative Board named M ‑ 12 , the predecessor to US 2 in Michigan , the <unk> Highway to honor Frank P. <unk> , a prominent local citizen who later served in Congress from 1927 to 1933 . In 1929 , the residents of <unk> created a memorial to the veterans of World War I called Memory Lane . The project consisted of <unk> and maple trees planted along US 2 / US 41 west of town . The American Legion sold the trees to local businesses and individuals who could honor specific soldiers . Later in 1949 , the <unk> Women 's Club created a tribute in the form of a permanent living memorial to the area veterans . Also called Memory Lane , the group planted 140 <unk> and 1 @,@ 840 <unk> , trees and shrubs as a <unk> parkway along 2 @.@ 3 miles ( 3 @.@ 7 km ) of US 2 east of <unk> . 
 Most of US 2 , along with US 23 in the Lower Peninsula , was designated the United Spanish War Veterans Memorial Highway in 1949 . To connect the gap in the routing where US 2 cuts through Wisconsin , M ‑ 95 and M ‑ 69 were used in place of US 2 between Iron Mountain and Crystal Falls . Signs marking the highway were not erected until 1968 when Governor George W. Romney had them installed . 
 The <unk> Memorial Drive designation was created for the section of US 2 / US 41 / M ‑ 35 between the northern <unk> city limits and County Road 426 ( CR 426 ) in Delta County . The American Veterans ( <unk> ) organization in Michigan petitioned the Michigan Legislature to grant this designation , which was assigned under Public Act 144 in 1959 . 
 Two sections of US 2 are part of the overall Great Lakes Circle Tour ( <unk> ) : the segment from the Wisconsin state line near <unk> to the M ‑ 28 junction in Wakefield is part of the Lake Superior Circle Tour ( <unk> ) , and the segment from the southern M ‑ 35 junction in <unk> to the eastern terminus in St. Ignace is part of the Lake Michigan Circle Tour ( <unk> ) . These two tours were created in May 1986 through a joint effort between MDOT and its counterparts in Wisconsin , Minnesota and Ontario . The section of US 2 between Iron River and Crystal Falls has been named the Iron County Heritage Trail . This Pure Michigan Byway was designated to honor the " rich history of two industries that built a state and nation : mining and logging . " On August 26 , 2007 , MDOT announced that the section of US 2 that runs concurrently with M ‑ 35 in Delta County was being included in the UP <unk> Coast Recreational Heritage Trail . 
 There are six bridges along current or former sections of US 2 that MDOT has added to its listing of Michigan 's Historic Bridges ; two of these are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places ( <unk> ) . A third bridge added to the <unk> in late 2012 has not been added to MDOT 's listing however . The first of these historic bridges is the crossing of the Iron River , which has since been bypassed by a new bridge . The original structure , dating to 1918 , is a 55 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 17 m ) <unk> arch span that was built by the MSHD as Trunk Line Bridge No. 191 . The structure was listed on the <unk> on December 9 , 1999 , for its architectural and engineering significance . 
 In December 2012 , the National Park Service approved the listing of the Upper Twin Falls Bridge that crosses the <unk> River northwest of Iron Mountain . The structure is a single @-@ span , pin @-@ connected , <unk> , through @-@ <unk> bridge , and it is the only known example of its type in Michigan . It was built between 1909 and 1910 because the Twin Falls Power Dam would flood an existing river crossing . The span cost $ 5 @,@ 106 ( equivalent to $ 780 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) , paid equally by Dickinson and Florence counties . Until the 1930s , the Upper Twin Falls Bridge carried US 2 across the <unk> River . In 1934 , a new bridge was built about a mile downstream , and the highway was rerouted over the new span . The bridge closed to automobile traffic in September 1971 , and the nomination process for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places began in 2012 . 
 In 2003 , MDOT replaced the Sturgeon River Bridge in <unk> Township , Dickinson County . As of October 2011 , even though the old bridge was demolished and replaced , MDOT retained it on their historic bridge list . It was built in 1929 . 
 The Cut River Bridge carries US 2 across the Cut River in <unk> Township , Mackinac County . This structure was built during World War II but completion was delayed due to war @-@ induced steel shortages . The span uses <unk> short tons ( <unk> long tons ; <unk> t ) of structural steel to bridge the <unk> feet ( 195 m ) over the river and its <unk> at a height of 147 feet ( 45 m ) above the river . The Cut River Bridge is one of only two <unk> deck <unk> bridges in the state . On either side of the bridge , there are picnic areas and trails down to the river . 
 Listed on the <unk> on December 17 , 1999 , the Mackinac Trail – <unk> River Bridge carries H @-@ 63 , the modern successor to US 2 , over the <unk> River north of St. Ignace . The bridge is another <unk> arch structure 60 feet ( 18 m ) in length and built in 1920 . Increasing traffic along Mackinac Trail prompted the MSHD to " widen its deck by five feet [ 1 @.@ 5 m ] and install new <unk> in the 1929 – 1930 <unk> " along with the addition of decorative retaining walls . 
 The last of the historic bridges along a former segment of US 2 is the structure carrying <unk> Street ( BS I ‑ 75 ) over the Power Canal in <unk> <unk> . Marie . Built in 1934 , it is one of only three steel arch bridges in the state . The 42 @-@ foot @-@ wide ( 13 m ) and 257 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 78 m ) structure is described by MDOT as " massive " with an " innovative " construction method : the previous structure was used as a <unk> for the current bridge before removal . 
 MDOT has erected <unk> along the two Michigan segments of the highway that use the total <unk> starting at the state line in <unk> ; the signs on the eastern segment reflect the <unk> in Florence County , Wisconsin . 
 Business U.S. Highway 2 ( Bus . US 2 ) is a 1 @.@ 270 @-@ mile ( 2 @.@ <unk> km ) business route that runs from the Wisconsin state line at the Montreal River . The route extends through downtown <unk> on Silver and Aurora streets before turning northward along Suffolk Street . Bus . US 2 stays on Suffolk Street for a short while until it turns onto Frederick Street . On Frederick Street , Bus . US 2 bears north through a residential area along Douglas Street . The eastern terminus of the route is at its junction with US 2 at the corner of <unk> Drive and Douglas Street north of downtown . 
 The business route was created in August 1942 when former M ‑ 54 in <unk> was renumbered as a business loop of US 2 . It was originally a bi @-@ state business connection before the Wisconsin Department of Transportation decommissioned Bus . US 2 in Hurley westward along State Trunk Highway 77 and northward along US 51 in 2002 . 
 The Butterfly World Tour was the third concert tour by American singer @-@ songwriter Mariah Carey . The tour promoted Carey 's album at the time , Butterfly ( 1997 ) , and included songs from several of her previous albums . The tour visited Asia , Australia and the United States , with rehearsals taking place in December 1997 . Starting on January 11 , 1998 the tour spanned five shows in Asia , six in Australia , and one in Hawaii , US . Throughout the tour , Carey varied hairstyles and outfits , as well as song selections . The Butterfly World Tour was very successful ; the four dates at Japan 's largest stadium , Tokyo <unk> , sold out in under one hour , <unk> over 200 @,@ 000 tickets , breaking the previous record she held at the stadium for show sell @-@ outs . 
 The tour was recorded in VHS format , and was titled Around the World . The video featured live performances of Carey at different worldwide venues including New York , Japan , Hawaii and Brisbane . Other scenes are included in the video such as a conversation between Carey and Brenda K. Starr prior to her performance of " I Still Believe " . Prior to the performances in Australia , a scene of Carey swimming with <unk> is shown . Additionally , Olivia Newton @-@ John makes a cameo appearance during their joint performance of Newton @-@ John 's song , " <unk> <unk> to You " . The video was commercially successful , being certified platinum in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) and gold in Brazil by the <unk> <unk> dos <unk> de <unk> ( <unk> ) . 
 The show began with Carey standing on a small elevated centerpiece on stage , surrounded by several long draped <unk> . Carey featured three background vocalists throughout the tour , Trey Lorenz , <unk> Daniels and Kelly Price . As the introduction began with " <unk> " , each of the <unk> were slowly draped , revealing Carey atop the platform , dressed in a beige mini @-@ dress and matching sheer <unk> and <unk> heels . As she began performing " <unk> " , the platform was lowered so Carey could access the other sections of the stage throughout the song 's performance . After an intimate performance with <unk> lights for " The Roof ( Back in Time ) " , Carey was joined on @-@ stage by a Peruvian guitar player , who played the Latin @-@ inspired guitar melodies during her performance of " My All " . Afterwards , Carey sang " Close My Eyes " , the only sitting performance of the show . During the song , several male backup dancers performed slow and ample dance routines behind Carey on a higher level of the stage . 
 For the second part of the show , Carey had the second costume change of the evening , donning a long <unk> black gown and semi @-@ <unk> hair . For the performance of " <unk> " , Carey was joined by three female back @-@ up dancers , who mimicked her light dance routines during the song . The next song on the set @-@ list was " Hero " , which featured Carey alone on @-@ stage , without any vocal back @-@ up . After the song 's performance , Carey was joined on @-@ stage by Lorenz , who performed " I 'll Be There " alongside her . Next came " Make It <unk> " , a song which accompanied yet another wardrobe change for Carey . She <unk> a short mini @-@ skirt , alongside a <unk> white <unk> and loose golden <unk> . On @-@ stage , Carey was joined by a full church choir , all dressed in long black garments . After the song 's <unk> , Carey performed " One Sweet Day " , alongside a previously recorded video of Boyz II Men during their live performance of the song with Carey at Madison Square Garden in 1995 . 
 <unk> the entire tour was an instant sell @-@ out ; the four shows at Japan 's largest stadium , Tokyo <unk> , broke Carey 's previous ticket @-@ sales record , selling out all 200 @,@ 000 tickets in under one hour . Additionally , the entire Australian leg sold out within hours , leading Carey to extend the tour one more date in the United States . The show at Hawaii 's 50 @,@ 000 capacity <unk> Stadium sold out as well , making her one of the few acts in the stadiums history to sell out the entire venue . Aside from its commercial success , fans and critics <unk> about the show 's visuals , as well as Carey 's vocal delivery . 
 <unk> <unk> , also known as Button 's Mill is a Grade II * listed tower mill constructed of brick . The <unk> is located at <unk> , Suffolk , England . It was built in the early nineteenth century to grind wheat into flour . <unk> <unk> worked by wind power until 1924 , <unk> on two sails , after which it became <unk> . 
 In 1979 , a group of enthusiasts purchased <unk> <unk> for restoration . Numerous volunteers helped to restore the mill to full working order over an eight @-@ year period . The mill is open to the public , and flour ground at the mill can be bought at the site . 
 The mill is a small four storey tower mill with Patent sails and <unk> by a <unk> . It drives two pairs of <unk> , with a third pair driven by an auxiliary engine . 
 The mill was restored over a period of six years . Much of the work was carried out by enthusiasts who used working holidays to repair the mill . 
 The consortium took possession of the mill in November 1979 . The first priority was to make the mill as <unk> as possible . <unk> sheets were spread on the dust floor of the mill to prevent further water penetration of the structure . The mill was surveyed and recorded . In spring 1980 , the dust floor partially collapsed and was removed as a safety measure . <unk> was erected to allow the <unk> to be dismantled , and the cap centering wheels were removed in preparation for the removal of the cap frame . 
 A two @-@ week work @-@ in was held at the end of July and beginning of August 1980 . Thirty @-@ three volunteers worked on the mill over the work @-@ in . Two new main floor beams for the dust floor were made from <unk> of pitch pine which had previously been in a <unk> at Bury St <unk> . On 3 August 1980 , the <unk> and remaining sail fragments were removed by a mobile crane , followed by the cap frame and the cast @-@ iron curb sections . 
 The work was financed by grants of £ 500 from the Council for the Preservation of Rural Essex , £ 250 from St <unk> Borough Council , £ 200 from the <unk> Trust , and £ 200 from the Suffolk Mills Group . Other donations and income amounted to £ 65 , with the balance of expenditure being met jointly by the five owners . 
 The " work @-@ in " was reported in both local and national media , including BBC Look East , Bury Free Press , Eastern Daily Press , East Anglian Daily Times , Daily Telegraph , and Radio Orwell . 
 In the 1981 season two separate work @-@ ins were held , the first from 25 July to 2 August and the second from 22 August to 30 August . A total of 37 volunteers participated over the two weeks . 
 The <unk> were removed from the stone floor , which was then repaired . One of the main beams was found to have been attacked by Death Watch beetles , and over a third of the <unk> beam was replaced with oak . The six supports for the <unk> frame were repaired one at a time , as they bore the whole of the weight of the machinery above . One post required replacement . It had <unk> and the floor had sunk by 4 inches ( 100 mm ) causing the second main floor beam to fracture . When this work had been completed , the stone floor was removed , including the second main floor beam , which was removed in one piece so that the most suitable route to install its replacement could be assessed . 
 The new main beam for the stone floor was installed and the ground floor was <unk> . The stone floor was reconstructed , reusing the old stone bearers and those <unk> that were fit for reuse . Other <unk> were made new from oak or pitch pine . New <unk> were laid in the dust floor , the 1 1 ⁄ 4 inches ( 32 mm ) thick <unk> boards being double @-@ grooved with a metal tongue between them . Those on the bin floor are of a similar configuration . The top four courses of brickwork of the mill tower were removed and work began on rebuilding them , aided by a <unk> attached to the upright shaft . 
 During the second work @-@ in , the remainder of the stone floor was boarded , again using double @-@ grooved boards with a metal tongue between them . The window on the dust floor was rebuilt and the reconstruction of the top four courses of brickwork continued . The top two courses were rebuilt with red engineering bricks . The dust floor window had a reinforced concrete <unk> cast as the tower was weak at this point and had distorted . The <unk> , the curb segments and <unk> <unk> were given two coats of red lead paint . A new <unk> for the cap was made from a piece of oak 3 feet ( 910 mm ) long by 16 inches ( 410 mm ) diameter . A start was made on removing the old pointing on the brickwork and <unk> with <unk> mortar . 
 After the work @-@ in had finished , the boarding of the stone floor was completed and the mill thoroughly cleaned in preparation for an open day which was held in late autumn . The work done in 1981 cost £ 3 @,@ 250 . <unk> received were £ 2 @,@ 000 from <unk> <unk> , £ 1 @,@ <unk> from the Historic Buildings Council and £ 130 from St <unk> Borough Council . Other donations and income received amounted to £ 70 . The project received further coverage in local media , the Eastern Daily Press , and South Norfolk News . 
 The 1982 work @-@ ins took place from 24 July to 1 August and 21 August to 29 August . The work planned included the completion of the brickwork at the top of the tower , installation of the <unk> curb , a start on the construction of the new cap , installing machinery and making and fitting various doors and windows . The cap frame was constructed , incorporating two beams from the original cap frame that were fit to be reused . The cap frame was completed in autumn 1982 . It had been constructed upside down and a mobile crane was used to turn it over and place the <unk> into position . 
 Work in the early part of 1983 was mainly confined to smaller jobs such as casting various <unk> and overhaul of the various parts of the <unk> <unk> and mechanism for controlling the Patent sails . The mill was generally made as safe as possible inside in preparation for scheduled visits , including one from the Wind and <unk> Section of the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings . Other work included the overhaul of the final drive to the 4 feet 7 inches ( 1 @.@ 40 m ) stones , including <unk> the stone nut and replacement of three <unk> in beech . 
 When the weather improved , work commenced outside . The cap circle was mostly constructed before the first work @-@ in commenced . The work @-@ ins took place over two separate weeks in July and August , with 35 people participating . During the first work @-@ in , the <unk> posts and <unk> were fitted . The oak cap ribs , which had been prefabricated <unk> were fitted and the <unk> was supported by scaffolding ready for final fitting . <unk> <unk> of oak were fitted and the <unk> was pulled into position using a <unk> . The cap frame was competed with the fitting of intermediate ribs and <unk> . The rear of the cap circle was also completed during this time . 
 After the work @-@ ins had ended , work continued on finishing the cap which was scheduled for lift @-@ on in October . The weather hampered the work initially , but the application of a modern <unk> paint , designed to withstand normal movement of the timber and yet remain <unk> , was completed in time for the lift @-@ on . A mini work @-@ in was held the weekend before the cap was lifted , with 17 people participating over the weekend . Final work was done to the cap and a new window was fitted to the stone floor of the mill . The <unk> was removed and the <unk> dismantled . The 5 @-@ ton cap was lifted into place by a mobile crane on 24 October 1983 , watched by a crowd of some 70 people . The fitting of the cap was <unk> with beer from <unk> <unk> , <unk> . 
 Restoration work in 1983 cost £ 1 @,@ <unk> . Grants were received from the Association of Independent Museums , <unk> ' Norton Women 's Institute , Ipswich Historical Transport Society , the National Association for <unk> Children , Mr D. Porter and the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings . Further income came from the sale of guide books and a drawing of the mill by <unk> <unk> . 
 Other work undertaken by the <unk> involved repairing some <unk> damage to the foundation brickwork , digging a drainage trench around the mill and moving the auxiliary engine into position . A concrete path around the tower was trapping moisture , leading to rising <unk> . A French drain was constructed around the mill to remedy these problem . A 21 horsepower ( 16 kW ) <unk> & <unk> <unk> diesel engine had been purchased in 1981 and was fitted onto a permanent concrete base with the aid of a mobile crane . After fitting it was then painted . Some missing or broken parts were made or repaired as necessary . 
 Off @-@ site , the new brake wheel and <unk> were made . The original brake wheel was too rotten to repair , and showed evidence that it had been altered from the original one installed in 1819 . The original brake wheel was 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 83 m ) diameter to allow the Common sails to run at their <unk> speed . When the mill was modernised in 1832 it was necessary to alter the gear ratios within the mill , as Patent sails run at a slower speed than Common sails . The great spur wheel was increased in diameter and the stone nuts reduced in diameter . The brake wheel was also rebuilt , with a cast iron segment ring fitted in place of the original <unk> , resulting in a wheel 7 feet 2 inches ( 2 @.@ 18 m ) in diameter . The opinion of professional <unk> was sought , and it was decided that a scaled @-@ up version of the original brake wheel would be made , but retaining the cast iron teeth segments . The remains of the original brake wheel were retained as an exhibit in the mill . The original iron segments were all broken , so a pattern was made and new segments were cast in heat @-@ treated malleable cast iron . When the brake wheel was completed it was dismantled and transported to the mill ready for <unk> . 
 The <unk> was made . Some of the small <unk> were replaced . The stocks were made from pitch pine and the <unk> from Douglas fir . Work at the mill over the winter included repairs to the brickwork and windows , with only one window still needing attention when the first work @-@ in began . New beech <unk> were fitted to the crown wheel , which was restored to its correct position on the upright shaft . 
 The stocks and sails were made during the two work @-@ ins held in July and August , a total of 41 people attending over the two weeks . A second @-@ hand stock had been bought in the 1920s and preserved at the mill , but upon examination it was found to be unfit for use . Thus two new stocks were required instead of one . Modern steel stocks had already been discounted on cost and <unk> grounds , leaving two options . Traditional stocks made from a single piece of timber , or <unk> stocks . Good quality pitch pine was not <unk> in the lengths required . Douglas fir was <unk> in such lengths but was discounted on strength and <unk> grounds . A Douglas fir stock on a nearby mill had <unk> after only seven years . Thus it was decided that <unk> stocks would be made . 
 The 52 feet ( 15 @.@ 85 m ) long stocks were made from Douglas fir . All timber had been pressure treated with <unk> and well <unk> . It was estimated that a <unk> stock would be up to 20 % stronger than a similar stock of solid timber . The timber used was 1 1 ⁄ 2 inches ( 38 mm ) thick and nine <unk> were required at the centre , where the stock passes through the poll end of the <unk> . <unk> attention was paid to where individual joints occurred between different pieces of timber . Both stocks were made during the work @-@ in , with one of them being trimmed and finished ready for use . The stocks were the first <unk> stocks made by amateurs . 
 The four sails were made . The originals being slightly different pairs . Those on the inner stock having bays of 3 feet ( 910 mm ) pitch and those on the outer stock having bays of 3 feet 2 inches ( 970 mm ) pitch . It was decided that the new sails would be identical , at the larger pitch . Four 27 feet ( 8 @.@ 23 m ) long <unk> were cut from a <unk> of pitch pine obtained from a demolished <unk> at Bury St <unk> . The <unk> are 6 inches ( 150 mm ) square at their inner end . <unk> bars and <unk> were made from modern pitch pine , selected for quality . The <unk> for the sail bars were cut . That at the heel of the sail being at 27 ° and that at the tip being 15 ° , decreasing by 1 ½ ° at each sail bar . Three of the four sails had been completed at the end of the work in . 
 Work later in the year included the finishing of the fourth sail , balancing the <unk> and sorting out <unk> troubles with the <unk> <unk> . The brake and brake lever were made and installed and <unk> <unk> for the sails were cast . 
 Work planned for 1985 included the replacement of the dust floor window and completion of the stocks and sails . The external walls of the mill were <unk> and internal walls plastered . Two work @-@ ins were held , from 20 July to 28 July and 17 August to 26 August . Further work over the next two years saw the restoration completed in 1987 . 
 The restoration of <unk> <unk> was made possible by the efforts of 135 individuals and 61 organisations . This was achieved by the donation of labour , plant , materials or grants of money , or by giving <unk> for materials purchased or providing publicity for the project . 
 A four @-@ storey tower mill with Common sails carried on a wooden <unk> , driving two pairs of <unk> <unk> . <unk> wheel 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 83 m ) diameter . <unk> was by hand . 
 The four @-@ storey tower is built of brick , and stands 31 feet 5 inches ( 9 @.@ 58 m ) from ground level to the curb . The walls are 2 feet ( 610 mm ) thick at ground level . The mill is described from the top down . 
 The <unk> cap sits on top of the tower , giving the mill an overall height of 45 feet ( 13 @.@ 72 m ) to the <unk> . It houses the cast @-@ iron <unk> and 7 feet 2 inches ( 2 @.@ 18 m ) diameter wooden brake wheel internally . <unk> the four double Patent sails span 64 feet ( 19 @.@ 51 m ) . They are 9 feet ( 2 @.@ 74 m ) wide and can develop 30 horsepower ( 22 kW ) . The eight <unk> <unk> keeps the mill turned into wind . 
 The top floor of the mill is the dust floor . It could be used for storage of grain and gives internal access to the cap . The cast @-@ iron <unk> , which is driven by the brake wheel is carried at the top of the upright shaft , in the centre of the mill . 
 The bin floor is where the grain is stored before being ground into flour . The <unk> hoist mechanism is housed on this floor , driven from the wooden crown wheel on the floor below by belt . 
 The stone floor is where the two pairs of <unk> French Burr <unk> are located . The stones are 4 feet 4 inches ( 1 @.@ 32 m ) and 4 feet 7 inches ( 1 @.@ 40 m ) diameter . The wooden crown wheel is located towards the ceiling . This drives the <unk> hoist on the bin floor . Other machinery on this floor are an <unk> <unk> and a flour <unk> . 
 The ground floor of the mill is the meal floor . It is where the <unk> ground flour is delivered for <unk> up . The wooden great spur wheel , located at the bottom of the extended upright shaft and stone nuts are located on this floor . The great spur wheel has been converted from <unk> arm construction to <unk> arm construction . A third pair of 4 feet 6 inches ( 1 @.@ 37 m ) diameter French Burr <unk> is located on a <unk> frame , driven by the auxiliary engine via a fast and loose <unk> . 
 <unk> Mill is open to the public on Easter Monday , the Sunday of the late May and August bank holidays and the first Sunday in July , August and September . It is also open at other times by prior arrangement . 
 The episode received positive reviews , while various members of the <unk> <unk> crew consider the episode to be one of their favorites , mainly due to the satirical nature of the episode . However , the episode was not immune to negative reception , and was criticized by <unk> media group the Parents Television Council and fans , who interpreted the episode as an example of promoting and implicitly <unk> use of <unk> towards children . 
 The writing staff used their individual childhood experiences as inspirations to come up with much of the story lines for this episode . The idea for " <unk> Mouth " was inspired by creative director Derek <unk> 's experience " [ when ] I got in trouble for saying the f @-@ word in front of my mother . " <unk> said , " The scene where Patrick is running to Mr. <unk> to <unk> , with <unk> chasing him , is pretty much how it happened in real life . " The end of the episode , where Mr. <unk> uses more <unk> than <unk> and Patrick , was also inspired " by the fact that my [ <unk> 's ] mother has a sailor mouth herself . " 
 " <unk> Mouth " was released on the DVD compilation called <unk> <unk> : Sea Stories on March 12 , 2002 . It was also included in the <unk> <unk> : The Complete 2nd Season DVD released on October 19 , 2004 . On September 22 , 2009 , " <unk> Mouth " was released on the <unk> <unk> : The First 100 Episodes , alongside all the episodes of seasons one through five . 
 The military history of Australia spans the nation 's 220 @-@ year modern history , from the early Australian frontier wars between <unk> and Europeans to the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan in the early 21st century . Although this history is short when compared to that of many other nations , Australia has been involved in numerous conflicts and wars , and war and military service have been significant influences on Australian society and national identity , including the Anzac spirit . The relationship between war and Australian society has also been shaped by the enduring themes of Australian strategic culture and its unique security dilemma . 
 As British <unk> , the Australian colonies participated in Britain 's small wars of the 19th century , while later as a <unk> dominion , and then an independent nation , Australia fought in the First World War and Second World War , as well as in the wars in Korea , Malaya , Borneo and Vietnam during the Cold War . In the Post @-@ Vietnam era Australian forces have been involved in numerous international peacekeeping missions , through the United Nations and other agencies , including in the Sinai , Persian Gulf , <unk> , Somalia , East Timor and the Solomon Islands , while more recently they have also fought as part of multi @-@ lateral forces in Iraq and Afghanistan . In total , nearly 103 @,@ 000 Australians died during the course of these conflicts . 
 For most of the last century military service has been one of the single greatest shared experiences of white Australian males , and although this is now changing due to the professionalisation of the military and the absence of major wars during the second half of the 20th century , it continues to influence Australian society to this day . War and military service have been defining influences in Australian history , while a major part of the national identity has been built on an <unk> conception of the Australian experience of war and of <unk> , known as the Anzac spirit . These ideals include notions of endurance , courage , ingenuity , humour , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ; traits which , according to popular thought , defined the behaviour of Australian soldiers fighting at Gallipoli during the First World War . The Gallipoli campaign was one of the first international events that saw Australians taking part as Australians and has been seen as a key event in forging a sense of national identity . 
 The relationship between war and Australian society has been shaped by two of the more enduring themes of Australian strategic culture : <unk> with a powerful ally and expeditionary warfare . Indeed , Australian defence policy was closely linked to Britain until the Japanese crisis of 1942 , while since then an alliance with the United States has <unk> its security . <unk> , this pattern of <unk> — both for cultural reasons such as shared values and beliefs , as well as for more <unk> security concerns — has ensured that Australian strategic policy has often been defined by relations with its allies . Regardless , a tendency towards strategic <unk> has also been evident , with Australians often reluctant to think about defence issues or to <unk> resources until a crisis arises ; a trait which has historically resulted in <unk> for major military challenges . 
 From 1788 until 1870 the defence of the Australian colonies was mostly provided by British Army regular forces . Originally Marines protected the early settlements at Sydney Cove and Norfolk Island , however they were relieved of these duties in 1790 by a British Army unit specifically recruited for colonial service , known as the New South Wales Corps . The New South Wales Corps subsequently was involved in putting down a rebellion of Irish convicts at Castle Hill in 1804 . Soon however shortcomings in the corps convinced the War Office of the need for a more reliable garrison in New South Wales and Van <unk> 's Land . Chief of these shortcomings was the Rum Rebellion , a coup mounted by its officers in 1808 . As a result , in January 1810 the 73rd ( <unk> ) Regiment of Foot arrived in Australia . By 1870 , 25 British infantry regiments had served in Australia , as had a small number of artillery and engineer units . 
 Although the primary role of the British Army was to protect the colonies against external attack , no actual threat ever <unk> . The British Army was instead used in policing , guarding convicts at penal institutions , combating <unk> , putting down convict rebellions — as occurred at Bathurst in 1830 — and to suppress Aboriginal resistance to the extension of European settlement . Notably British soldiers were involved in the battle at the <unk> <unk> in 1854 on the Victorian <unk> . Members of British regiments stationed in Australia also saw action in India , Afghanistan , New Zealand and the Sudan . 
 During the early years of settlement the naval defence of Australia was provided by detached Royal Navy units of the East Indies Station , based in Sydney . However , in 1859 Australia was established as a separate squadron under the command of a <unk> , marking the first occasion that Royal Navy ships had been permanently stationed in Australia . The Royal Navy remained the primary naval force in Australian waters until 1913 , when the Australia Station ceased and responsibility handed over to the Royal Australian Navy ; the Royal Navy 's depots , dockyards and structures were given to the Australian people . 
 The reactions of the native Aboriginal inhabitants to the sudden arrival of British settlers in Australia were varied , but were inevitably hostile when the settler 's presence led to competition over resources , and to the occupation of the indigenous inhabitants ' lands . European diseases decimated Aboriginal populations , and the occupation or destruction of lands and food resources sometimes led to starvation . By and large neither the British nor the <unk> approached the conflict in an organised sense and conflict occurred between groups of settlers and individual tribes rather than systematic warfare . At times , however , the frontier wars did see the involvement of British soldiers and later mounted police units . Not all Aboriginal groups resisted white encroachment on their lands , while many <unk> served in mounted police units and were involved in attacks on other tribes . 
 Fighting between <unk> and Europeans was localised as the <unk> did not form <unk> capable of sustained resistance . As a result , there was not a single war , but rather a series of violent engagements and massacres across the continent . <unk> or disorganised however , a pattern of frontier warfare emerged with Aboriginal resistance beginning in the 18th century and continuing into the early 20th century . This warfare <unk> the popular and at times academic " myth " of peaceful settlement in Australia . Faced with Aboriginal resistance settlers often reacted with violence , resulting in a number of indiscriminate massacres . Among the most famous is the Battle of <unk> in Western Australia in 1834 . Such incidents were not officially sanctioned however , and after the <unk> Creek massacre in New South Wales in 1838 seven Europeans were hanged for their part in the killings . However , in Tasmania the so @-@ called Black War was fought between 1828 and 1832 , and aimed at driving most of the island 's native inhabitants onto a number of isolated peninsulas . Although it began in failure for the British , it ultimately resulted in considerable casualties amongst the native population . 
 Central to the success of the Europeans was the use of firearms . However , the advantages afforded by firearms have often been <unk> . Prior to the late 19th century , firearms were often <unk> muzzle @-@ loading , smooth @-@ bore , single shot <unk> with flint @-@ lock mechanisms . Such weapons produced a low rate of fire , while suffering from a high rate of failure and were only accurate within 50 metres ( 160 ft ) . These deficiencies may have initially given the <unk> an advantage , allowing them to move in close and engage with <unk> or clubs . Yet by 1850 significant advances in firearms gave the Europeans a distinct advantage , with the six @-@ shot <unk> revolver , the <unk> single shot breech @-@ loading rifle and later the <unk> @-@ Henry rifle , as well as rapid @-@ fire rifles such as the Winchester rifle , becoming available . These weapons , when used on open ground and combined with the superior mobility provided by horses to surround and engage groups of <unk> , often proved successful . The Europeans also had to adapt their tactics to fight their fast @-@ moving , often hidden enemies . Tactics employed included night @-@ time surprise attacks , and positioning forces to drive the natives off cliffs or force them to retreat into rivers while attacking from both banks . 
 The conflict lasted for over 150 years and followed the pattern of British settlement in Australia . Beginning in New South Wales with the arrival of the first Europeans in May 1788 , it continued in Sydney and its surrounds until the 1820s . As the frontier moved west so did the conflict , pushing into outback New South Wales in the 1840s . In Tasmania , fighting can be traced from 1804 to the 1830s , while in Victoria and the southern parts of South Australia , the majority of the violence occurred during the 1830s and 1840s . The south @-@ west of Western Australia experienced warfare from 1829 to 1850 . The war in Queensland began in the area around Brisbane in the 1840s and continued until 1860 , moving to central Queensland in the 1850s and 1860s , and then to northern Queensland from the 1860s to 1900 . In Western Australia , the violence moved north with European settlement , reaching the <unk> region by 1880 , with violent clashes continuing until the 1920s . In the Northern Territory conflict lasted even later still , especially in central Australia , continuing from the 1880s to the 1930s . One estimate of casualties places European deaths at 2 @,@ 500 , while at least 20 @,@ 000 <unk> are believed to have perished . Far more devastating though was the effect of disease which significantly reduced the Aboriginal population by the beginning of the 20th century ; a fact which may also have limited their ability to resist . 
 In 1861 , the Victorian ship <unk> Victoria was dispatched to help the New Zealand colonial government in its war against Māori in <unk> . Victoria was subsequently used for patrol duties and logistic support , although a number of personnel were involved in actions against Māori fortifications . One sailor died from an accidental gunshot wound during the deployment . 
 From 1870 until 1901 , each of the six colonial governments was responsible for their own defence . The colonies had gained responsible government between 1855 and 1890 , and while the Colonial Office in London retained control of some affairs , the Governor of the each colony was required to raise their own colonial militia . To do this , they were granted the authority from the British crown to raise military and naval forces . Initially these were militias in support of British regulars , but when military support for the colonies ended in 1870 , the colonies assumed their own defence responsibilities . The colonial military forces included unpaid volunteer militia , paid citizen soldiers , and a small permanent component . They were mainly infantry , cavalry and mounted infantry , and were neither housed in barracks nor subject to full military discipline . Even after significant reforms in the 1870s — including the expansion of the permanent forces to include engineer and artillery units — they remained too small and <unk> to be considered armies in the modern sense . By 1885 , the forces numbered 21 @,@ 000 men . Although they could not be compelled to serve overseas many volunteers subsequently did see action in a number conflicts of the British Empire during the 19th century , with the colonies raising <unk> to serve in Sudan , South Africa and China . 
 Despite a reputation of colonial <unk> , many of the locally raised units were highly organised , disciplined , professional , and well trained . During this period , defences in Australia mainly revolved around static defence by combined infantry and artillery , based on garrisoned coastal forts . However , by the 1890s , improved railway communications between the mainland eastern colonies led Major General James Edwards — who had recently completed a survey of colonial military forces — to the belief that the colonies could be defended by the rapid <unk> of brigades of infantry . As a consequence he called for a <unk> of defences , and defensive agreements to be made between the colonies . Edwards argued for the colonial forces to be <unk> and for professional units — obliged to serve anywhere in the South Pacific — to replace the volunteer forces . These views found support in the influential New South Wales Commandant , Major General Edward Hutton , however suspicions held by the smaller colonies towards New South Wales and Victoria <unk> the proposal . These reforms remaining unresolved however , and defence issues were generally given little attention in the debate on the political federation of the colonies . 
 With the exception of Western Australia , the colonies also operated their own navies . In 1856 , Victoria received its own naval vessel , <unk> Victoria , and its deployment to New Zealand in 1860 during the First <unk> War marked the first occasion that an Australian warship had been deployed overseas . The colonial navies were expanded greatly in the mid @-@ 1880s and consisted of a number of gunboats and torpedo @-@ boats for the defence of harbours and rivers , as well as naval brigades to man vessels and forts . Victoria became the most powerful of all the colonial navies , with the ironclad <unk> Cerberus in service from 1870 , as well as the steam @-@ sail warship HMS Nelson on loan from the Royal Navy , three small gunboats and five torpedo @-@ boats . New South Wales formed a Naval Brigade in 1863 and by the start of the 20th century had two small torpedo @-@ boats and a <unk> . The Queensland Maritime Defence Force was established in 1885 , while South Australia operated a single ship , HMCS Protector . Tasmania had also a small Torpedo Corps , while Western Australia 's only naval defences included the Fremantle Naval Artillery . Naval personnel from New South Wales and Victoria took part in the suppression of the <unk> Rebellion in China in 1900 , while HMCS Protector was sent by South Australia but saw no action . The separate colonies maintained control over their military and naval forces until Federation in 1901 , when they were amalgamated and placed under the control of the new Commonwealth of Australia . 
 During the early years of the 1880s , an Egyptian regime in the Sudan , backed by the British , came under threat from rebellion under the leadership of native Muhammad Ahmad ( or Ahmed ) , known as Mahdi to his followers . In 1883 , as part of the <unk> War , the Egyptians sent an army to deal with the revolt , but they were defeated and faced a difficult campaign of <unk> their forces . The British instructed the Egyptians to abandon the Sudan , and sent General Charles Gordon to co @-@ <unk> the evacuation , but he was killed in January 1885 . When news of his death arrived in New South Wales in February 1885 , the government offered to send forces and meet the contingent 's expenses . The New South Wales <unk> consisted of an infantry battalion of 522 men and 24 officers , and an artillery battery of 212 men and sailed from Sydney on 3 March 1885 . 
 Eventually the British government decided that the campaign in Sudan was not worth the effort required and left a garrison in <unk> . The New South Wales <unk> sailed for home on 17 May , arriving in Sydney on 19 June 1885 . Approximately 770 Australians served in Sudan ; nine subsequently died of disease during the return journey while three had been wounded during the campaign . 
 Following the defeat of the <unk> republics still the <unk> held out , forming small commando units and conducting a campaign of guerrilla warfare to disrupt British troop movements and lines of supply . This new phase of resistance led to further recruiting in the Australian colonies and the raising of the <unk> 's <unk> , with these soldiers usually being volunteers with horse @-@ riding and shooting skills , but little military experience . After Federation in 1901 , eight Australian Commonwealth Horse battalions of the newly created Australian Army were also sent to South Africa , although they saw little fighting before the war ended . Some Australians later joined local South African irregular units , instead of returning home after discharge . These soldiers were part of the British Army , and were subject to British military discipline . Such units included the <unk> <unk> which gained notoriety as the unit in which Harry " <unk> " <unk> and Peter <unk> served in before their court martial and execution for war crimes . 
 With the guerrillas requiring supplies , <unk> de la Rey lead a force of 3 @,@ 000 <unk> against <unk> , on the <unk> River in Western <unk> . The post held a large quantity of stores and was defended by 300 Australians and 200 <unk> . The attack began on 4 August 1900 with heavy shelling causing 32 casualties . During the night the defenders dug in , enduring shelling and rifle fire . A relief force was stopped by the <unk> , while a second column turned back believing that the post had already been relieved . The siege lasted 11 days , during which more than 1 @,@ 800 shells were fired into the post . After calls to surrender were ignored by the defenders , and not prepared to risk a frontal attack , the <unk> eventually retired . The Siege of <unk> River was one of the major achievements of the Australians during the war , with the post finally relieved on 16 August . 
 Australians were not always successful however , suffering a number of heavy losses late in the war . On 12 June 1901 , the 5th Victorian Mounted Rifles lost 19 killed and 42 wounded at <unk> , near <unk> after poor security allowed a force of 150 <unk> to surprise them . On 30 October 1901 , <unk> of the Scottish Horse Regiment also suffered heavy casualties at Gun Hill , although 60 <unk> were also killed in the engagement . Meanwhile , at <unk> on 4 January 1902 , the 5th Queensland Imperial <unk> lost 13 killed and 17 wounded . Ultimately the <unk> were defeated , and the war ended on 31 May 1902 . In all 16 @,@ 175 Australians served in South Africa , and perhaps another 10 @,@ 000 enlisted as individuals in Imperial units ; casualties included 251 killed in action , 267 died of disease and 43 missing in action , while a further 735 were wounded . Six Australians were awarded the Victoria Cross . 
 The <unk> Rebellion in China began in 1900 , and a number of western nations — including many European powers , the United States , and Japan — soon sent forces as part of the China Field Force to protect their interests . In June , the British government sought permission from the Australian colonies to dispatch ships from the Australian Squadron to China . The colonies also offered to assist further , but as most of their troops were still engaged in South Africa , they had to rely on naval forces for manpower . The force dispatched was a modest one , with Britain accepting 200 men from Victoria , 260 from New South Wales and the South Australian ship HMCS Protector , under the command of Captain William <unk> . Most of these forces were made up of naval brigade <unk> , who had been trained in both ship handling and <unk> to fulfil their coastal defence role . Amongst the naval contingent from New South Wales were 200 naval officers and sailors and 50 permanent soldiers headquartered at Victoria Barracks , Sydney who originally enlisted for the Second Boer War . The soldiers were keen to go to China but refused to be enlisted as sailors , while the New South Wales Naval Brigade objected to having soldiers in their ranks . The Army and Navy compromised and titled the contingent the <unk> Marine Light Infantry . 
 The Commonwealth of Australia came into existence on 1 January 1901 as a result of the federation of the Australian colonies . Under the Constitution of Australia , defence responsibility was now vested in the new federal government . The co @-@ ordination of Australia @-@ wide defensive efforts in the face of Imperial German interest in the Pacific Ocean was one of driving forces behind <unk> , and the Department of Defence immediately came into being as a result , while the Commonwealth Military Forces ( early forerunner of the Australian Army ) and Commonwealth Naval Force were also soon established . 
 The Australian Commonwealth Military Forces came into being on 1 March 1901 and all the colonial forces — including those still in South Africa — became part of the new force . 28 @,@ <unk> colonial soldiers , including 1 @,@ 457 professional soldiers , 18 @,@ 603 paid militia and 8 @,@ <unk> unpaid volunteers , were subsequently transferred . The individual units continued to be administered under the various colonial Acts until the Defence Act 1903 brought all the units under one piece of legislation . This Act also prevented the raising of standing infantry units and specified that militia forces could not be used in industrial disputes or serve outside Australia . However , the majority of soldiers remained in militia units , known as the Citizen Military Forces ( <unk> ) . Major General Sir Edward Hutton — a former commander of the New South Wales Military Forces — subsequently became the first commander of the Commonwealth Military Forces on 26 December and set to work <unk> an integrated structure for the new army . In 1911 , following a report by Lord <unk> the Royal Military College , <unk> was established , as was a system of universal National Service . 
 Prior to federation each self @-@ governing colony had operated its own naval force . These navies were small and lacked blue water capabilities , forcing the separate colonies to <unk> the cost of a British naval squadron in their waters for decades . The colonies maintained control over their respective navies until 1 March 1901 , when the Commonwealth Naval Force was created . This new force also lacked blue water capable ships , and ultimately did not lead to a change in Australian naval policy . In 1907 Prime Minister Alfred Deakin and <unk> , while attending the Imperial Conference in London , sought the British Government 's agreement to end the subsidy system and develop an Australian navy . The Admiralty rejected and resented the challenge , but suggested <unk> that a small fleet of destroyers and submarines would be sufficient . Deakin was unimpressed , and in 1908 invited the American Great White Fleet to visit Australia . This visit fired public enthusiasm for a modern navy and in part led to the order of two 700 @-@ ton River @-@ class destroyers . The surge in German naval construction prompted the Admiralty to change their position however and the Royal Australian Navy was subsequently formed in 1911 , absorbing the Commonwealth Naval Force . On 4 October 1913 , the new fleet steamed through Sydney Heads , consisting of the battlecruiser <unk> Australia , three light cruisers , and three destroyers , while several other ships were still under construction . And as a consequence the navy entered the First World War as a formidable force . 
 The Australian Flying Corps ( AFC ) was established as part of the Commonwealth Military Forces in 1912 , prior to the formation of the Australian Military Forces in 1916 and was later separated in 1921 to form the Royal Australian Air Force , making it the second oldest air force in the world . Regardless , the service branches were not linked by a single chain of command however , and each reported to their own minister and had separate administrative arrangements and government departments . 
 When Britain declared war on Germany at the start of the First World War , the Australian government rapidly followed suit , with Prime Minister Joseph Cook declaring on 5 August 1914 that " ... when the Empire is at war , so also is Australia " and reflecting the sentiment of many Australians that any declaration of war by Britain automatically included Australia . This was itself in part due to the large number of British @-@ born citizens and first generation Anglo @-@ Australians that made up the Australian population at the time . Indeed , by the end of the war almost 20 % of those who served in the Australian forces had been born in Britain . 
 As the existing militia forces were unable to serve overseas under the provisions of the Defence Act 1903 , an all @-@ volunteer expeditionary force known as the Australian Imperial Force ( AIF ) was formed and recruitment began on 10 August 1914 . The government pledged 20 @,@ 000 men , organised as one infantry division and one light horse brigade plus supporting units . <unk> and organisation was primarily regionally based and was undertaken under <unk> plans drawn up in 1912 . The first commander was Major General William Bridges , who also assumed command of the 1st Division . Throughout the course of the conflict Australian efforts were predominantly focused upon the ground war , although small air and naval forces were also committed . 
 Following the outbreak of war Australian forces moved quickly to reduce the threat to shipping posed by the proximity of Germany 's Pacific colonies . The Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force ( <unk> & <unk> ) , a 2000 @-@ man volunteer force — separate from the AIF — and consisting of an infantry battalion plus 500 naval <unk> and ex @-@ sailors , was rapidly formed under the command of William Holmes . The objectives of the force were the wireless stations on <unk> , and those at Yap in the Caroline Islands , and at Rabaul in German New Guinea . The force reached Rabaul on 11 September 1914 and occupied it the next day , encountering only brief resistance from the German and native defenders during fighting at <unk> <unk> and <unk> . German New Guinea surrendered on 17 September 1914 . Australian losses were light , including six killed during the fighting , but were compounded by the mysterious loss offshore of the submarine <unk> with all 35 men aboard . 
 The AIF departed by ship in a single convoy from Albany on 1 November 1914 . During the journey one of the convoy 's naval escorts — <unk> Sydney — engaged and destroyed the German cruiser SMS <unk> at the Battle of <unk> on 8 November , in the first ship @-@ to @-@ ship action involving the Royal Australian Navy . Although originally bound for England to undergo further training and then for employment on the Western Front , the Australians were instead sent to British @-@ controlled Egypt to pre @-@ <unk> any Turkish attack against the strategically important Suez Canal , and with a view to opening another front against the Central Powers . 
 <unk> to knock Turkey out of the war the British then decided to stage an amphibious <unk> at Gallipoli and following a period of training and reorganisation the Australians were included amongst the British , Indian and French forces committed to the campaign . The combined Australian and New Zealand Army Corps ( ANZAC ) — commanded by British general William Birdwood — subsequently landed at Anzac Cove on the Gallipoli peninsula on 25 April 1915 . Although promising to transform the war if successful , the Gallipoli Campaign was ill @-@ conceived and ultimately lasted eight months of bloody stalemate , without achieving its objectives . Australian casualties totalled 26 @,@ 111 , including 8 @,@ 141 killed . 
 For Australians and New Zealanders the Gallipoli campaign came to symbolise an important milestone in the emergence of both nations as independent actors on the world stage and the development of a sense of national identity . Today , the date of the initial landings , 25 April , is known as Anzac Day in Australia and New Zealand and every year thousands of people gather at memorials in both nations , as well as Turkey , to honour the bravery and sacrifice of the original <unk> , and of all those who have subsequently lost their lives in war . 
 After the withdrawal from Gallipoli the Australians returned to Egypt and the AIF underwent a major expansion . In 1916 the infantry began to move to France while the cavalry units remained in the Middle East to fight the Turks . Australian troops of the Anzac Mounted Division and the Australian Mounted Division saw action in all the major battles of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign , playing a pivotal role in fighting the Turkish troops that were threatening British control of Egypt . The Australian 's first saw combat during the <unk> uprising in the <unk> Desert and the Nile Valley , during which the combined British forces successfully put down the primitive pro @-@ Turkish Islamic sect with heavy casualties . The Anzac Mounted Division subsequently saw considerable action in the Battle of Romani against the Turkish between 3 – 5 August 1916 , with the Turks eventually pushed back . Following this victory the British forces went on the offensive in the Sinai , although the pace of the advance was governed by the speed by which the railway and water pipeline could be constructed from the Suez Canal . Rafa was captured on 9 January 1917 , while the last of the small Turkish garrisons in the Sinai were eliminated in February . 
 The advance entered Palestine and an initial , unsuccessful attempt was made to capture Gaza on 26 March 1917 , while a second and equally unsuccessful attempt was launched on 19 April . A third assault occurred between 31 October and 7 November and this time both the Anzac Mounted Division and the Australian Mounted Division took part . The battle was a complete success for the British , over @-@ running the Gaza @-@ Beersheba line and capturing 12 @,@ 000 Turkish soldiers . The critical moment was the capture of Beersheba on the first day , after the Australian 4th Light Horse Brigade charged more than 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) . The Turkish trenches were overrun , with the Australians capturing the wells at <unk> and securing the valuable water they contained along with over 700 prisoners for the loss of 31 killed and 36 wounded . Later , Australian troops assisted in pushing the Turkish forces out of Palestine and took part in actions at <unk> Ridge , Jerusalem and the <unk> . The Turkish government surrendered on 30 October 1918 . Units of the Light Horse were subsequently used to help put down a nationalist revolt in Egypt in 1919 and did so with efficiency and brutality , although they suffered a number of fatalities in the process . 
 Meanwhile , the AFC had undergone remarkable development , and its independence as a separate national force was unique among the <unk> . <unk> just a single aircraft to German New Guinea in 1914 , the first operational flight did not occur until 27 May 1915 however , when the <unk> Half Flight was called upon to assist in protecting British oil interests in Iraq . The AFC was soon expanded and four squadrons later saw action in Egypt , Palestine and on the Western Front , where they performed well . 
 Five infantry divisions of the AIF saw action in France and Belgium , leaving Egypt in March 1916 . I Anzac Corps subsequently took up positions in a quiet sector south of <unk> on 7 April 1916 and for the next two and a half years the AIF participated in most of the major battles on the Western Front , earning a formidable reputation . Although spared from the disastrous first day of the Battle of the Somme , within weeks four Australian divisions had been committed . The 5th Division , positioned on the left flank , was the first in action during the Battle of <unk> on 19 July 1916 , suffering 5 @,@ 533 casualties in a single day . The 1st Division entered the line on 23 July , assaulting <unk> , and by the time that they were relieved by the 2nd Division on 27 July , they had suffered 5 @,@ 286 casualties . Mouquet Farm was attacked in August , with casualties totalling 6 @,@ 300 men . By the time the AIF was withdrawn from the Somme to re @-@ organise , they had suffered 23 @,@ 000 casualties in just 45 days . 
 In March 1917 , the 2nd and 5th Divisions pursued the Germans back to the Hindenburg Line , capturing the town of <unk> . On 11 April , the 4th Division assaulted the Hindenburg Line in the disastrous First Battle of <unk> , losing over 3 @,@ 000 casualties and 1 @,@ 170 captured . On 15 April , the 1st and 2nd Divisions were counter @-@ attacked near <unk> and were forced to abandon the town , before <unk> it again . The 2nd Division then took part in the Second Battle of <unk> , beginning on 3 May , and succeeded in taking sections of the Hindenburg Line and holding them until relieved by the 1st Division . Finally , on 7 May the 5th Division relieved the 1st , remaining in the line until the battle ended in mid @-@ May . Combined these efforts cost 7 @,@ <unk> Australian casualties . 
 On 7 June 1917 , the II Anzac Corps — along with two British corps — launched an operation in Flanders to eliminate a salient south of Ypres . The attack commenced with the detonation of a million pounds ( 454 @,@ 545 kg ) of explosives that had been placed underneath the <unk> ridge , destroying the German trenches . The advance was virtually unopposed , and despite strong German counterattacks the next day , it succeeded . Australian casualties during the Battle of <unk> included nearly 6 @,@ 800 men . I Anzac Corps then took part in the Third Battle of Ypres in Belgium as part of the campaign to capture the <unk> Plateau , between September and November 1917 . Individual actions took place at <unk> Road , <unk> Wood , <unk> , <unk> and Passchendaele and over the course of eight weeks fighting the Australians suffered 38 @,@ 000 casualties . 
 On 21 March 1918 the German Army launched its Spring Offensive in a last @-@ <unk> effort to win the war , <unk> sixty @-@ three divisions over a 70 miles ( 110 km ) front . As the Allies fell back the 3rd and 4th Divisions were rushed south to Amiens on the Somme . The offensive lasted for the next five months and all five AIF divisions in France were engaged in the attempt to stem the tide . By late May the Germans had pushed to within 50 miles ( 80 km ) of Paris . During this time the Australians fought at <unk> , <unk> , <unk> @-@ <unk> , <unk> Wood , <unk> , and Hamel . At Hamel the commander of the Australian Corps , Lieutenant General John Monash , successfully used combined arms — including aircraft , artillery and armour — in an attack for the first time . 
 The German offensive ground to a halt in mid @-@ July and a brief lull followed , during which the Australians undertook a series of raids , known as <unk> <unk> . The Allies soon launched their own offensive — the Hundred Days Offensive — ultimately ending the war . Beginning on 8 August 1918 the offensive included four Australian divisions striking at Amiens . Using the combined arms techniques developed earlier at Hamel , significant gains were made on what became known as the " Black Day " of the German Army . The offensive continued for four months , and during Second Battle of the Somme the Australian Corps fought actions at <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and Mont St Quentin , before their final engagement of the war on 5 October 1918 at <unk> . The AIF was subsequently out of the line when the armistice was declared on 11 November 1918 . 
 In all <unk> @,@ <unk> Australians enlisted in the AIF during the war and 333 @,@ 000 served overseas . 61 @,@ 508 were killed and another 155 @,@ 000 were wounded ( a total casualty rate of 65 % ) . The financial cost to the Australian government was calculated at £ <unk> @,@ <unk> @,@ <unk> . Two <unk> on conscription for overseas service had been defeated during the war , preserving the volunteer status of the Australian force , but stretching the reserves of manpower available , particularly towards the end of the fighting . Consequently , Australia remained one of only two armies on either side not to resort to conscription during the war . 
 The war had a profound effect on Australian society in other ways also . Indeed , for many Australians the nation 's involvement is seen as a symbol of its emergence as an international actor , while many of the notions of Australian character and <unk> that exist today have their origins in the war . 64 Australians were awarded the Victoria Cross during the First World War . 
 The Russian Civil War began after the Russian provisional government collapsed and the <unk> party assumed power in October 1917 . Following the end of the First World War , the western powers — including Britain — intervened , giving half @-@ hearted support to the pro @-@ <unk> , anti @-@ <unk> White Russian forces . Although the Australian government refused to commit forces , many Australians serving with the British Army became involved in the fighting . A small number served as advisors to White Russian units with the North Russian Expeditionary Force ( <unk> ) . <unk> repatriation in England , about 150 Australians subsequently enlisted in the British North Russia Relief Force ( <unk> ) , where they were involved in a number of sharp battles and several were killed . 
 The Royal Australian Navy destroyer <unk> Swan was also briefly engaged , carrying out an intelligence gathering mission in the Black Sea in late 1918 . Other Australians served as advisers with the British Military Mission to the White Russian General , Anton <unk> in South Russia , while several more advised Admiral <unk> <unk> in Siberia . Later , they also served in Mesopotamia as part of <unk> and the <unk> Mission , although these missions were aimed at preventing Turkish access to the Middle East and India , and did little fighting . 
 Although the motivations of those Australian 's that volunteered to fight in Russia can only be guessed at , it seems unlikely to have been political . Regardless , they confirmed a reputation for <unk> and courage , winning the only two Victoria Crosses of the land campaign , despite their small numbers . Yet Australian involvement was barely noticed at home at the time and made little difference to the outcome of the war . Total casualties included 10 killed and 40 wounded , with most deaths being from disease during operations in Mesopotamia . 
 In October 1927 , <unk> Adelaide was called to the British Solomon Islands <unk> as part of a punitive expedition in response to the killing of a district officer and sixteen others by <unk> natives at <unk> on the island of <unk> on 3 October , known as the <unk> massacre . Arriving at <unk> on 14 October , the ship proceeded to <unk> to protect the landing of three platoons of troops , then remained in the area to provide personnel support for the soldiers as they searched for the <unk> . The ship 's personnel took no part in operations ashore , providing only logistic and communications support . Adelaide returned to Australia on 23 November . 
 A small number of Australian volunteers fought on both sides of the Spanish Civil War , although they predominantly supported the Spanish Republic through the International Brigades . The Australians were subsequently allocated to the battalions of other <unk> , such as the British Battalion and the Lincoln Battalion , rather than forming their own units . Most were radicals motivated by ideological reasons , while a number were Spanish @-@ born migrants who returned to fight in their country of origin . At least 66 Australians volunteered , with only one — <unk> Bull , a conservative <unk> who was later killed serving in the RAF during the Second World War — known to have fought for General Francisco Franco 's Nationalist forces . 
 While a celebrated cause for the Australian left — particularly the Communist Party of Australia and the trade union movement — the war failed to spark particular public interest and the government maintained its neutrality . Australian opposition to the Republican cause was <unk> by <unk> <unk> on an anti @-@ communist basis , rather than a pro @-@ Nationalist basis . <unk> , although individual right wing Australians may have served with the Nationalist rebels , they received no public support . Service in a foreign armed force was illegal at the time , however as the government received no reports of Australians travelling to Spain to enlist , no action was taken . Consequently , returned veterans were neither recognised by the government or the <unk> and Services League of Australia ( <unk> ) . Although the number of Australian volunteers was relatively small compared to those from other countries , at least 14 were killed . 
 Australia entered the Second World War on 3 September 1939 . At the time of the declaration of war against Germany the Australian military was small and <unk> for war . <unk> for a Second Australian Imperial Force ( 2nd AIF ) began in mid @-@ September . While there was no rush of volunteers like the First World War , a high proportion of Australian men of military age had enlisted by mid @-@ 1940 . Four infantry divisions were formed during 1939 and 1940 , three of which were dispatched to the Middle East . The RAAF 's resources were initially mainly devoted to training airmen for service with the Commonwealth air forces through the Empire Air Training Scheme ( <unk> ) , through which almost 28 @,@ 000 Australians were trained during the war . 
 The Australian military 's first major engagements of the war were against Italian forces in the Mediterranean and North Africa . During 1940 the light cruiser <unk> Sydney and five elderly destroyers ( dubbed the " <unk> Iron Flotilla " by Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels — a title proudly accepted by the ships ) took part in a series of operations as part of the British Mediterranean Fleet , and sank several Italian warships . The Army first saw action in January 1941 , when the 6th Division formed part of the Commonwealth forces during Operation <unk> . The division assaulted and captured <unk> on 5 January and <unk> on 22 January , with tens of thousands of Italian troops surrendering at both towns . The 6th Division took part in the pursuit of the Italian Army and captured <unk> on 4 February . In late February it was withdrawn for service in Greece , and was replaced by the 9th Division . 
 The Australian forces in the Mediterranean endured a number of campaigns during 1941 . During April , the 6th Division , other elements of I Corps and several Australian warships formed part of the Allied force which unsuccessfully attempted to defend Greece from German invasion during the Battle of Greece . At the end of this campaign , the 6th Division was evacuated to Egypt and Crete . The force at Crete subsequently fought in the Battle of Crete during May , which also ended in defeat for the Allies . Over 5 @,@ 000 Australians were captured in these campaigns , and the 6th Division required a long period of rebuilding before it was again ready for combat . The Germans and Italians also went on the offensive in North Africa at the end of March and drove the Commonwealth force there back to near the border with Egypt . The 9th Division and a brigade of the 7th Division were besieged at <unk> ; successfully defending the key port town until they were replaced by British units in October . During June , the main body of the 7th Division , a brigade of the 6th Division and the I Corps headquarters took part in the Syria @-@ Lebanon Campaign against the <unk> French . Resistance was stronger than expected ; Australians were involved in most of the fighting and sustained most of the casualties before the French <unk> in early July . 
 The majority of Australian units in the Mediterranean returned to Australia in early 1942 , after the outbreak of the Pacific War . The 9th Division was the largest unit to remain in the Middle East , and played a key role in the First Battle of El <unk> during June and the Second Battle of El <unk> in October . The division returned to Australia in early 1943 , but several RAAF squadrons and <unk> warships took part in the subsequent Tunisia Campaign and the Italian Campaign from 1943 until the end of the war . 
 The RAAF 's role in the strategic air offensive in Europe formed Australia 's main contribution to the defeat of Germany . Approximately 13 @,@ 000 Australian airmen served in dozens of British and five Australian squadrons in RAF <unk> Command between 1940 and the end of the war . Australians took part in all of <unk> Command 's major offensives and suffered heavy losses during raids on German cities and targets in France . Australian aircrew in <unk> Command had one of the highest casualty rates of any part of the Australian military during the Second World War and sustained almost 20 percent of all Australian deaths in combat ; 3 @,@ 486 were killed and hundreds more were taken prisoner . Australian airmen in light bomber and fighter squadrons also participated in the liberation of Western Europe during 1944 and 1945 and two RAAF maritime patrol squadrons served in the Battle of the Atlantic . 
 From the 1920s Australia 's defence thinking was dominated by British Imperial defence policy , which was embodied by the " Singapore strategy " . This strategy involved the construction and defence of a major naval base at Singapore from which a large British fleet would respond to Japanese aggression in the region . To this end , a high proportion of Australian forces in Asia were concentrated in Malaya during 1940 and 1941 as the threat from Japan increased . However , as a result of the emphasis on co @-@ operation with Britain , relatively few Australian military units had been retained in Australia and the Asia @-@ Pacific region . Measures were taken to improve Australia 's defences as war with Japan <unk> in 1941 , but these proved inadequate . In December 1941 , the Australian Army in the Pacific comprised the 8th Division , most of which was stationed in Malaya , and eight partially trained and equipped divisions in Australia . The RAAF was equipped with 373 aircraft , most of which were obsolete trainers , and the <unk> had three cruisers and two destroyers in Australian waters . 
 The Australian military suffered a series of defeats during the early months of the Pacific War . The 8th Division and RAAF squadrons in Malaya formed a part of the British Commonwealth forces which were unable to stop a smaller Japanese invasion force which landed on 7 December . The British Commonwealth force withdrew to Singapore at the end of January , but was forced to surrender on 15 February after the Japanese captured much of the island . Smaller Australian forces were also overwhelmed and defeated during early 1942 at Rabaul , and in Ambon , Timor , and Java . The Australian town of Darwin was heavily bombed by the Japanese on 19 February , to prevent it from being used as an Allied base . Over 22 @,@ 000 Australians were taken prisoner in early 1942 and endured harsh conditions in Japanese captivity . The prisoners were subjected to <unk> , denied medical treatment and frequently beaten and killed by their guards . As a result , 8 @,@ 296 Australian prisoners died in captivity . 
 The rapid Allied defeat in the Pacific caused many Australians to fear that the Japanese would invade the Australian mainland . While elements of the Imperial Japanese Navy proposed this in early 1942 , it was judged to be impossible by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters , which instead adopted a strategy of isolating Australia from the United States by capturing New Guinea , the Solomon Islands , Fiji , Samoa , and New Caledonia . This fact was not known by the Allies at the time , and the Australian military was greatly expanded to meet the threat of invasion . Large numbers of United States Army and Army Air Forces units arrived in Australia in early 1942 , and the Australian military was placed under the overall command of General Douglas MacArthur in March . 
 Australians played a central role in the New Guinea campaign during 1942 and 1943 . After an attempt to land troops at Port Moresby was defeated in the Battle of the Coral Sea , the Japanese attempted to capture the strategically important town by advancing overland across the Owen Stanley Ranges and Milne Bay . Australian Army units defeated these offensives in the <unk> Track campaign and Battle of Milne Bay with the support of the RAAF and USAAF . Australian and US Army units subsequently assaulted and captured the Japanese bases on the north coast of Papua in the hard @-@ fought Battle of <unk> @-@ <unk> . The Australian Army also defeated a Japanese attempt to capture the town of <unk> in January 1943 and went onto the offensive in the <unk> @-@ Lae campaign in April . In late 1943 , the 7th and 9th Divisions played an important role in Operation <unk> , when they landed to the east and west of Lae and secured the <unk> Peninsula during the <unk> Peninsula campaign and <unk> Range campaign . 
 The Australian mainland came under attack during 1942 and 1943 . Japanese submarines operated off Australia from May to August 1942 and January to June 1943 . These attacks sought to cut the Allied supply lines between Australia and the US and Australia and New Guinea , but were unsuccessful . Japanese aircraft also conducted air raids against Allied bases in northern Australia which were being used to mount the North Western Area Campaign against Japanese positions in the Netherlands East Indies ( <unk> ) . 
 Australia 's role in the Pacific War declined from 1944 . The increasing size of the US forces in the Pacific rendered the Australian military superfluous and labour shortages forced the Government to reduce the size of the armed forces to boost war production . Nevertheless , the Government wanted the Australian military to remain active , and agreed to MacArthur 's proposals that it be used in relatively unimportant campaigns . In late 1944 , Australian troops and RAAF squadrons replaced US garrisons in eastern New Guinea , New Britain , and <unk> , and launched offensives aimed at destroying or containing the remaining Japanese forces there . In May 1945 , I Corps , the Australian First Tactical Air Force and USAAF and USN units began the Borneo Campaign , which continued until the end of the war . These campaigns contributed little to Japan 's defeat and remain controversial . 
 Following Japan 's surrender on 15 August 1945 Australia assumed responsibility for occupying much of Borneo and the eastern Netherlands East Indies until British and Dutch colonial rule was restored . Australian authorities also conducted a number of war crimes trials of Japanese personnel . <unk> @,@ 000 Australians enlisted during the war , while <unk> @,@ 000 served overseas . Casualties included 39 @,@ 767 killed and another 66 @,@ <unk> were wounded . 20 Victoria Crosses were awarded to Australians . 
 The <unk> of the Australian military following the end of the Second World War was completed in 1947 . Plans for post @-@ war defence arrangements were <unk> on maintaining a relatively strong peacetime force . It was envisioned that the Royal Australian Navy maintaining a fleet that would include two light fleet carriers , two cruisers , six destroyers , 16 others ships in commission and another 52 in reserved . The Royal Australian Air Force would have a strength of 16 squadrons , including four manned by the Citizen Air Force . Meanwhile , in a significant departure from previous Australian defence policy which had previously relied on citizen forces , the Australian Army would include a permanent field force of 19 @,@ 000 regulars organised into a brigade of three infantry battalions with armoured support , serving alongside a part @-@ time force of 50 @,@ 000 men in the Citizen Military Forces . The Australian Regular Army was subsequently formed on 30 September 1947 , while the <unk> was re @-@ raised on 1 July 1948 . 
 During the early years of the Cold War , Australian defence planning assumed that in the event of the outbreak of a global war between the Western world and Eastern bloc countries it would need to contribute forces under collective security arrangements as part of the United Nations , or a coalition led by either the United States or Britain . The Middle East was considered the most likely area of operations for Australian forces , where they would most likely operate with British forces . Early commitments included the involvement of RAAF aircrew during the Berlin <unk> in 1948 – 49 and the deployment of No. 78 Wing RAAF to Malta in the Mediterranean from 1952 to 1954 . Meanwhile , defence preparedness initiatives included the introduction of a National Service Scheme in 1951 to provide manpower for the citizen forces of the Army , RAAF and <unk> . 
 On 25 June 1950 , the North Korean Army ( KPA ) crossed the border into South Korea and advanced for the capital Seoul , which fell in less than a week . North Korean forces continued toward the port of Pusan and two days later the United States offered its assistance to South Korea . In response the United Nations Security Council requested members to assist in <unk> the North Korean attack . Australia initially contributed P @-@ 51 Mustang fighter @-@ bomber aircraft from No. 77 Squadron RAAF and infantry from the 3rd Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment ( 3 RAR ) , both of which were stationed in Japan as part of the <unk> . In addition , it provided the majority of supply and support personnel to the British Commonwealth Forces Korea . The <unk> frigate <unk> <unk> , and the destroyer <unk> <unk> , were also committed . Later , an aircraft carrier strike group aboard <unk> Sydney was added to the force . 
 By the time 3 RAR arrived in Pusan on 28 September , the North Koreans were in retreat following the <unk> landings . As a part of the invasion force under the UN Supreme Commander , General Douglas MacArthur , the battalion moved north and was involved in its first major action at Battle of <unk> near <unk> on 22 October , before advancing towards the <unk> River . Further successful actions followed at <unk> on 25 – 26 October 1950 and at <unk> on 29 October 1950 . North Korean casualties were heavy , while Australian losses included their commanding officer , Lieutenant Colonel Charles Green , who was wounded in the stomach by artillery fire after the battle and succumbed to his wounds and died two days later on 1 November . Meanwhile , during the last weeks of October the Chinese had moved 18 divisions of the People 's Volunteer Army across the <unk> River to reinforce the remnants of the KPA . <unk> by US and South Korean intelligence , the 13th Army Group crossed the border on 16 October and penetrated up to 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) into North Korea , and were reinforced in early November by 12 divisions from the 9th Army Group ; in total 30 divisions composed of 380 @,@ 000 men . 3 RAR fought its first action against the Chinese at <unk> on 5 November . The fighting cost the battalion heavily and despite halting a Chinese division the new battalion commander was dismissed in the wake . Following the Chinese intervention , the UN forces were defeated in successive battles and 3 RAR was forced to withdraw to the 38th parallel . 
 A series of battles followed at <unk> on 1 – 4 January 1951 , as the British and Australians occupied defensive positions in an attempt to secure the northern approaches to the South Korean capital . Further fighting occurred at <unk> @-@ <unk> on 14 – 17 February 1951 following another Chinese advance , and later at <unk> @-@ San between 7 – 12 March 1951 as the UN resumed the offensive . Australian troops subsequently participated in two more major battles in 1951 , with the first taking place during fighting which later became known as the Battle of <unk> . On 22 April , Chinese forces attacked the <unk> valley and forced the South Korean defenders to withdraw . Australian and Canadian troops were ordered to halt this Chinese advance . After a night of fighting the Australians recaptured their positions , at the cost of 32 men killed and 59 wounded . In July 1951 , the Australian battalion became part of the combined Canadian , British , Australian , New Zealand , and Indian 1st Commonwealth Division . The second major battle took place during Operation Commando and occurred after the Chinese attacked a salient in a bend of the Imjin River . The 1st Commonwealth Division counter @-@ attacked on 3 October , capturing a number of objectives including Hill 355 and Hill 317 during the Battle of Maryang San ; after five days the Chinese retreated . Australian casualties included 20 dead and 104 wounded . 
 The <unk> then became locked in static trench warfare akin to the First World War , in which men lived in tunnels , redoubts , and <unk> forts behind barbed wire defences . From 1951 until the end of the war , 3 RAR held trenches on the eastern side of the division 's positions in the hills northeast of the Imjin River . Across from them were heavily fortified Chinese positions . In March 1952 , Australia increased its ground commitment to two battalions , sending 1 RAR . This battalion remained in Korea for 12 months , before being replaced by 2 RAR in April 1953 . The Australians fought their last battle during 24 – 26 July 1953 , with 2 RAR holding off a <unk> Chinese attack along the <unk> River and inflicting significant casualties for the loss of five killed and 24 wounded . <unk> were suspended on 27 July 1953 . 17 @,@ 808 Australians served during the war , with 341 killed , 1 @,@ 216 wounded and 30 captured . 
 The Malayan Emergency was declared on 18 June 1948 , after three estate managers were murdered by members of the Malayan Communist Party ( <unk> ) . Australian involvement began in June 1950 , when in response to a British request , six <unk> from No. 1 Squadron and a flight of Dakotas from No. 38 Squadron arrived in Singapore to form part of the British Commonwealth Far East Air Force ( <unk> ) . The Dakotas were subsequently used on cargo runs , troop movement , as well as <unk> and <unk> drops , while the Lincoln bombers carried out bombing raids against the Communist Terrorist ( CT ) jungle bases . The RAAF were particularly successful , and in one such mission known as Operation <unk> , five Lincoln bombers destroyed 181 communist camps , killed 13 communists and forced one into surrender , in a joint operation with the RAF and ground troops . The <unk> were withdrawn in 1958 , and were replaced by Canberra bombers from No. 2 Squadron and CAC Sabres from No. 78 Wing . Based at RAAF Base <unk> they also carried out a number ground attack missions against the guerrillas . 
 Australian ground forces were deployed to Malaya in October 1955 as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve . In January 1956 , the first Australian ground forces were deployed on Malaysian peninsula , consisting of the 2nd Battalion , Royal Australian Regiment ( 2 RAR ) . 2 RAR mainly participated in " <unk> up " operations over the next 20 months , conducting extensive patrolling in and near the CT jungle bases , as part of 28th British Commonwealth Brigade . Contact with the enemy was <unk> and results small , achieving relatively few kills . 2 RAR left Malaysia October 1957 to be replaced by 3 RAR . 3 RAR underwent six weeks of jungle training and began driving <unk> insurgents back into the jungle of <unk> and <unk> . The new battalion extensively patrolled and was involved in food denial operations and ambushes . Again contact was limited , although 3 RAR had more success than its predecessor . By late 1959 , operations against the <unk> were in their final phase , and most communists had been pushed back and across the Thailand border . 3 RAR left Malaysia October 1959 and was replaced by 1 RAR . Though patrolling the border 1 RAR did not make contact with the insurgents , and in October 1960 it was replaced by 2 RAR , which stayed in Malaysia until August 1963 . The Malayan Emergency officially ended on 31 July 1960 . 
 Australia also provided artillery and engineer support , along with an air @-@ field construction squadron . The Royal Australian Navy also served in Malayan waters , firing on suspected communist positions between 1956 and 1957 . The Emergency was the longest continued commitment in Australian military history ; 7 @,@ 000 Australians served and 51 died in Malaya — although only 15 were on operations — and another 27 were wounded . 
 At the start of the 1960s , Prime Minister Robert <unk> greatly expanded the Australian military so that it could carry out the Government 's policy of " Forward Defence " in South East Asia . In 1964 , <unk> announced a large increase in defence spending . The strength of the Australian Army would be increased by 50 % over three years from 22 @,@ 000 to 33 @,@ 000 ; providing a full three @-@ brigade division with nine battalions . The RAAF and <unk> would also both be increased by 25 % . In 1964 , conscription or National Service was re @-@ introduced under the National Service Act , for selected 20 @-@ year @-@ olds based on date of birth , for a period of two years ' continuous full @-@ time service ( the previous scheme having been suspended in 1959 ) . 
 In 1961 , three Charles F. Adams @-@ class destroyers were purchased from the United States to replace the ageing Q @-@ class destroyers . Traditionally , the <unk> had purchased designs based on those of the Royal Navy and the purchase of American destroyers was significant . <unk> Perth and <unk> Hobart joined the fleet in 1965 , followed by <unk> Brisbane in 1967 . Other projects included the construction of six River @-@ class frigates , the conversion of the aircraft carrier <unk> Melbourne to an anti @-@ submarine role , the acquisition of ten Wessex helicopters , and the purchase of six Oberon @-@ class submarines . 
 The RAAF took delivery of their first <unk> fighters in 1967 , <unk> No. 3 , No. 75 and No. 77 Squadrons with them . The service also received American F @-@ 111 strike aircraft , C @-@ 130 <unk> transports , P @-@ 3 Orion maritime reconnaissance aircraft and Italian <unk> trainers . 
 The Indonesia @-@ Malaysia confrontation was fought from 1962 to 1966 between the British Commonwealth and Indonesia over the creation of the Federation of Malaysia , with the Commonwealth attempting to safeguard the security of the new state . The war remained limited , and was fought primarily on the island of Borneo , although a number of Indonesian <unk> and airborne incursions onto the Malay Peninsula did occur . As part of Australia 's continuing military commitment to the security of Malaysia , army , naval and <unk> units were based there as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve . Regardless the Australian government was wary of involvement in a war with Indonesia and initially limited its involvement to the defence of the Malayan peninsula only . On two occasions Australian troops from 3 RAR were used to help <unk> up <unk> from <unk> and airborne incursions at <unk> and <unk> , in September and October 1964 . 
 Following these raids the government conceded to British and Malaysian requests to deploy an infantry battalion to Borneo . During the early phases , British and Malaysian troops had attempted only to control the Malaysian / Indonesian border , and to protect population centres . However , by the time the Australian battalion deployed the British had decided on more aggressive action , crossing the border into <unk> to obtain information and conduct ambushes to force the <unk> to remain on the defensive , under the <unk> Operation <unk> . The fighting took place in mountainous , jungle @-@ clad terrain , and a debilitating climate , with operations characterised by the extensive use of company bases sited along the border , cross @-@ border operations , the use of helicopters for troop movement and resupply , and the role of human and signals intelligence to determine enemy movements and intentions . 
 Operations in Borneo were extremely sensitive and they received little press coverage in Australia , while official acknowledgement of involvement in cross @-@ border missions only occurred in 1996 . Following a military coup in Indonesia in early 1966 which brought General <unk> to power , a peace treaty was signed in August 1966 which ended the conflict . 3 @,@ 500 Australians served during <unk> ; casualties included 16 dead , with seven killed in action and eight wounded . 
 Australia 's involvement in the Vietnam War was driven largely by the rise of communism in Southeast Asia after the Second World War , and the fear of its spread which developed in Australia during the 1950s and early 1960s . As a consequence , Australia supported South Vietnam throughout the early 1960s . In 1961 and 1962 , the leader of the South Vietnamese government , <unk> <unk> <unk> , asked for assistance from the US and its allies in response to a growing insurgency supported by communist North Vietnam . Australia offered 30 military advisors from the Australian Army Training Team Vietnam , which became known simply as " The Team " . They arrived in July and August 1962 , beginning Australia 's involvement in the war . Later in August 1964 , the RAAF sent a flight of <unk> transport aircraft to the port city of <unk> <unk> . 
 The Australian withdrawal effectively commenced in November 1970 . As a consequence of the overall allied strategy of Vietnamization and with the Australian government keen to reduce its own commitment to the war , 8 RAR was not replaced at the end of its tour of duty . 1 <unk> was again reduced to just two infantry battalions , albeit with significant armour , artillery and aviation support remaining . Australian combat forces were further reduced during 1971 as part of a phased withdrawal , and 1 <unk> ceased operations in October . Meanwhile , the advisors remained to train South Vietnamese troops until withdrawn on 18 December 1972 by the newly elected Labor government of <unk> <unk> . The last Australian forces were finally withdrawn in 1973 . The Vietnam War was Australia 's longest and most controversial war and although initially enjoying broad support , as the nation 's military involvement increased a vocal anti @-@ war movement developed . More than 50 @,@ 000 Australians served in Vietnam ; <unk> were killed and 2 @,@ 398 were wounded . Four were awarded the Victoria Cross . 
 Although the importance of ' joint ' warfare had been highlighted during Second World War when Australian naval , ground and air units frequently served as part of single commands , the absence of a central authority continued to result in poor co @-@ ordination between the services in the post @-@ war era , with each organising and operating on the basis of a different military doctrine . The need for an integrated command structure received more emphasis during the Australian military 's experiences in the Vietnam War . In 1973 , the Secretary of the Department of Defence , Arthur <unk> , submitted a report to the Government that recommended the unification of the separate departments supporting each service into a single department and the creation of the post of Chief of the Defence Force Staff . 
 The <unk> Labor Government subsequently amalgamated the five defence <unk> ( Defence , Navy , Army , Air Force , and Supply ) into a single Department of Defence in 1973 , while conscription under the National Service scheme was abolished . On 1 January 1976 , the three branches of the Australian military were brought together as a unified , all @-@ volunteer , professional force known as the Australian Defence Force ( <unk> ) . Today , the <unk> is headquartered at Russell <unk> in Canberra and is divided into Air , Land , Maritime and Special Operations <unk> . In addition , Northern Command is based in Darwin , and is responsible for operations in Northern Australia . 
 Until the 1970s , Australia 's military strategy centred on the concept of Forward Defence , in which the role of Australian military and naval forces were to co @-@ operate with Allied forces to counter threats in Australia 's region . Following the adoption of the Guam Doctrine by the United States in 1969 , and the British withdrawal ' east of Suez ' in the early 1970s , Australia developed a defence policy emphasising self @-@ reliance and the defence of the Australian continent . Known as the Defence of Australia Policy , it focused Australian defence planning on protecting the nation 's northern maritime approaches ( the ' air @-@ sea gap ' ) against possible attack . 
 In line with this goal , the <unk> was <unk> to increase its ability to strike at enemy forces from Australian bases and to counter raids on continental Australia . This was achieved by increasing the capabilities of the <unk> and RAAF , and relocating regular Army units to Northern Australia . During this time the <unk> had no military units on operational deployment outside Australia . However , in 1987 the <unk> made its first operational deployment as part of Operation Morris Dance , in which several warships and a rifle company deployed to the waters off Fiji in response to the 1987 <unk> coups d 'état . While broadly successful , this deployment highlighted the need for the <unk> to improve its capability to rapidly respond to <unk> events . 
 During this period Australia continued to retain forces in Malaysia as part of the Five Power Defence <unk> ( <unk> ) agreed in 1971 to defend it in the event of external attack , with this commitment initially including significant air , ground and naval forces . However , these forces were gradually reduced with the infantry battalion withdrawn from Singapore in 1973 , and the two <unk> fighter squadrons in 1988 . Since then a detachment of Orion maritime patrol aircraft , support personnel , and an infantry company known as Rifle Company <unk> have been maintained , as well as occasional deployments of F / A @-@ 18 <unk> fighter aircraft . Australian submarines were reportedly also involved in a number of clandestine surveillance missions throughout Asian waters in the last decades of the Cold War . <unk> and Navy units were also involved in tracking Soviet ship and submarine movements in the region . Since then the <unk> have continued to participate in maritime security operations as part of Operation Gateway , conducting patrols over the Indian Ocean , Strait of <unk> and South China Sea . They have reportedly also been involved in freedom of navigation flights . 
 Australia was a member of the international coalition which contributed military forces to the 1991 Gulf War , deploying a naval task group of two warships , a support ship and a clearance diving team ; in total about 750 personnel . The Australian contribution was the first time Australian personnel were deployed to an active war zone since the establishment of the <unk> and the deployment tested its capabilities and command structure . However , the Australian force did not see combat , and instead playing a significant role in enforcing the sanctions put in place against Iraq following the invasion of Kuwait . Some <unk> personnel serving on exchange with British and American units did see combat , and a few were later decorated for their actions . Following the war , the Navy regularly deployed a frigate to the Persian Gulf or Red Sea to enforce the trade sanctions which continued to be applied to Iraq . A number of Australian airmen and ground crew posted to or on exchange with US and British air forces subsequently participated in enforcing no @-@ fly zones imposed over Iraq between 1991 and 2003 . 
 Since the late 1980s , the Australian government had increasingly called upon the <unk> to contribute forces to peacekeeping missions around the world . While most of these deployments involved only small numbers of specialists , several led to the deployment of hundreds of personnel . Large peacekeeping deployments were made to <unk> in early 1989 , Cambodia between 1992 and 1993 , Somalia in 1993 , <unk> between 1994 and 1995 and <unk> in 1994 and from 1997 onwards . The 1996 election of the Howard Liberal government resulted in significant reforms to the <unk> 's force structure and role , with the new government 's defence strategy placed less singular emphasis on defending Australia from direct attack and greater emphasis on working in co @-@ operation with regional states and Australia 's allies to manage potential security threats in recognition of Australia 's global security interests . In line with this new focus , the <unk> 's force structure changed in an attempt to increase the proportion of combat units to support units and to improve the <unk> 's combat effectiveness . 
 The former @-@ Portuguese colony of East Timor was invaded by Indonesia in 1975 , however , following years of violent struggle the new Indonesian government of President <unk> <unk> subsequently agreed to allow the East <unk> to vote on autonomy in 1999 . The United Nations Mission in East Timor ( <unk> ) was established to organise and conduct the vote , which was held at the end of August 1999 and resulted with 78 @.@ 5 % of voters deciding in favour of independence . However , following the announcement of the results pro @-@ Indonesian militias supported by elements of the Indonesian military , launched a campaign of violence , looting and <unk> and many East <unk> were killed , while perhaps more than 500 @,@ 000 were displaced . Unable to control the violence , Indonesia subsequently agreed to the deployment of a multinational peacekeeping force . Australia , which had contributed police to <unk> , organised and led an international military coalition , known as the International Force for East Timor ( <unk> ) , a non @-@ UN force operating in accordance with UN resolutions . The total size of the Australian force committed numbered 5 @,@ 500 personnel , and included a significant ground force , supported by air and naval forces , in the largest single deployment of Australian forces since 1945 . 
 The unexpected deployment to East Timor in 1999 led to significant changes in Australian defence policy and to an enhancement of the <unk> 's ability to conduct operations outside Australia . This successful deployment was the first time a large Australian military force had operated outside of Australia since the Vietnam War and revealed shortcomings in the <unk> 's ability to mount and sustain such operations . In response , the 2000 Defence White Paper placed a greater emphasis on preparing the <unk> for overseas deployments . The Australian government committed to improve the <unk> 's capabilities by improving the readiness and equipment of <unk> units , expanding the <unk> to 57 @,@ 000 full @-@ time personnel and increasing real Defence expenditure by 3 % per year . 
 In May 2006 , 2 @,@ 000 <unk> personnel were again deployed to East Timor as part of Operation <unk> , following unrest between elements of the Timor <unk> Defence Force . Australian forces were involved in a number <unk> during this time , including a heavy clash with rebels commanded by <unk> <unk> at Same on 4 March 2007 . However , by early @-@ 2010 the security situation had been <unk> and just 400 Australian personnel remained to train the local security forces as part of a small international force . Following a <unk> , the International <unk> Force commenced withdrawing from Timor @-@ <unk> in November 2012 , a process which was completed in April 2013 . 
 Australian forces were at times involved in heavy fighting , and significant actions included Operation <unk> in 2002 and Operation Perth in 2006 , as well as actions in <unk> in 2007 , <unk> in 2009 , the Shah <unk> <unk> and <unk> in 2010 , and <unk> in 2011 ; although others have yet to be publicly acknowledged due to operational security requirements . Casualties include 41 killed and 256 wounded , while another Australian also died serving with the British Army . Four Australians have been awarded the Victoria Cross for Australia , the first such decorations in forty years . Following a <unk> in forces , the last combat troops were withdrawn on 15 December 2013 ; however , approximately 400 personnel remain in Afghanistan as trainers and advisers , and are stationed in <unk> and <unk> . Over 26 @,@ 000 Australian personnel have served in Afghanistan . 
 Low @-@ level operations continued , however , with a small Australian force of 80 soldiers remaining in Iraq to protect the Australian Embassy in Baghdad as part of <unk> under Operation <unk> . <unk> was finally withdrawn in August 2011 , and was replaced by a private military company which took over responsibility for providing security for Australia 's diplomatic presence in Iraq . Although more than 17 @,@ 000 personnel served during operations in Iraq , Australian casualties were relatively light , with two soldiers accidentally killed , while a third Australian died serving with the British Royal Air Force . A further 27 personnel were wounded . Two officers remained in Iraq attached to the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq as part of Operation <unk> . This operation concluded in November 2013 . 
 Australia 's involvement in international peacekeeping operations has been diverse , and included participation in both United Nations sponsored missions , as well as those as part of ad @-@ hoc coalitions . Australians have been involved in more conflicts as peacekeepers than as <unk> ; however " in comparative international terms , Australia has only been a moderately energetic <unk> . " Although Australia has had peacekeepers in the field continuously for 60 years — being among the first group of UN military observers in Indonesia in 1947 — its commitments have generally been limited , consisting mostly of small numbers of high @-@ level and technical support troops such as <unk> , engineers , <unk> , observers , and police . One significant commitment has been Australia 's ongoing involvement with the long running <unk> Force and Observers in the Sinai . The operational tempo started increasing in the mid @-@ 1990s , when Australia became involved in a series of high @-@ profile operations , deploying significantly larger combat units in support of a number of missions including Cambodia , <unk> , Somalia , East Timor , and the Solomon Islands . Australia has been involved in close to 100 separate missions , involving more than 30 @,@ 000 personnel ; 14 Australians have died during these operations . 
 Ward <unk> Churchill ( born 1947 ) is an American author and political activist . He was a professor of ethnic studies at the University of Colorado Boulder from 1990 until 2007 . The primary focus of his work is on the historical treatment of political dissenters and Native Americans by the United States government . His work features controversial and provocative views , written in a direct , often <unk> style . 
 In January 2005 , Churchill 's work attracted controversy because of the circulation of a 2001 essay , " On the Justice of <unk> <unk> " , in which he argued the September 11 attacks were a natural and <unk> consequence of unlawful US foreign policy over the latter half of the 20th century ; the essay is well known for Churchill 's use of the phrase " little <unk> " to describe the " <unk> corps " working in the World Trade Center . 
 In March 2005 the University of Colorado began investigating allegations that Churchill had engaged in research <unk> ; it reported in June 2006 that he had done so . Churchill was fired on July 24 , 2007 , leading to a claim by some scholars that he was fired because of the " Little <unk> " comment . Churchill filed a lawsuit against the University of Colorado for unlawful termination of employment . In April 2009 a Denver jury found that Churchill was wrongly fired , <unk> him $ 1 in damages . In July 2009 , a District Court judge vacated the monetary award and declined Churchill 's request to order his <unk> , deciding the university has " quasi @-@ judicial immunity " . In February 2010 , Churchill appealed the judge 's decision . In November 2010 , the Colorado Court of Appeals upheld the lower @-@ court 's ruling . In September 10 , 2012 , the Colorado Supreme Court upheld the lower courts ' decisions in favor of the University of Colorado . On April 1 , 2013 , the United States Supreme Court declined to hear the case . 
 In a February 2014 interview , Churchill commented that after living more than forty years in the northern plains / Colorado region , he had relocated to Atlanta , Georgia in 2013 . Churchill also stated that he had a half @-@ dozen uncompleted books which he intended to finish and publish in the next three years . 
 Churchill was born in <unk> , Illinois , to Jack <unk> Churchill and <unk> <unk> Allen . His parents divorced before he was two , and he grew up in <unk> , where he attended local schools . 
 In 1966 , he was drafted into the United States Army . On his 1980 resume , he said he served as a public @-@ information specialist who " wrote and edited the battalion <unk> and wrote news releases . " 
 In a 1987 profile on Churchill , the Denver Post reported that he was drafted , went to paratrooper school , then volunteered for Vietnam , where he served a 10 @-@ month tour as Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol ( <unk> ) , one of a six @-@ man team sent out to track down the enemy . The Post article also reported that Churchill was politically <unk> as a result of his experiences in Vietnam . Churchill told the Post that he had spent some time at the Chicago office of the Students for a Democratic Society ( <unk> ) in the late 1960s , and briefly taught members of the Weather Underground how to build bombs and fire weapons . 
 In 2005 , the Denver Post reported that Churchill 's military records show he was trained as a film <unk> and light truck driver , but they do not reflect paratrooper school or <unk> training . The 75th Ranger Regiment Association found no record of Churchill having been a member of the unit , or a <unk> team . 
 Churchill received his <unk> in technological communications in 1974 and <unk> in communications theory in 1975 , both from <unk> State University , now the University of Illinois at Springfield . 
 In 1978 , Churchill began working at the University of Colorado Boulder as an <unk> action officer in the university administration . He also <unk> on American Indian issues in the ethnic studies program . In 1990 , the University of Colorado hired him as an associate professor , although he did not possess the academic doctorate usually required for the position . The following year he was granted tenure in the Communications department , without the usual six @-@ year <unk> period , after having been declined by the Sociology and Political Science departments . 
 He has long been interested in issues associated with the <unk> Act , which broke up the communal reservation lands and assigned plots to individual households . <unk> with that was the federal government 's first use of " blood quantum " to define individual membership in tribes , for what became known as the <unk> Rolls . Since re @-@ establishing self @-@ governments , <unk> recognized tribes have established their own criteria for enrollment as members , often related to descent from recognized historical lists , but less often requiring proofs of blood quantum . Some of his published works address these issues , which he has interpreted as part of the federal government 's policy of <unk> against Native Americans . 
 In 1996 , Churchill moved to the new <unk> Studies Department of the University of Colorado . In 1997 , he was promoted to full professor . He was selected as chairman of the department in June 2002 . 
 In January 2005 , during the controversy over his 9 / 11 remarks , Churchill resigned as chairman of the ethnic studies department at the University of Colorado — his term as chair was scheduled to <unk> in June of that year . On May 16 , 2006 , the <unk> Committee of the Standing Committee on Research <unk> at the University of Colorado concluded that Churchill had committed multiple counts of academic <unk> , specifically plagiarism , fabrication , and <unk> . On July 24 , 2007 , Churchill was fired for academic <unk> in an eight to one vote by the University of Colorado 's Board of <unk> . 
 In 2003 , Churchill stated , " I am myself of <unk> and Creek descent on my father 's side , <unk> on my mother 's , and am an enrolled member of the United <unk> Band of <unk> Indians . " In 1992 , Churchill wrote elsewhere that he is one @-@ eighth Creek and one @-@ sixteenth <unk> . In 1993 , Churchill told the Colorado Daily that " he was one @-@ sixteenth Creek and <unk> . " Churchill told the Denver Post in February 2005 that he is three @-@ <unk> <unk> . 
 In a statement dated May 9 , 2005 , and posted on its website , the United <unk> Band initially said , 
 Two days later , the United <unk> Band replaced its statement and acknowledged Churchill 's " alleged ancestry " of being <unk> : 
 " Because Mr. Churchill had genealogical information regarding his alleged ancestry , and his willingness to assist the <unk> in promoting the tribe and its causes , he was awarded an ' Associate <unk> ' as an honor , " the tribe 's website now said . " However , Mr. Churchill may possess eligibility status for <unk> Nation of Oklahoma , since he claims 1 / 16 <unk> . " 
 The tribe 's spokesperson , Lisa <unk> , stated the tribe <unk> only members with certified one @-@ quarter American Indian blood . The website statement further clarified that Churchill " was not eligible for tribal membership due to the fact that he does not possess a ' Certificate of <unk> of Indian Blood ( <unk> ) " , and the associate membership did not <unk> an individual to voting rights or enrollment in the tribe . 
 Churchill has never asked for <unk> certification , and finds the idea of being " <unk> " by the US government offensive . 
 In June 1994 , the United <unk> Band had voted to stop <unk> associate <unk> . Such honorary associate membership recognizes an individual 's assistance to the tribe , but it has nothing to do with Indian ancestry , and it does not <unk> an individual to vote in the tribe as a member . The <unk> Band states that Churchill still holds the associate membership and it has not been rescinded . In a separate interview , <unk> Berry , formerly on the tribe 's enrollment committee and four years on its council , said that Churchill had never fulfilled a promise to help the tribe . 
 In June 2005 , the Rocky Mountain News published an article about Churchill 's genealogy and family history . It " turned up no evidence of a single Indian ancestor " among 142 direct ancestors [ of Churchill 's ] identified from records . The News reported that both Churchill 's birth parents were listed as white on the 1930 census , as were all but two of his great @-@ great @-@ grandparents listed on previous census and other official documents . The News found that some of Churchill 's accounts of where his ancestors had lived did not agree with documented records . Numerous members of Churchill 's extended family have longstanding family legends of Indian ancestry among ancestors ; but , none was confirmed among the 142 direct forebears of Churchill who were identified . 
 <unk> in Churchill 's university personnel file show that he was granted tenure in a " special opportunity position . " In 1994 , then <unk> @-@ Boulder Chancellor James <unk> refused to take action on allegations that Churchill was <unk> claiming to be an Indian , saying " it has always been university policy that a person 's race or ethnicity is self @-@ proving . " 
 Some of Churchill 's Native American critics , such as Vernon <unk> ( White Earth Ojibwe ) and <unk> <unk> <unk> ( Southern Cheyenne @-@ <unk> Creek ) , argue that his assertion of Native American ancestry without the ability to prove it might constitute <unk> and grounds for termination . The University has said that it does not hire on the basis of ethnicity . The University of Colorado 's Research <unk> Committee conducted a preliminary investigation into whether Churchill misrepresented his ethnicity to " add credibility and public acceptance to his scholarship . " The committee concluded that the allegation was not " appropriate for further investigation under the definition of research <unk> . " 
 In a 2005 interview in The Rocky Mountain News , Churchill said , " I have never been confirmed as having one @-@ quarter blood , and never said I was . And even if [ the critics ] are absolutely right , what does that have to do with this issue ? I have never claimed to be <unk> <unk> Bull . " The longtime indigenous activist Russell <unk> said in February of that year , " So I want , from this day forward , every media person nationally , internationally and locally to know that we have <unk> that Ward Churchill is a full @-@ <unk> Indian leader . " 
 Churchill has responded to requests for <unk> of his claimed Indian heritage in various ways , including attacking the blood quantum upon which some Native American tribes establish their membership requirements . Churchill argues that the United States instituted blood quantum laws based upon rules of <unk> in order to further goals of personal <unk> and political <unk> . 
 For decades in his writings , Churchill has argued that blood quantum laws have an inherent <unk> purpose . He says , 
 " Set the blood quantum at one @-@ quarter , hold to it as a rigid definition of Indians , let <unk> proceed as it [ has ] and eventually Indians will be defined out of existence " . 
 Churchill 's <unk> have been raised as one of the several research @-@ <unk> allegations that were brought against him in 2005 ( see below ) . He has been accused of using his interpretation of the <unk> Act to attack tribal governments that would not recognize him as a member . 
 Churchill has written on American Indian history and culture , and speaks about <unk> inflicted on the indigenous people of the Americas by European settlers and what he describes as the repression of native peoples that continues to this day . 
 As of 2007 , according to a report submitted on his behalf , Churchill has written 10 books on his own and co @-@ authored 4 . Some have been reprinted with updates . He has written 51 book chapters , 3 law reviews , and 50 scholarly essays ; 27 of these were <unk> . He has edited 4 volumes and co @-@ edited 3 more . 
 According to the University of Colorado investigation , " His academic publications are nearly all works of synthesis and <unk> , drawing upon studies by other scholars , not <unk> describing new research based on primary sources . " The investigation also noted that " he has decided to publish largely in alternative presses or journals , not in the university presses or mainstream peer @-@ reviewed journals often favored by more conventional academics . " In addition to his academic writing , Churchill has written for several general readership magazines of political opinion . 
 In 1986 , Churchill wrote an essay titled <unk> as <unk> : Notes on an American <unk> criticizing pacifist politics within the U.S. left as being <unk> , de facto racist and <unk> . In 1998 , <unk> Ring Publishing published the essay in a book entitled <unk> as <unk> : Reflections on the Role of Armed <unk> in North America and listing Ward Churchill as the author . The book included a preface by Ed Mead , a new introduction to the essay by Churchill and a commentary by Mike Ryan . The book sparked much debate in leftist circles and inspired more aggressive tactics within the anti @-@ <unk> movement in the following few years . 
 Agents of <unk> ( 1988 ) , co @-@ authored by Jim <unk> Wall , describes what the authors claim was a secret war against the Black Panther Party and American Indian Movement carried out during the late 1960s and ' 70s by the FBI under the <unk> program . The <unk> <unk> ( 1990 ; reissued 2002 ) , also co @-@ authored with Jim <unk> Wall , examines a series of original FBI <unk> that detail the Bureau 's activities against various leftist groups , from the U.S. Communist Party in the 1950s to activists concerned with Central American issues in the 1980s . 
 In Fantasies of the Master Race ( 1992 ) , Churchill examines the portrayal of American Indians and the use of American Indian symbols in popular American culture . He focuses on such phenomena as Tony <unk> 's mystery novels , the film <unk> with Wolves , and the New Age movement , finding examples of cultural imperialism and exploitation . Churchill calls author Carlos <unk> 's claims of revealing the teachings of a <unk> Indian <unk> , the " greatest hoax since <unk> Man . " 
 <unk> for the Land ( 1993 ; reissued 2002 ) is a collection of essays in which Churchill chronicles what he describes as the U.S. government 's systematic exploitation of Native lands and the killing or displacement of American Indians . He details Native American efforts in the 19th and 20th centuries to prevent <unk> and industrial practices such as surface mining . 
 From a Native Son : Selected Essays on <unk> , 1985 – 1995 ( 1996 ) is a collection of 23 previously published essays on Native American history , culture , and political activism . In his introduction to this volume , Howard <unk> <unk> " the emergence of a new generation of Native @-@ American scholars " and describes Churchill 's writing as " powerful , <unk> , <unk> of <unk> and deception " . 
 Churchill 's A Little <unk> of <unk> ( 1997 ) is a survey of ethnic cleansing in the Americas from <unk> to the present . He compares the treatment of North American Indians to historical instances of <unk> by the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia , Turks against <unk> , and Europeans against the <unk> , as well as Nazis against the Poles and Jews . 
 In <unk> of Justice ( 2002 ) , Churchill argues that the U.S. ' s legal system was adapted to gain control over Native American people . <unk> the evolution of federal Indian law , Churchill argues that the principles set forth were not only applied to non @-@ Indians in the U.S. , but later adapted for application abroad . He concludes that this demonstrates the development of the U.S. ' s " imperial logic , " which depends on a " corrupt form of <unk> " to establish colonial control and empire . 
 Churchill 's controversial essay on 9 / 11 was expanded into a book @-@ length manuscript , published as On the Justice of <unk> <unk> : Reflections on the <unk> of U.S. Imperial <unk> and <unk> ( 2003 ) by AK Press . The book features two other chapters , one listing US military <unk> , another listing what Churchill believes to be US violations of international law . The original essay takes the " roosting chickens " of the title from a 1963 Malcolm X speech , in which Malcolm X linked the assassination of U.S. president John F. Kennedy to the violence which Kennedy <unk> as " merely a case of chickens coming home to roost . " Churchill 's essays in this book address the worldwide forms of resistance that he posits were and continue to be provoked by U.S. imperialism of the 20th and 21st centuries . 
 In Kill the Indian , Save the Man : The <unk> Impact of American Indian Residential Schools ( 2004 ) , Churchill traces the history of removing American Indian children from their homes to residential schools ( in Canada ) or Indian boarding schools ( in the USA ) as part of government policies ( 1880s – 1980s ) which he regards as <unk> . 
 Looking Cloud and Graham were convicted of murder in 2004 and 2010 , by federal and South Dakota state <unk> , respectively . By then Clark was being cared for in a nursing home and was not indicted . <unk> attributed the split in <unk> to divisions in the aftermath of <unk> 's murder . The journalist <unk> <unk> said in 1999 , " ... her [ <unk> 's ] death has divided the American Indian Movement ... " 
 Churchill has been a leader of Colorado <unk> 's annual protests in Denver against the Columbus Day holiday and its associated parade . Colorado <unk> 's leadership has come into conflict with some leaders in the Denver Italian American community , the main supporters of the parade . As early as 2004 , Churchill had claimed that such parades are unconstitutional , arguing that the <unk> Amendment to the Constitution provides Native Americans with a right not to be subjected to such displays , <unk> the First Amendment rights of non @-@ Native Americans . 
 Churchill wrote an essay in September 2001 entitled On the Justice of <unk> <unk> . In it , he argued that the September 11 attacks were provoked by U.S. foreign policy . He compared the role of financial workers at the World Trade Center in " ongoing <unk> American imperialism " to the role played by Adolf <unk> in organizing the Holocaust . In 2005 , this essay was widely publicized when Hamilton College invited Churchill to speak . This led to both condemnations of Churchill and counter @-@ accusations of <unk> by Churchill and supporters . Following the controversy , the University of Colorado interim Chancellor Phil <unk> said , " While Professor Churchill has the constitutional right to express his political views , his essay on 9 / 11 has outraged and <unk> us and the general public . " 
 A documentary called <unk> Fire : Stories from the Edge of Free Speech , broadcast on HBO , prominently features Churchill 's case in addressing the issues of free speech and First Amendment rights . 
 The controversy attracted increased academic attention to Churchill 's research , which had already been criticized by the legal scholar John <unk> and historian <unk> <unk> . Additional critics were the sociologist Thomas Brown , who had been preparing an article on Churchill 's work , and the historians <unk> Robertson and Russell <unk> , who claimed that Churchill had misrepresented their work . In 2005 , University of Colorado Boulder administrators ordered an investigation into seven allegations of research <unk> , including three allegations of plagiarism , and four allegations of fabrication or <unk> regarding the history of the <unk> Act , the Indian Arts and <unk> Act of 1990 , and statements that smallpox was intentionally spread to Native Americans by John Smith in <unk> and by the United States Army at Fort Clark in 1837 ( not to be confused with the well @-@ documented use of smallpox @-@ infected blankets at Fort Pitt in 1764 ) . 
 On May 16 , 2006 the University released their findings ; the <unk> Committee agreed unanimously that Churchill had engaged in " serious research <unk> " , including <unk> , fabrication , and two of the three allegations of plagiarism . The committee was divided on the appropriate level of sanctions . The Standing Committee on Research <unk> accepted the findings of the <unk> Committee but also disagreed on what sanctions should be imposed . Churchill 's appeal against his proposed dismissal was considered by a panel of the University 's <unk> and <unk> Committee , which found that two of the seven findings of <unk> did not constitute <unk> offences . Three members recommended that the penalty should be demotion and one year 's suspension without pay , while two favored dismissal . 
 On July 24 , 2007 , the University <unk> voted seven to two to uphold all seven of the findings of research <unk> , <unk> the recommendation of <unk> and <unk> panel that two be dismissed . By a vote of eight to one , the <unk> determined to fire Churchill . 
 The next day , Churchill filed a lawsuit in state court claiming that the firing was <unk> for his expressing politically unpopular views . The jury in Churchill 's suit for <unk> weighed the university 's claims of academic <unk> per jury instructions it received in the case . As Stanley Fish said , " It was the jury ’ s task to determine whether Churchill ’ s dismissal would have occurred independently of the adverse political response to his <unk> protected statements . " The jury found that the alleged <unk> would not have led to Churchill 's firing and rejected the university 's academic <unk> claim as the grounds for dismissal . On April 1 , 2009 , a Colorado jury found that Churchill had been wrongly fired , and awarded $ 1 in damages . As one of the jurors said later in a press interview , " it wasn 't a <unk> in his face or anything like that when we didn 't give him any money . It 's just that [ Churchill 's attorney ] David Lane kept saying this wasn 't about the money , and in the end , we took his word for that . " Churchill 's counsel asked Chief Judge Larry J. <unk> of the Denver District Court to order <unk> in light of the verdict . 
 On July 7 , 2009 , Judge <unk> found that the defendants ( university ) were entitled to quasi @-@ judicial immunity as a matter of law , vacated the jury verdict and determined that the University did not owe Churchill any financial compensation . <unk> denied Churchill 's request for <unk> at <unk> . 
 Churchill appealed both decisions . On November 24 , 2010 , a three @-@ judge panel of the Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court 's decision . In February 2011 , Churchill filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the Colorado Supreme Court . In late May 2011 , the Colorado Supreme Court agreed to hear his case . Court records indicate that oral arguments began June 7 , 2012 . On September 10 , 2012 , the court ruled that the University had " quasi @-@ judicial immunity " , upholding the trial court 's ruling . On April 1 , 2013 , the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal from Churchill .

 Churchill 's subjects are often American Indian figures and other themes associated with Native American Culture . He uses historical photographs as source material for works . In the early 1990s at Santa Fe Indian Market , Churchill protested the passage of the 1990 Indian Arts and <unk> Act . It requires that , to identify and exhibit works as being by a Native American , artists and craftsmen must be enrolled in a Native American tribe or designated by a tribe as an <unk> . Under federal law , Churchill cannot identify his art as by a Native American . 
 Some of Churchill 's pieces may <unk> <unk> . For example , his 1981 <unk> Winter Attack was , according to Churchill and others , based on a 1972 drawing by the artist Thomas E. <unk> Churchill printed 150 copies of Winter Attack and sold at least one of them . Other copies are available online for purchase . Churchill says that , when he produced Winter Attack , he publicly acknowledged that it was based on <unk> ' work . The online journal <unk> mentions Churchill 's artwork and the controversy surrounding its originality . 
 " Exit Through the <unk> @-@ E @-@ Mart " is the fifteenth episode of the twenty @-@ third season of the American animated television sitcom The Simpsons . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 4 , 2012 . In the episode , Bart is punished by Homer after causing trouble . He gets revenge on his father by <unk> @-@ painting images of him with the word " <unk> " all over Springfield . Street artist Shepard <unk> encounters Bart one night and offers him a gallery show of Bart 's artworks . However , Chief <unk> suddenly appears during the show and arrests Bart for covering the town in graffiti . It turns out that <unk> is an undercover officer working for <unk> . 
 The episode references the 2010 street art documentary Exit Through the Gift Shop by graffiti artist <unk> , and features guest appearances from street artists Ron English , Kenny <unk> , and Robbie <unk> as themselves . <unk> , who is a long @-@ time fan of The Simpsons , also guest starred in the episode as himself . Around 5 @.@ 09 million Americans tuned in to watch " Exit Through the <unk> @-@ E @-@ Mart " during its original broadcast . Since then , the episode has received praise from television critics for its opening sequence , which parodies the opening sequence of the medieval fantasy television series Game of <unk> . 
 Homer initially refuses to attend Bart 's show because he discovers the artwork is an insult to him , but changes his mind after Bart apologizes and writes " I 'm sorry " on the hood of Homer 's car . At the show , Chief <unk> and the Springfield Police Department suddenly appear to arrest Bart for making graffiti throughout the town . It is revealed that the gallery show is a <unk> and that <unk> is an undercover officer who helped the police identify Bart as the graffiti artist that had been <unk> @-@ painting Springfield . Since Bart is just a boy , he is not sent to jail . Instead , he is punished by once again being locked up in the <unk> cage . When Bart tells <unk> that he has to go to the bathroom , <unk> covers the cage with the blanket and finds Bart gone when he removes the blanket from the cage . 
 American street artist <unk> guest starred in " Exit Through the <unk> @-@ E @-@ Mart " as himself . The graffiti art featuring Homer 's face and the word " <unk> " that Bart creates in the episode is a reference to <unk> 's Barack Obama " Hope " poster and his <unk> Giant image . <unk> has said that The Simpsons has been one of his favorite television shows since the early 1990s because of its " blend of humor and social commentary " , and he felt " deeply honored " to be included in an episode . <unk> wrote on his website that " Part of being on The Simpsons , is you ’ re being honored as a reference point in culture . " He described the plot of the episode as " great " , adding that the staff members of the show " were kind enough to indulge a couple of my dialogue suggestions designed to make the social commentary more pointed ( even though I had to make fun of myself to do so ) . " This was <unk> 's first acting performance . Street artists English , <unk> , and <unk> also guest starred in the episode as themselves . 
 " Exit Through the <unk> @-@ E @-@ Mart " was originally broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on March 4 , 2012 . It was watched by approximately 5 @.@ 09 million people during this broadcast , and in the demographic for adults aged 18 – 49 , the episode received a 2 @.@ 5 Nielsen rating and a seven percent share . This was a slight decrease from the previous episode , " At Long Last Leave " , which acquired a 2 @.@ 6 rating . The episode became the second highest @-@ rated broadcast in Fox 's Animation <unk> lineup for the night in terms of both total viewers and in the 18 – 49 demographic , finishing higher than new episodes of American Dad ! , Napoleon <unk> , and The Cleveland Show , but lower than a new Family Guy episode ( which received a 2 @.@ 8 rating and was seen by 5 @.@ 33 million people ) . For the week of February 27 – March 4 , 2012 , " Exit Through the <unk> @-@ E @-@ Mart " placed 25th in the ratings among all prime @-@ time broadcasts in the 18 – 49 demographic , and seventh among all Fox prime @-@ time broadcasts . 
 The <unk> Boat Race took place on 29 March 2008 . Held annually , the event is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames . Oxford won the race . Oxford 's crew featured the oldest competitor in Boat Race history . The race took place in very difficult weather conditions – strong winds and heavy rain – resulting in the slowest winning time in over sixty years . Oxford won by six lengths , the largest margin of victory since the 2004 race . 
 Oxford 's Isis beat Cambridge 's Goldie in the reserve race , while Oxford won the Women 's Boat Race . 
 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . First held in 1829 , the race takes place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide . Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions , having beaten Oxford by over a length in the previous year 's race and the overall lead , with 79 victories to Oxford 's 73 . The race was sponsored by <unk> for the fourth time . 
 The first Women 's Boat Race took place in 1927 , but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s . Until 2014 , the contest was conducted as part of the <unk> Boat Races , but as of the 2015 race , it is held on the River Thames , on the same day as the men 's main and reserve races . The reserve race , contested between Oxford 's Isis boat and Cambridge 's Goldie boat has been held since 1965 . It usually takes place on the <unk> , prior to the main Boat Race . 
 Oxford 's crew weighed an average of 12 pounds ( 5 @.@ 4 kg ) more per rower than their opponents , and featured the oldest competitor in Boat Race history in 36 @-@ year @-@ old American Mike <unk> . Cambridge crew consisted of six Britons , two Australians and an American , while Oxford 's comprised four Americans , three Britons , an Australian and a German . Both <unk> , Nick <unk> and Rebecca <unk> , were former Blues , while Cambridge also saw 30 @-@ year @-@ old Tom Edwards return , having rowed in 2006 . Cambridge 's boat club president Dan O <unk> was the seventh Light Blue president not to row in his own Blue Boat . 
 Oxford were pre @-@ race favourites , but Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station . Oxford took an early lead , but the boats closed on each other , and <unk> John Garrett was forced to issue a number of warnings to both <unk> in an attempt to prevent a collision . By <unk> <unk> , Oxford were nearly a length ahead and Cambridge responded ; by the time the crews passed under <unk> Bridge they were level . Along <unk> <unk> Oxford moved ahead once again , and were clear of Cambridge after 30 <unk> . Oxford extended their lead to pass the finishing post in 20 minutes 53 seconds , six lengths and 22 seconds ahead of their opponents . Driving rain , strong winds and <unk> water resulted in the slowest winning time for over sixty years , but the largest margin of victory since the 2004 race . 
 Oxford 's Isis beat Cambridge 's Goldie by three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ quarter lengths in the reserve race . Oxford won the 44th running of the Women 's Boat Race by half a length . 
 Oxford 's Oliver Moore said " we got the rage going in the crew , and we started to kill it , we hit an awesome rhythm " . Cambridge coach Duncan Holland <unk> his opponents : " Well done to Oxford , they were much faster on the day " . Following tradition , the victorious Oxford crew tossed their <unk> <unk> into the Thames . 
 Fort Scott National Historic Site is a historical area under the control of the United States National Park Service in Bourbon County , Kansas , United States . Named after General Winfield Scott , who achieved <unk> during the Mexican @-@ American War , during the middle of the 19th century the fort served as a military base for US Army action in what was the edge of settlement in 1850 . For the next quarter century , it was used as a supply base and to provide security in turbulent areas during the opening of the West to settlement , a period which included Bleeding Kansas and the American Civil War . 
 The current national historic site protects 20 historic structures , a parade ground , and five acres ( 20 @,@ 000 m ² ) of restored <unk> prairie , inside the city of Fort Scott . It is open to visitors most days of the year . 
 In 1842 , Fort Scott was named after Winfield Scott , was established on the American frontier on the military road in eastern Kansas between Fort <unk> and Fort Gibson . It was established to provide protection to the rapidly increasing number of settlers , who were migrating from the Eastern United States . Fort Scott became one of a chain of forts intended to protect the new settlers from the Plains Indians , as well as to protect the Indians from the settlers ' encroachment . 
 The United States government intention to reserve permanent Indian lands west of the Missouri River gave way to the competition of settlers continuing to <unk> on the Indian settlements . Fort Scott 's most active days were between 1842 and 1853 , although it was also used during the Civil War . 
 The <unk> of Indian Territory ( now Oklahoma ) were upset to have Fort Wayne in their proximity . After some delay , the US Army decided to abandon Fort Wayne and move its soldiers to a new fort to be built between Fort <unk> and the site . The Army both wanted to <unk> the <unk> ( who were supervised by the Department of Defense ) and provide more defense for white settlers and other Indians against the Osage , who had been conducting frequent raids in the area . On April 1 , 1842 , some soldiers of Fort Wayne left their fort and on April 22 arrived where Fort Scott would be built , in the Osage <unk> section of modern @-@ day Kansas . After <unk> with the <unk> to acquire the land , the rest of Fort Wayne 's garrison left the fort on May 26 and arrived at the Fort Scott site on May 30 . 
 Unlike most forts for military use , the fort did not have defensive walls or structures when first built ; the wide @-@ open area and the available artillery made an enclosed fort unnecessary . The soldiers concentrated on building structures for lodging the men , animals , and equipment . These buildings were on the edges of a 350 @-@ foot ( 110 m ) parade ground . 
 The post <unk> , Captain Thomas Swords , was in charge of building Fort Scott 's structures , and had to deal with the problems of construction on the Kansas prairie , which had few trees . He had only two <unk> and three carpenters to rely on , as there were few civilians and most of the soldiers had other duties to perform . Wood was available , but the mill was built 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) away , making transport time consuming . Swords found his efforts plagued by lack of wood , skilled labor and working equipment . Freak accidents destroyed much of the wood intended for the fort 's construction . As a result , only one <unk> of the five planned officers quarters ( four <unk> and post commandant 's house ) was built by 1844 , and the intended enlisted barracks were not completed . In his 1844 inspection of the fort , Colonel George <unk> reported that , in comparison to other frontier forts , he considered Fort Scott " above average " . 
 Due to the rising tensions that escalated in the Mexican @-@ American War , the US Army redeployed troops to the Southwest . With Fort Scott still uncompleted , officials decided on April 25 , 1850 , that no more construction would be done there , after eight years and $ 35 @,@ 000 . By the time it was finished , it was obsolete ; three years later , it was abandoned by the military in favor of the more western Fort Riley . 
 For the average soldier , life at the fort was " <unk> " . Until the permanent structures were built , soldiers had to live in tents , which lacked comfort . Aside from a few whiskey <unk> and prostitutes , few civilians lived at the fort . Officers had brought their personal slaves with them , including Captain Swords . Five miles East in Missouri was a <unk> shop that supplied soldiers , and quite a few courts @-@ martial followed soldiers ' going <unk> at the shop . The <unk> rate from the fort ranged from 12 % <unk> % , due to boredom , irregular pay , and hatred for military life . As no combat took place near the fort , it seemed more of a frontier village than a military base . Hunting was a popular <unk> ; according to Captain Swords , " wolf chasing and duck hunting " was the only way one officer could tolerate the place . 
 Two years after the army abandoned the fort , the buildings were sold by auction to civilians , with two being converted to hotels . In 1854 the Kansas @-@ Nebraska Act repealed the Missouri <unk> of 1820 , which had kept slavery out of Kansas . <unk> in favor of slavery soon moved to Kansas to try to sway the vote of whether or not Kansas would permit slavery . Settlers from New England arrived equally determined to keep it out . Each of the two competing factions of the Bleeding Kansas conflict claimed one of the hotels at Fort Scott : Free @-@ Soil at the Fort Scott Hotel and Pro @-@ <unk> at the Western Hotel . Most of the residents in Fort Scott supported slavery , but those outside the town tended to the free @-@ soil side . During this time , there were local incidents of murder and attempted <unk> , typical elements of the guerrilla conflicts that were prevalent in the fighting . 
 During the American Civil War , the fort was renewed as a US military post . In August 1861 , the Union Army took command of Fort Scott , and <unk> it for the war times . The United States Army also took over several blocks within the town for <unk> and <unk> functions . The Union Army rented the properties from the current civilian owners . Troops from Indiana , Iowa , Colorado , Ohio , and Wisconsin would come to the fort , and either stayed by the fort , or traveled farther , to <unk> Missouri , Arkansas , or the Indian Territory . Fort Scott was one of the few installations that recruited and trained black soldiers for the United States <unk> Troops of the Union Army . 
 A major supply depot was situated at the fort . Confederate general Sterling Price hoped to capture the town , but the closest the Confederate force came to the garrison was 10 miles ( 16 km ) away at Battle of Dry Wood Creek . The site was strategically important as it was within a Southern @-@ <unk> area and close to the Confederate state of Arkansas and the " unstable " Indian Territory ( present @-@ day state of Oklahoma ) , where many of the members of the Five <unk> <unk> were allied with the Confederates . The fort served as a " general hospital " ( large military hospital ) and prison until after the war . Following the end of the war , in October 1865 the US Army left the facilities and sold off by auction what they controlled . 
 On January 14 , 1870 , the Army returned with the formation of the Post of Southeast Kansas . The Post was based at Fort Scott , but the soldiers camped along the rail tracks , and seldom used the original fort . They were sent to protect the railroads and workers from settlers . Some of the latter feared that the railroad , which had been awarded land for development by the US Government in rights @-@ of @-@ way , would evict them from their <unk> homes . The settlers considered the troops <unk> to the railroads , and <unk> both as enemies . 
 Settlers also had some continuing conflicts with Indians and insurgents using the recent Confederate cause as excuse for robbery . By the spring of 1873 , the US Army withdrew the troops from Fort Scott for good . From 1873 to 1965 , the buildings of the fort were left <unk> , and slowly deteriorated . Many military buildings were razed and replaced with structures built for civilian use . 
 With the Act of August 31 , 1965 , the National Park Service gave the city government of Fort Scott , Kansas the necessary funds and technical knowledge to restore the fort . 
 On October 19 , 1978 , Fort Scott became a National Historic Site under the supervision of the National Park Service , encompassing 17 acres ( 69 @,@ 000 m2 ) . Today the fort is open throughout the year , save for <unk> , Christmas , and New Years Day . <unk> has declined in recent years . In 2005 visitation was 25 @,@ <unk> ; in 2007 it was 22 @,@ 314 . 
 Surviving structures include four officers ' barracks , one <unk> 's barracks , two infantry barracks , a hospital , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , ordnance and post headquarters , <unk> <unk> , <unk> shop , flagpole , and magazine . Another feature of the park is 5 acres ( 2 @.@ 0 ha ) of <unk> prairie restored as part of an ecology @-@ restoration project . 
 <unk> ( 2008 ) was a professional wrestling pay @-@ per @-@ view ( <unk> ) event produced by the Total Nonstop Action Wrestling ( TNA ) promotion that took place on June 8 , 2008 at the <unk> Civic Center in <unk> , Mississippi . It was the fourth event under the <unk> name and the sixth event in the 2008 TNA <unk> schedule . Seven professional wrestling matches and one dark match were featured on the event 's card , three of which were for championships . The event commemorated TNA 's six year anniversary . 
 <unk> is remembered for Joe being the first to retain a championship in a King of the Mountain match . The reported figure of <unk> for the event was 20 @,@ 000 , as reported by The Wrestling Observer <unk> . <unk> had an attendance of 2 @,@ 000 people . Jon <unk> of the professional wrestling section of the Canadian Online Explorer rated the show a 7 out of 10 , which was lower than the 8 out of 10 given to the 2007 edition by Jason <unk> . After the event , an accident occurred which resulted in the death of one man and the injury of another . 
 <unk> featured seven professional wrestling matches and one pre @-@ show match that involved different wrestlers from pre @-@ existing scripted <unk> and storylines . <unk> portrayed villains , heroes , or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches . 
 The predominate storyline heading into the event was the rivalry between <unk> <unk> and Kurt Angle , both members of The Angle Alliance group . On the February 14 episode of Impact ! , TNA held the scripted wedding of Angle 's real @-@ life wife Karen Angle and <unk> despite Angle and Karen still being married on @-@ screen . Afterwards , Karen and Angle separated in the storyline on the March 13 episode of Impact ! . TNA continued to build the situation with Angle attempting to reconcile with Karen on the May 15 episode of Impact ! . Karen refused Angle 's request on the May 22 episode of Impact ! , leading to Angle turning on and assaulting <unk> later in the episode due to his jealousy of the affection Karen showed for <unk> . On the May 29 episode of Impact ! , <unk> announced Angle versus <unk> for the event . Angle sustained a severe neck injury in early May with several TNA officials believing Angle would not recover in time to perform at the show . Angle was still in pain a few days prior to <unk> but was expected to perform normally despite some officials feeling it was too soon to compete . 
 TNA held a match to warm – up the crowd known as a dark match prior to the show <unk> The Motor City Machine Guns ( Alex Shelley and Chris <unk> ) against the team of Lance Hoyt and Johnny <unk> . The Motor City Machine Guns won the encounter . 
 The TNA X Division Championship was defended by then @-@ champion <unk> Williams against <unk> in the opening contest of the telecast . Williams was accompanied by <unk> Khan and Scott Steiner . The duration of the bout was 15 minutes and 19 seconds . Williams wore a protective face mask due to a broken orbital bone . Khan and Steiner <unk> in the bout several times . <unk> was legitimately <unk> open during the match after Williams <unk> him in the face with a steel pipe . Williams won the encounter after performing his signature Canadian Destroyer maneuver by <unk> <unk> head @-@ first into the mat to retain the TNA X Division Championship . Abyss returned after this match by aiding <unk> who was being attacked by Khan , Steiner , and Williams . 
 The team of The Beautiful People and <unk> <unk> — renamed Moose — fought the team of <unk> Kim , <unk> , and <unk> in a Six Woman Tag Team match next . It lasted 10 minutes and 14 seconds . <unk> won the bout for her team after running and <unk> Moose against the mat back @-@ first and following with the pin . 
 The TNA World Tag Team Championship was defended in the third match of the event by <unk> against Team 3D . <unk> Guerrero and <unk> accompanied <unk> to the ring . <unk> , Guerrero , and Team 3D 's associate Johnny <unk> all <unk> in the encounter . Near the end when Team 3D were waiting to perform their signature 3D tag team maneuver on <unk> , <unk> came up behind Devon and pinned him with a schoolboy pin at 15 minutes to retain the championship . 
 <unk> felt that " TNA put on a strong <unk> " that was in " large part to little <unk> . " Regarding the main event , <unk> gave it a 6 out of 10 , while the World Tag Team Championship match received a 4 out of 10 . He gave the Six Woman Tag Team match a 4 @.@ 5 out of 10 and the <unk> <unk> versus Kurt Angle bout a 9 out of 10 . The X Division Championship contest was given a 7 out of 10 . 
 Wade <unk> of the Pro Wrestling <unk> <unk> reviewed the show . He felt the main event had " lots of action and drama , " but that having to hang the belt on a hook does not make for a " particularly dramatic end to a match as it seems like someone hanging a plant in the corner " than " beating someone to win a fight . " <unk> said the World Tag Team Championship contest was a " solid tag match " with some " elaborate sequences " that were " well executed . " <unk> stated that the X Division Championship match was a " very good opener . " Regarding the <unk> and Angle bout , <unk> commented that it was a " good match , but short of a classic must @-@ see match in part because there were too many <unk> mid @-@ match from Angle that took the crowd out of it . " 
 After <unk> ended , crews began to <unk> the set used for the event . During this time , a man named Kevin " Angus " <unk> was removing a light array when the scaffolding he was positioned on collapsed , causing him to slam against the concrete floor below . He was rushed to the Baptist <unk> Hospital in <unk> , Mississippi where he was pronounced deceased . Another worker named Paul Martin was also taken to the hospital due to his thumb being cut off in the incident . TNA released a statement regarding the incident the next day through their website . The June 12 episode of Impact ! was dedicated to <unk> , with a banner at the beginning of the show stating " In memory Kevin <unk> ( 1963 – 2008 ) " . A moment of silence was held prior to the Impact ! <unk> after <unk> in honor of <unk> . 
 Several wrestlers were concerned with Kurt Angle 's health going into his <unk> match with <unk> <unk> . Despite the concerns , Angle appeared to be out of it after the contest but was expected to be <unk> . 
 Samoa Joe and Booker T started a rivalry over the TNA World Heavyweight Championship following <unk> . On the June 12 episode of Impact ! , Booker T claimed that Joe did not beat him at the event due to interference from Kevin Nash . This led to Nash stating that Joe could not beat Booker T in a one @-@ on @-@ one match later in the broadcast . After this segment , Joe announced that Booker T and he would face at Victory Road on July 13 for the title . On the July 10 episode of Impact ! , Sting proclaimed that he did not know which of the two would win at Victory Road , but that he would be there to watch . At the event , Joe beat Booker T till he was bloody , causing several <unk> and security personnel to try to stop him to no <unk> . He was stopped when Sting <unk> in the contest by bashing Joe with a baseball bat . Booker T then covered Joe for an unofficial pinfall victory that was counted by Booker T 's legitimate wife <unk> . The match result was ruled a no @-@ contest , with Joe retaining the title . 
 After <unk> , <unk> went on to captain Team TNA in the 2008 TNA World X Cup Tournament . He competed in a Four Way Ultimate X match at Victory Road as the final round of the tournament . He was unsuccessful in winning the match and gaining the appropriate points to win the tournament , thus causing Team TNA ( <unk> , Alex Shelley , Chris <unk> , and Curry Man ) to finish in second place , with Team Mexico ( <unk> , Rey <unk> , Último Guerrero , and <unk> Jr . ) being the victors in point rankings . 
 Home Made <unk> Pie is a 1910 American silent short comedy produced by the Thanhouser Company . The film is a comedy of circumstances , in which the Gale family is going to host a dinner . The focus of the humor is in a <unk> <unk> that brandy is added to in an attempt to make it more <unk> , but three people each add brandy to the <unk> . Everyone becomes <unk> upon eating the <unk> , including the family cat , and the film concludes . No cast or staff credits for this film are known . The film was released on September 27 , 1910 , to mixed reviews in trade publications . Reviewers mentioned that the film was too long and it was unbelievable that one <unk> split eight ways would be able to impact everyone . The film is presumed lost . 
 Though the film is presumed lost , a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from September 24 , 1910 . It states : " Life in a country town is often tedious and <unk> , and were it not for the little <unk> and <unk> the <unk> are constantly given , existence in some localities would be a very dreary thing indeed . So the time honored get @-@ <unk> of the small town are an established feature to the social calendar ; they are just as much a matter of necessity and as such have come to stay . The <unk> thought well of this established feature . They made it a <unk> occasion for themselves as well as their guests . They were hardly an overly wealthy family , and their table was never notable for an <unk> of the good things of life , but whenever they gave a dinner they cast all thoughts of economy to the country winds and worked to the one end that their guests have a pleasant time . " 
 The writer of the scenario is unknown , but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan . He was an experienced <unk> employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions . The film director is unknown , but it may have been Barry O 'Neil . Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production , but at least two possible candidates exist . Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company , but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer . The role of the cameraman was <unk> in 1910 productions . The cast credits are unknown , but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary . In late 1910 , the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films . The list includes <unk> <unk> , <unk> D. Barnes , Frank H. Crane , Irene Crane , Marie <unk> , <unk> <unk> , Martin J. Faust , Thomas Fortune , George Middleton , Grace Moore , John W. Noble , Anna <unk> , Mrs. George Walters . A surviving film still gives the possibility of identifying eight actors . 
 The single reel comedy , approximately 1 @,@ 000 feet long , was released on September 27 , 1910 . The film likely had a wide national release , with advertisements in theaters known in Indiana , Kansas , Wisconsin , and Pennsylvania . The film would also be shown in Vancouver , Canada and was met with praise by the audience at the Province Theatre . In 1917 , years after the film 's release , the film was approved without censorship by the Pennsylvania State Board of <unk> of Moving Pictures . 
 " Back Off <unk> " is a song by English musician <unk> Starr , released as a non @-@ album single in March 1972 . Starr 's former Beatles <unk> George Harrison produced the recording , which took place in London shortly after the two had appeared together at Harrison 's Concert for Bangladesh shows in August 1971 . The single was a follow @-@ up to Starr 's 1971 hit song " It Don 't Come Easy " and continued his successful run as a solo artist . " Back Off <unk> " peaked at number 2 in Britain and Canada , and number 9 on America 's Billboard Hot 100 . It remains Starr 's highest @-@ charting single in the United Kingdom . 
 The title for the song was inspired by English singer @-@ songwriter Marc <unk> . Some commentators have suggested that the lyrics were directed at Paul McCartney , reflecting Starr 's disdain for the music McCartney had made as a solo artist over the previous two years . " Back Off <unk> " demonstrates the influence of <unk> rock on Starr , who directed a documentary film , Born to Boogie ( 1972 ) , about <unk> 's band T. Rex around this time . Described by one author as a " high @-@ energy in @-@ your @-@ face rocker " , the song features a prominent slide guitar part by Harrison and contributions from musicians Gary Wright and Klaus <unk> . 
 Starr re @-@ recorded " Back Off <unk> " for his 1981 album Stop and <unk> the Roses , in a collaboration with American singer Harry Nilsson that incorporates lyrics from Beatles songs such as " With a Little Help from My Friends " , " Good Day Sunshine " and " Baby , You 're a Rich Man " . The original version has appeared on Starr 's compilation albums <unk> from Your Past and <unk> : The Very Best of <unk> Starr , and as a bonus track on his remastered 1974 studio album <unk> Vienna . Since his return to touring in 1989 , Starr has performed " Back Off <unk> " regularly in concert with the various <unk> of his All @-@ Starr Band . 
 The lyrics to the middle eight of " Back Off <unk> " came to Starr while watching London Weekend Television 's football show , The Big Match . The program 's host , Jimmy Hill , often referred to a footballer 's playing as " <unk> " , a catchphrase that Starr incorporated into his song lyrics : 
 Commentators have interpreted the song , and particularly this statement , as an attack by Starr on his former Beatles <unk> Paul McCartney . Starr has denied any such interpretation , instead " claiming that the song was inspired by <unk> and nothing more " , Beatles biographer Robert Rodriguez writes . Starr had publicly criticised McCartney 's solo albums McCartney ( 1970 ) and Ram ( 1971 ) on release , and author Bruce <unk> <unk> the message of the middle eight as " a plea for Paul to produce better music " . The mention of " sound [ ing ] wasted " could also be a reference to McCartney 's <unk> with cannabis , Rodriguez suggests . A further example of Starr 's allegedly anti @-@ McCartney message exists in the song 's first verse : 
 The same commentators suggest that here Starr could be referring to the 1969 " Paul Is Dead " hoax . The latter <unk> circulated during September and October of that year while McCartney hid away on his Scottish farm , <unk> after John Lennon had told him and Starr that he wanted a " divorce " from the Beatles . 
 In addition to these supposed messages in " Back Off <unk> " , observers have viewed the song title as Starr 's <unk> to McCartney to abandon his legal stand against the Beatles and Apple Corps , which was placed in receivership in March 1971 after a High Court judge found in McCartney 's favour . Author Keith <unk> writes that " <unk> " had " long been cited as Paul 's nickname " from his former bandmates Starr , Lennon and George Harrison . While acknowledging that in subsequent years Starr might have chosen to minimise any ill @-@ feeling towards McCartney , Rodriguez notes that the lyrics " just happened to fit perfectly into the ' us vs. Paul ' mindset " following the Beatles ' break @-@ up , to the extent that " Back Off <unk> " was " as <unk> as ' Early 1970 ' had been <unk> " . When <unk> his 1970 composition " I 'm the Greatest " for Starr to record on the album <unk> ( 1973 ) , Lennon referenced the song title with the lines " Now I 'm only thirty @-@ two / And all I want to do is <unk> " . 
 Although " T Rex devotees " , in the words of Starr biographer Alan <unk> , claimed that <unk> had ghost @-@ written " Back Off <unk> " , Starr later acknowledged that Harrison co @-@ wrote the song by adding some chords and finishing the melody . As on Starr 's 1971 hit single " It Don 't Come Easy " , Harrison was not credited for his songwriting contribution . Starr originally offered " Back Off <unk> " to fellow <unk> <unk> Black to record , but she declined , hoping instead to record another new Starr – Harrison composition , " <unk> " . 
 Having earmarked the song as his next single , Starr recorded " Back Off <unk> " in September 1971 , following his appearance at the Harrison @-@ organised Concert for Bangladesh in New York . The sessions took place at Apple Studio in central London , with Harrison producing , as he had on " It Don 't Come Easy " . The recording reflects the influence of <unk> rock on Starr through what authors <unk> <unk> and Mark Easter term " its big drum sound and <unk> nature " , with a line @-@ up comprising Starr ( vocals , drums , percussion ) , Harrison ( guitars ) , Gary Wright ( piano ) and Klaus <unk> ( bass , saxophone ) . 
 Rodriguez describes Starr 's " martial @-@ sounding opening " as a rare " showcase for his own drumming " , while Harrison biographer Simon <unk> writes of " a <unk> series of Harrison slide breaks that brought to mind <unk> <unk> " . Further overdubs included contributions from three backing vocalists , led by American soul singer Madeline Bell . 
 Apple Records issued the single on 17 March 1972 in Britain , as Apple R <unk> , with a US release taking place three days later , as Apple 1849 . It was Starr 's first release since " It Don 't Come Easy " , a year before . During this period , his priority had been to develop a career as an actor in films such as 200 <unk> ( 1971 ) and <unk> . Further <unk> himself with Britain 's <unk> rock movement , Starr made his directorial debut with Born to Boogie ( 1972 ) , a film starring <unk> that included Starr 's footage of a T. Rex concert held at Wembley on 18 March . With " Back Off <unk> " , NME critic Bob <unk> noted Starr 's success in establishing himself in the two years since the Beatles ' break @-@ up , and wrote that the single " confirmed that he and Harrison , dark horses both , were the ones who had managed their solo careers more purposefully and <unk> " compared with McCartney and Lennon . 
 The song was a hit in the US , reaching number 9 on the Billboard Hot 100 , and achieved Starr 's best position on the UK Singles Chart , where it reached number 2 . A promotional video for " Back Off <unk> " was shot on 20 March at Lennon 's Tittenhurst Park residence while Starr was looking after the property . The video , which shows Starr walking around an outdoor structure and followed by a <unk> @-@ like monster , was directed by Tom Taylor and financed by <unk> Films . A similar monster appeared on the single 's picture sleeve , holding a cigarette . 
 Re @-@ releases for " Back Off <unk> " include Starr 's 1975 greatest hits album , <unk> from Your Past , and , along with " <unk> " , as a bonus track on the 1992 reissue of his <unk> Vienna album ( 1974 ) . " Back Off <unk> " also appeared on his 2007 compilation <unk> : The Very Best of <unk> Starr , the collector 's edition of which included his 1972 video for the song . 
 Starr recorded a new version of " Back Off <unk> " for his 1981 album on <unk> Records , Stop and <unk> the Roses . The song was produced by Starr 's friend , singer Harry Nilsson , and features a musical arrangement by Van <unk> Parks . Similar to Nilsson 's 1968 cover of the Beatles ' " You Can 't Do That " , the remake incorporates lyrics from a number of the band 's songs – in this case , " With a Little Help from My Friends " , " Help ! " , " Lady Madonna " , " Good Day Sunshine " and " Baby , You 're a Rich Man " , as well as Starr 's " It Don 't Come Easy " . In a further reference to his past , the 1981 version of " Back Off <unk> " opens with the same guitar riff that Harrison had played on " It Don 't Come Easy " ten years before . 
 Starr taped the basic track at <unk> Recording Studios in Los Angeles on 4 November 1980 , with additional recording taking place on 1 – 5 December at Nassau 's <unk> Point Studios . Among the large cast of musicians supporting Starr were Nilsson ( vocals ) , Jim <unk> ( drums ) , Jane <unk> ( piano ) , Dennis <unk> and Richie <unk> ( guitars ) , and a four @-@ piece horn section led by saxophonist Jerry <unk> . 
 Starr <unk> his vocals on 4 December , four days before the murder of John Lennon , who had been due to record his contributions to Stop and <unk> the Roses in January 1981 . <unk> with his success as a solo artist in 1971 – 73 , the album continued Starr 's run of commercial and critical failures since 1976 ; Rodriguez writes that " [ m ] <unk> people either love or hate the <unk> " of " Back Off <unk> " . 
 Starr has performed " Back Off <unk> " in concert with his All @-@ Starr Band , beginning with the band 's debut tour of North America in July – September 1989 . The song was dropped from the concert setlist early in that tour , however , in favour of the 1963 Lennon – McCartney composition " I Wanna Be Your Man " . Live versions of " Back Off <unk> " have appeared on the multi @-@ disc compilation The Anthology ... So Far ( 2001 ) and King <unk> Flower Hour Presents <unk> & His New All @-@ Starr Band ( 2002 ) . The latter version was recorded during a US tour in August 2001 , at which point the All @-@ Starr line @-@ up was Starr ( vocals ) , Mark Rivera ( saxophone ) , Ian Hunter ( guitar ) , Roger Hodgson and Howard Jones ( keyboards ) , Greg Lake ( bass ) and <unk> E. ( drums ) . 
 Starr also played the song live with <unk> and the <unk> , a band he formed to promote his 1998 studio album <unk> Man . A version recorded on 13 May that year at Sony Music Studios , New York , appeared on Starr 's VH1 <unk> live album and video , released in October 1998 . The personnel on this performance included Starr ( vocals ) , Joe Walsh and Mark Hudson ( guitars ) , Jack <unk> ( bass ) and Simon <unk> ( drums ) . Another live version with the <unk> , recorded for PBS Television 's <unk> in August 2005 , was issued on <unk> Starr : Live at <unk> ( 2007 ) . 
 " Where the Streets Have No Name " is a song by Irish rock band U2 . It is the opening track from their 1987 album The Joshua Tree and was released as the album 's third single in August 1987 . The song 's hook is a repeating guitar <unk> using a delay effect , played during the song 's introduction and again at the end . Lead vocalist Bono wrote the lyrics in response to the notion that it is possible to identify a person 's religion and income based on the street on which they lived , particularly in Belfast . During the band 's difficulties recording the song , producer Brian Eno considered <unk> the song 's tapes to have them start from scratch . 
 " Where the Streets Have No Name " was praised by critics and became a commercial success , peaking at number thirteen in the US , number fourteen in Canada , number ten in the Netherlands , and number four in the United Kingdom . The song has remained a staple of their live act since the song debuted in 1987 on The Joshua Tree Tour . The song was performed on a Los Angeles <unk> for the filming of its music video , which won a Grammy Award for Best Performance Music Video . 
 The music for " Where the Streets Have No Name " originated from a demo that guitarist The Edge composed the night before the group resumed The Joshua Tree sessions . In an upstairs room at <unk> House — his newly purchased home — The Edge used a four @-@ track tape machine to record an arrangement of keyboards , bass , guitar , and a drum machine . <unk> that the album sessions were approaching the end and that the band were short on exceptional live songs , The Edge wanted to " <unk> up the ultimate U2 live @-@ song " , so he imagined what he would like to hear at a future U2 show if he were a fan . After finishing the rough mix , he felt he had come up with " the most amazing guitar part and song of [ his ] life " . With no one in the house to share the demo with , The Edge recalls dancing around and punching the air in celebration . 
 Although the band liked the demo , it was difficult for them to record the song . <unk> Adam Clayton said , " At the time it sounded like a foreign language , whereas now we understand how it works " . The arrangement , with two time signature shifts and frequent chord changes , was <unk> many times , but the group struggled to get a performance they liked . According to co @-@ producer Daniel Lanois , " that was the science project song . I remember having this massive schoolhouse <unk> , as we call them . I was holding a pointer , like a college professor , walking the band through the chord changes like a fucking <unk> . It was ridiculous . " Co @-@ producer Brian Eno estimates that half of the album sessions were spent trying to record a suitable version of " Where the Streets Have No Name " . The band worked on a single take for weeks , but as Eno explained , that particular version had a lot of problems with it and the group continued trying to fix it up . Through all of their work , they had gradually replaced each instrument take until nothing remained from the original performance . 
 So much time had been spent on " <unk> work " that Eno thought it would be best to start from scratch . His idea was to " stage an accident " and have the song 's tapes erased . He said that this was not to force abandonment of the song , but rather that it would be more effective to start again with a fresh performance . At one point , Eno had the tapes <unk> up and ready to be recorded over , but this <unk> never took place ; according to engineer Flood , fellow engineer Pat McCarthy returned to the control room and upon seeing Eno ready to erase the tapes , dropped the <unk> of tea he was carrying and physically restrained Eno . 
 The studio version of the song was compiled from several different takes . It was one of several songs mixed by Steve <unk> in the final months of recording The Joshua Tree . Drummer Larry Mullen , Jr. later said of the song , " It took so long to get that song right , it was difficult for us to make any sense of it . It only became a truly great song through playing live . On the record , musically , it 's not half the song it is live . " 
 " Where the Streets Have No Name " is played at a tempo of 126 beats per minute . The introduction and <unk> are played in a 3 / 4 time signature , while the remainder of the song is in a common 4 / 4 signature . The songs opens with an instrumental section , starting with <unk> @-@ like sustained <unk> notes . The guitar fades in after 42 seconds ; this part consists of a repeated " <unk> " six @-@ note <unk> . A " dotted eighth " delay effect is used to " play " each note in the <unk> twice , thus creating a rich sound . The bass and drums enter at 1 : 10 . 
 The introduction , following a I – IV – I – IV – vi – V – I chord progression , creates a " wall of sound " , as described by Mark Butler , against which the vocals emerge after nearly two minutes . The guitar part played for the remainder of the song features The Edge strumming <unk> sixteenth notes . The bass and drums continue in regular eighth and sixteenth notes , respectively , while Bono 's vocal performance , in contrast , varies greatly in its <unk> , ( " he <unk> ; he <unk> ; he <unk> ; he <unk> <unk> ; he allows his voice to crack " ) as well as timing by his usage of <unk> to slightly offset the notes he sings from the beat . 
 This development reaches a climax during the first chorus at the line " burning down love " ( A – G – F ♯ – D ) ; the melody progresses through a series of scale degrees that lead to the highest note in the song , the <unk> at " burning " . In later choruses , Bono sings " blown by the wind " with the same melody , stretching the same note even longer . After the third chorus , the song 's <unk> is played , the instrumentation reverting to the same state as it was in the introduction , with a six @-@ note guitar <unk> played against sustained <unk> notes . 
 The lyrics were inspired by a story that Bono heard about the streets of Belfast , Northern Ireland , where a person 's religion and income are evident by the street they live on . He contrasted this with the <unk> he felt when visiting Ethiopia , saying : " ... the guy in the song recognizes this contrast and thinks about a world where there aren 't such divisions , a place where the streets have no name . To me , that 's the way a great rock ' n ' roll concert should be : a place where everyone comes together ... Maybe that 's the dream of all art : to break down the barriers and the divisions between people and touch upon the things that matter the most to us all . " Bono wrote the lyrics while on a humanitarian visit to Ethiopia with his wife , Ali Hewson ; he first wrote them down on an <unk> bag while staying in a village . 
 According to him , the song is ostensibly about " <unk> , elevation , whatever you want to call it . " Bono , who compared many of his lyrics prior to The Joshua Tree to " sketches " , said that " ' Where the Streets Have No Name ' is more like the U2 of old than any of the other songs on the LP , because it 's a sketch — I was just trying to sketch a location , maybe a spiritual location , maybe a romantic location . I was trying to sketch a feeling . " 
 The open @-@ ended nature of the lyrics has led to many interpretations . Journalist Michael Campbell believed the lyrics send " a message of hope " and wish for a " world that is not divided by class , wealth , race , or any other arbitrary criterion " . With regard to the place Bono was referring to in the song , he said , " I 'm not sure , really , about that . I used to think it was Belfast ... " Journalist Niall Stokes believes the title was influenced by Bono 's and his wife Ali 's visit to Ethiopia as volunteer aid @-@ workers . Bono has expressed mixed opinions about the open @-@ ended lyrics : " I can look at it now and recognize that [ the song ] has one of the most <unk> couplets in the history of pop music . But it also contains some of the biggest ideas . In a curious way , that seems to work . If you get any way heavy about these things , you don 't communicate . But if you 're flip or <unk> about it , then you do . That 's one of the <unk> I 've come to terms with . " 
 Originally , the third single from The Joshua Tree was meant to be the song " Red Hill <unk> Town " , but " Where the Streets Have No Name " was released instead , in August 1987 . The single was released on 7 @-@ inch , 12 @-@ inch , cassette and CD single formats . Three B @-@ sides were featured on the single , including " Race Against Time " , " Silver and Gold " , and " <unk> Thing " , except for the 7 @-@ inch release , which only featured the latter two tracks . The 12 @-@ inch single featured " Race Against Time " on side A of the record ( despite being a " B @-@ side " ) , and the cassette single featured all four tracks on both sides of the tape . Although not as successful as the album 's first two singles , the song did chart well . In the U.S. , the song peaked at number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 11 on the Album Rock Tracks charts . The song reached number four on the UK Singles Chart , and it topped the Irish Singles Chart . 
 The video begins with an aerial shot of a block in Los Angeles , and clips of radio broadcasts are heard with disc <unk> stating that U2 is planning on performing a concert downtown and expecting crowds of 30 @,@ 000 people . Police show up to the set and inform the band 's crew of the security issue that the film shoot is causing , due to the large number of people who are coming to watch the performance . Two minutes into the video , U2 are seen on the roof of a liquor store at the corner of 7th <unk> and S. Main St. , and perform " Where the Streets Have No Name " to a large crowd of people standing in the streets surrounding the building . Towards the end of the song , the police tell the crew that the performance is about to be shut down , and eventually police walk onto the roof while the crowd are <unk> the police . 
 The video for " Where the Streets Have No Name " was directed by <unk> Avis and produced by Michael <unk> and Ben <unk> . The band attracted over 1 @,@ 000 people during the video 's filming , which took place on the <unk> of a liquor store in Downtown Los Angeles on 27 March 1987 . The band 's performance on a <unk> in a public place was a reference to The Beatles ' final concert , as depicted in the film Let It Be . 
 During the shoot U2 played an eight @-@ song set , which included four performances of " Where the Streets Have No Name " . Prior to filming , a week was spent reinforcing the roof of the liquor store to ensure it would not collapse if it were to be <unk> by a group of fans . A backup generator was put on the roof so the shooting could continue in the event that the authorities shut off the power on the primary generator , which happened during filming . 
 The depiction of the police attempting to shut down the video shoot due to safety concerns actually happened during filming , just as seen in the video . <unk> was almost arrested following a confrontation with the police . According to Avis , the events depicted in the video show what actually happened that day " almost in real time " , and that " getting <unk> was an integral part of the plan . " Band manager Paul McGuinness revealed in 2007 that much of the confrontation with the police was exaggerated ; the group were hoping to get shut down by the authorities in order to <unk> the music video , but the police continually gave them extensions for shooting the video . In the background of the video is a sign for The Million Dollar Hotel , which was rebuilt to create some interest , in case no one showed up at the film shoot . Although the video is of a live performance , the audio used is from the studio @-@ recorded version of the song . The video won the Grammy Award for Best Performance Music Video at the 1989 Grammy Awards . 
 " Race Against Time " was released on the 12 @-@ inch , cassette , and CD versions of the single . The song developed from the band 's interest in urban funk , and was described by The Edge as " a kind of Afro @-@ rhythmic piece " and " a study in rhythm . " The bass riff in the song , inspired by the <unk> , was played by The Edge , but stemmed from some of Clayton 's unused bass parts . Mullen 's drum part was recorded in a single take . The song is primarily an instrumental piece but does contain some lyrics inspired by Bono 's trip to Ethiopia after Live Aid and his witnessing firsthand the famine in occurrence ; these lyrical references include Bono singing in an Ethiopian language and following it with the phrase " Race against time " . Bono said of the song , " It reminds me of the desert . The desert is so empty , but it <unk> with a strange kind of <unk> . " John Hutchinson of Musician magazine described the song as having an " African flavour " and as being reminiscent of Peter Gabriel . The track was used in the Miami Vice episode " Child 's Play " , and is the only one of the single 's B @-@ sides that was never played live . 
 " Silver and Gold " was written in support of the Artists United Against <unk> project , which protested the South African apartheid . In 1985 , Bono participated in Steven Van <unk> 's anti @-@ apartheid Sun City project and spent time with Keith Richards and Mick Jagger of The Rolling Stones . When Richards and Jagger played blues , Bono was embarrassed by his lack of familiarity with the genre , as most of U2 's musical knowledge began with punk rock in their youth in the mid @-@ 1970s . Bono realised that U2 " had no tradition " , and he felt as if they " were from outer space " . This inspired him to write the blues @-@ influenced song " Silver and Gold " , which he recorded with Richards and Ronnie Wood . It was re @-@ recorded by U2 for the " Where the Streets Have No Name " single while the band returned to Dublin during in May 1987 during a break between the first and second legs of The Joshua Tree Tour . The song was described by Musician as " tough and raw , with Bono in <unk> and confident voice , <unk> by a <unk> bass line , and with The Edge demonstrating his newfound prowess in blues @-@ based guitar . " " Silver and Gold " was played live on The Joshua Tree Tour several times , one performance of which was featured on the band 's 1988 album and <unk> , Rattle and Hum . Both the studio recording and the Sun City versions were later featured on the bonus disc of the 20th anniversary edition of The Joshua Tree . The studio version was also included on the limited edition B @-@ sides bonus disk of the band 's first compilation album , The Best of 1980 – 1990 . 
 " <unk> Thing " was written by Bono as an apology to his wife for forgetting her birthday . The song opens with a short piano piece before the rest of the band begins to play . Some of Bono 's lyrics have been described as reminiscent of John Lennon . The Edge described it as " a beautiful song ... which is pop as it should be — not produced out of existence , but pop produced with a real intimacy and purity " , also noting that " It 's very new for us . " It was re @-@ recorded with some lyrical alterations and released in 1998 as a single in its own right for The Best of 1980 – 1990 . Hot Press editor Niall Stokes stated that this track , along with " Race Against Time " , is " an indicator of what U2 might have made instead of The Joshua Tree . " 
 Upon the release of The Joshua Tree , critics praised " Where the Streets Have No Name " . Steve <unk> of The Boston Globe noted the " bell @-@ like tones from the Edge <unk> [ e ] a search for heaven " and along with the subsequent track on the album , " I Still Haven 't Found What I 'm Looking For " , these songs showed how the group were " pilgrims still on a quest ; not preachers who claim to have found answers " . The Bergen Record echoed these sentiments , saying the tracks demonstrated how the band was on a personal and spiritual quest . Rolling Stone called it " assertive rock " in their review of The Joshua Tree . The San Diego Union @-@ Tribune said of " Where the Streets Have No Name " , " the music charges , like someone fleeing for life " . The Washington Post said the track is " a bit oblique lyrically , but the implications are clear in Bono 's resolute delivery , Dave ( the Edge ) Evan 's <unk> guitar , Adam Clayton 's cathedral bass and Larry Mullen 's rolling thunder drums " . 
 " Where the Streets Have No Name " made its concert debut on 2 April 1987 in <unk> , Arizona on the opening night of The Joshua Tree Tour . It has since been played at nearly every full @-@ length concert that U2 has <unk> , totaling over 700 performances as of 2011 . The song is widely regarded as one of the group 's most popular live songs . Bono said of it , " We can be in the middle of the worst gig in our lives , but when we go into that song , everything changes . The audience is on its feet , singing along with every word . It 's like God suddenly walks through the room . " 
 On The Joshua Tree Tour , " Where the Streets Have No Name " was most often used to open concerts . Fans and critics responded favourably to the song in a live setting . The San Diego Union @-@ Tribune wrote that , " From the <unk> sonic opening strains of [ the song ] , this audience was up , <unk> and <unk> . " NME wrote that the song is one such occasion where " the power afforded their songs is scary " , noting that during the song 's opening , " the arena <unk> " . In other reviews , the song was called : " <unk> " , " <unk> " , and " powerful " . Out of the 109 shows during The Joshua Tree Tour , " Streets " was played at all except 12 of the concerts . During the <unk> Tour which took place in 1989 and the beginning of 1990 , " Streets " was only left out of the set list at one of the 47 concerts . 
 The song was performed at every show on the 1992 – 1993 Zoo TV Tour . Concerts from this tour were elaborate <unk> <unk> that Bono performed as a variety of characters , but for the end of the main set , the group reverted to playing classics , including " Where the Streets Have No Name " , straight . Some of these performances of the song were accompanied by footage of the group in the desert from The Joshua Tree 's photo shoot . The video was <unk> up for humorous effect — NME described the effect as giving it a " silly , Charlie <unk> quality " — and Bono often acknowledged his younger self on the video screens . This video would make a return during performances on the 2010 and 2011 legs of the U2 360 ° Tour . Some of the Zoo TV performances of the song had a more electronic dance music arrangement that bore a resemblance to the Pet Shop Boys ' synthpop cover of the song ( titled " Where the Streets Have No Name ( I Can 't Take My Eyes off You ) " ) . Bono parodied this by occasionally adopting the deadpan vocal style used in the Pet Shop Boys ' cover . Critics welcomed the song in the group 's setlist : The Independent said the song " <unk> instant euphoria , as U2 do what they 're best at , slipping into epic rock mode , playing music made for the arena " . In two other local newspaper reviews , critics praised the song 's inclusion in a sequence of greatest hits . 
 For the PopMart Tour of 1997 – 1998 , U2 returned to the electronic dance arrangement they occasionally played on the Zoo TV Tour . The set 's massive video screen displayed a video that Hot Press described as an " astonishing , 2001 @-@ style trip into the heart of a <unk> , psychedelic tunnel that sucks the audience in towards a horizontal <unk> " . Near the end of the song , peace <unk> were shown on the screen and bright beams of light flanking the set 's golden arch were projected upwards . Hot Press said the effect transformed the stadium into a " UFO landing site " . 
 Shortly before the third leg of the <unk> Tour , the September 11 attacks occurred in New York City and Washington D.C. During the band 's first show in New York City following the attacks , the band performed " Where the Streets Have No Name " , and when the stage lights illuminated the audience , the band saw tears streaming down the faces of many fans . The experience was one inspiration for the song " City of <unk> Lights " . The band paid tribute to the 9 / 11 victims during their performance of the song at the Super Bowl <unk> halftime show on 3 February 2002 . The performance featured the names of the September 11 victims projected onto a large white banner behind the band . U2 's appearance was later ranked number 1 on Sports Illustrated 's list of " Top 10 Super Bowl <unk> <unk> " . 
 For the Vertigo Tour , the group originally considered dropping the song from their <unk> , but Mullen and Clayton successfully argued against this . All 131 of the Vertigo Tour concerts featured a performance of the song , which were accompanied by the stage 's LED video <unk> displaying African flags . On the tour 's opening night , this reminded Bono that he had originally written the lyrics in an Ethiopian village . He thought this visual accompaniment made the song come full circle , saying , " And here it was , nearly twenty years later , coming back to Africa , all the stuff about <unk> lands and <unk> making sense for the first time . " The song was also played at the preview screening of the band 's concert film U2 3D at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival . At the Glastonbury Festival 2010 , The Edge accompanied rock band <unk> for a live cover version of the track , later playing it with U2 while headlining Glastonbury in 2011 . 
 Live performances of " Where the Streets Have No Name " appear in the concert video releases Rattle and Hum , Zoo TV : Live from Sydney , and PopMart : Live from Mexico City , as well as the respective audio releases of the latter two concerts , Zoo TV Live and Hasta la Vista Baby ! U2 Live from Mexico City . A second version from the PopMart Tour was featured on Please : <unk> Live EP , and later on the U.S. " Please " single . A live recording from Boston during the <unk> Tour was featured in the concert film <unk> 2001 : Live from Boston , and on the " Walk On " and " Electrical Storm " singles . The concert video and album U2 Go Home : Live from <unk> Castle , Ireland featured another performance from the <unk> Tour , and later performances were featured in the concert films Vertigo 2005 : Live from Chicago and U2 3D ( Vertigo Tour ) , and U2 360 ° at the Rose Bowl ( U2 360 ° Tour ) . The 2004 digital album , Live from the Point Depot , contains a performance from the <unk> Tour , only available as part of The Complete U2 digital box set . 
 The <unk> <unk> reaction ( often referred to as simply the <unk> <unk> ) is a chemical reaction used in organic chemistry for the synthesis of <unk> . The reaction is typically divided into classical and modern variants , depending on the reagents and substrates employed . It was originally discovered by Ivan <unk> <unk> ( 1906 – 1957 ) in 1941 while studying the <unk> of <unk> vinyl <unk> . 
 The success of the <unk> <unk> as a tool in organic synthesis stems from the utility and <unk> of <unk> as both motifs in natural products ( including <unk> , the <unk> , and a <unk> of <unk> ) and as useful synthetic <unk> for total synthesis . The reaction has been used in several total syntheses and several reviews have been published . 
 Along this same vein , <unk> vinyl <unk> of the type studied extensively by Marcus <unk> of the University of Hawaii show dramatic rate acceleration due to the removal of β @-@ <unk> , <unk> a large amount of <unk> strain in the s @-@ <unk> <unk> . 
 Research involving the reaction was relatively quiet in subsequent years , until in the mid @-@ 1980s when several syntheses employing the <unk> <unk> were published . <unk> below are key steps in the syntheses of <unk> and Nor @-@ <unk> , the latter of which is thought to proceed via an unusual <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> that generates the <unk> <unk> . 
 The classical version of the <unk> <unk> suffers from several drawbacks which modern variants attempt to <unk> . The first two are not evident from the mechanism alone , but are indicative of the barriers to <unk> ; the last three stem from selectivity issues relating to elimination and <unk> of the intermediate . 
 Strong Lewis or <unk> acids are typically required for the reaction ( e.g. <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ) . These <unk> are not compatible with sensitive functional groups , limiting the substrate scope . 
 Despite the <unk> possibility for catalysis , multiple equivalents of the promoter are often required in order to effect the reaction . This limits the atom economy of the reaction . 
 The elimination step is not <unk> ; if multiple β @-@ <unk> are available for elimination , various products are often observed as mixtures . This is highly undesirable from an efficiency standpoint as <unk> separation is typically required . 
 <unk> of the <unk> is sometimes not <unk> , meaning that products can be formed as mixtures of <unk> . 
 The shortcomings noted above limit the usefulness of the <unk> <unk> reaction in its canonical form . However , modifications to the reaction focused on <unk> its issues continue to be an active area of academic research . In particular , the research has focused on a few key areas : rendering the reaction catalytic in the promoter , <unk> the reaction with more mild <unk> to improve functional group tolerance , directing the <unk> of the elimination step , and improving the overall <unk> . These have been successful to varying degrees . 
 Additionally , modifications focused on altering the progress of the reaction , either by generating the <unk> cation in an unorthodox fashion or by having the <unk> cation " intercepted " in various ways . Furthermore , enantioselective variants of various kinds have been developed . The sheer volume of literature on the subject prevents a comprehensive examination of this field ; key examples are given below . 
 The earliest efforts to improve the selectivity of the <unk> <unk> took advantage of the β @-@ silicon effect in order to direct the <unk> of the elimination step . This chemistry was developed most extensively by Professor Scott Denmark of the University of Illinois , <unk> @-@ <unk> in the mid @-@ 1980s and utilizes stoichiometric amounts of iron <unk> to promote the reaction . With <unk> products , the <unk> <unk> was selected for to varying degrees . 
 The silicon @-@ directed <unk> <unk> reaction was subsequently employed in the synthesis of the natural product <unk> , shown below . The <unk> takes place before elimination of the <unk> alcohol <unk> , so that the resulting <unk> of the newly formed ring arises from approach of the <unk> <unk> anti to the <unk> . 
 It is often possible to achieve catalytic activation using a <unk> or withdrawing group alone , although the efficiency of the reaction ( yield , reaction time , etc . ) is typically lower . 
 In the total synthesis of <unk> , <unk> of a vinyl <unk> <unk> likewise generates a <unk> cation via ring opening of the resultant <unk> . 
 <unk> @-@ directed <unk> <unk> can exhibit induced diastereoselectivity in this way . In the example below , the <unk> @-@ group acts to direct the <unk> by preventing the distant <unk> from rotating " towards " it via unfavorable <unk> interaction . In this way the silicon acts as a <unk> auxiliary . ( The starting material is not <unk> but the retention of enantiomeric excess suggests that the auxiliary directs the <unk> . ) 
 <unk> 's <unk> substrates can exhibit axial to <unk> <unk> transfer if <unk> <unk> are used . The example below generates a <unk> <unk> in 64 % yield and 95 % enantiomeric excess . 
 <unk> has additionally developed a camphor @-@ based auxiliary for <unk> <unk> that was employed in the first asymmetric synthesis of <unk> . The key step employs an unusual mixture of <unk> @-@ 2 @-@ <unk> and <unk> as solvent . 
 The first <unk> Lewis acid promoted asymmetric <unk> <unk> was reported by <unk> Aggarwal and utilized copper ( II ) <unk> ligand complexes with up to 98 % ee . The enantiomeric excess was unaffected by use of 50 <unk> % of the copper complex but the yield was significantly decreased . 
 <unk> <unk> is a 2011 American black comedy film directed by Seth Gordon , written by Michael <unk> , John Francis <unk> and Jonathan Goldstein , based on a story by <unk> . It stars Jason Bateman , Charlie Day , Jason Sudeikis , Jennifer Aniston , Colin Farrell , Kevin Spacey , and Jamie <unk> . The plot follows three friends , played by Bateman , Day , and Sudeikis , who decide to murder their respective overbearing , abusive bosses , portrayed by Spacey , Aniston and Farrell . 
 <unk> 's script was bought by New Line Cinema in 2005 and the film spent six years in various states of pre @-@ production , with a variety of actors attached to different roles . By 2010 , Goldstein and <unk> had rewritten the script , and the film finally went into production . 
 The film premiered in Los Angeles on June 30 , 2011 , and received a wide release on July 8 , 2011 . The film exceeded financial expectations , <unk> over $ 28 million in the first three days , making it the number two film in the United States during its opening weekend , and going on to become the highest @-@ grossing black comedy film of all time in <unk> dollars , breaking the record previously set by The War of the Roses in 1990 . The film grossed over $ <unk> million worldwide during its theatrical run . 
 The film opened to positive critical reception , with several critics praising the ensemble cast , with each lead being singled out for their performances across reviews . The plot received a more mixed response ; some reviewers felt that its dark , humorous premise was explored well , while others felt the jokes were racist , <unk> , and <unk> . A sequel , <unk> <unk> 2 , was released on November 26 , 2014 . 
 Nick <unk> ( Bateman ) and Dale <unk> ( Day ) are friends who <unk> their bosses . Nick works at a financial firm for the sadistic David <unk> ( Spacey ) , who implies the possibility of a promotion for Nick for months , only to award it to himself . Dale is a <unk> assistant being sexually harassed by his boss , Dr. Julia Harris ( Aniston ) ; she threatens to tell his <unk> Stacy ( Lindsay <unk> ) that he had sex with her unless he actually has sex with her . Nick and Dale 's <unk> friend Kurt <unk> ( Sudeikis ) enjoys working for Jack <unk> ( Donald Sutherland ) at a chemical company , but after Jack unexpectedly dies of a heart attack , the company is taken over by Jack 's cocaine @-@ addicted son Bobby ( Farrell ) , whose apathy and incompetence threaten the future of the company . 
 At night , over drinks , Kurt <unk> suggests that their lives would be <unk> if their bosses were no longer around . Initially hesitant , they eventually agree to kill their employers . In search of a <unk> , the trio meet Dean " <unk> " Jones ( <unk> ) , an ex @-@ con who agrees to be their " murder consultant " . Jones suggests that Dale , Kurt and Nick kill each other 's bosses to hide their motive while making the deaths look like accidents . 
 The police arrest Nick , Dale and Kurt , but the navigation @-@ system operator , Gregory , reveals that it is his companies policy to record all conversations for quality assurance . Gregory plays the tape that has <unk> <unk> he murdered <unk> . <unk> is sentenced to 25 years to life in prison , while the friends get their charges waived . Nick is promoted to president of the company under a sadistic CEO , Kurt retains his job under a new boss , and Dale blackmails Julia into ending her harassment by convincing her to sexually harass a supposedly unconscious patient , while Jones secretly records the act . 
 An executive at a financial firm who is manipulated into jumping through <unk> in order to get a promotion that his boss never intended to give him . <unk> wrote the role specifically for Bateman . 
 A <unk> assistant who is sexually harassed by his boss . Described as a " <unk> romantic " in love with his fiancée . Ashton <unk> was in talks for the role at two different points in the lengthy production . Day was considered for the role following his co @-@ starring performance with Sudeikis in the 2010 film Going the <unk> — Reuters reported that industry <unk> believed his performance overshadowed the main stars . 
 An account manager at a chemical company dealing with a new , drug @-@ addicted boss after his beloved former boss dies . Sudeikis was cast in May 2010 . 
 <unk> based the character on a former boss , claiming she was " very sexually aggressive with everybody " . When writing the script , <unk> intended for the role to go to Aniston . He stated , " but [ the aforementioned boss ] looked more like <unk> de <unk> . It was like flirting with a <unk> . So I decided for the sake of the movie , let ’ s go with Jennifer Aniston . ” The actress insisted on wearing a brown wig for the role , wanting to look different from other characters she had played . 
 Described as a " <unk> <unk> " and a " corrupt and incompetent <unk> who 's in charge of things but clearly has no idea what he 's doing . " Farrell explained the motivation he gave to the character , stating " This guy thinks he 's God 's gift to women , God 's gift to <unk> , to humor , to the club scene , to everything . It 's all part of his grandiose sense of self @-@ esteem , which is probably <unk> a deeper sense of being a disappointment to his father and being riddled with envy over the relationship his father had with Kurt , and all kinds of other things . With <unk> , Seth gave me complete license to act as <unk> <unk> up as possible . " Farrell contributed significantly to the appearance of his character , suggesting the comb over hairstyle , pot @-@ belly and an affinity for Chinese <unk> . 
 President of <unk> Industries . Tom Cruise , Philip Seymour Hoffman and Jeff Bridges had been approached by New Line Cinema to take the role , described as a <unk> master <unk> with an attractive wife . Spacey signed up for the role in June 2010 . The part was considered " integral " to the film . Gordon commented that the character was an amalgamation of several real bosses ( rather than one single person ) to avoid being sued . 
 The character had the more " colorful " name " <unk> Jones " , but it was changed at <unk> 's request , with producer Jay Stern commenting that <unk> felt it " was over the line " . The current name was said to be subject to further change , prior to the release of the film . <unk> contributed to his character 's appearance , suggesting full @-@ <unk> tattoos and a retro clothing style . <unk> described the appearance as " a guy who maybe went to jail for a minute and now he 's living in his own time capsule . When he got out he went right back to the clothes he thought were hot when he went in . " 
 During the six @-@ year development of the film , several actors were in negotiations to star , including Owen Wilson , Vince <unk> , Matthew <unk> , Ryan Reynolds , Dax Shepard , and Johnny <unk> . 
 <unk> 's script for <unk> <unk> was sold at auction to New Line Cinema by <unk> 's production company Rat Entertainment in 2005 for a six @-@ figure amount . <unk> initially was interested in directing , but became occupied with directing the comedy Tower <unk> . Frank <unk> and David <unk> were in talks to direct . Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis <unk> rewrote the script in 2010 , and the project went into production with Seth Gordon directing . 
 Production designer Shepherd <unk> specifically set out to create distinctly different environments for the three employees and their respective bosses ' homes and offices . Nick and <unk> 's workplace is the " <unk> " bullpen , which was designed to " enhance the discomfort and anxiety of lower @-@ level employees clustered in the center of the room where every movement is monitored by the boss from his corner office . " The design team met with financial <unk> and management companies to learn about the architecture of their office layouts to visually represent the experience of starting from a low @-@ ranking position in a <unk> and aspiring to an office . Costume designer Carol Ramsey worked with <unk> and set <unk> Jan <unk> to match <unk> 's suit to that of the surrounding " cold grey and blue " color palette of his office . <unk> 's home was described as " equally lacking in warmth " as the office but more lavishly decorated and " for show " , including an intentionally oversized portrait of him with his " trophy wife " . 
 <unk> Julia 's office was described as a " challenge " , <unk> a " sensual vibe " into a <unk> office . <unk> approached the design through Julia 's mentality , stating , " She 's a Type A professional at the top of her game , who likes to play cat @-@ and @-@ mouse , so it 's a completely controlled environment , with <unk> and views into other rooms so she always knows what 's going on " . " It 's highly designed , with rich <unk> and tones , <unk> artwork and subtle lighting — all very <unk> till you step into her private office . The <unk> close , the door locks and you think , ' It 's the Temple of Doom . ' " Similarly approaching the character 's home , the design allowed for wide windows which face onto a public street " which afford her the opportunity to put on the kind of show she couldn 't get away with at work . " 
 Filming of <unk> <unk> took place in and around Los Angeles . The production team attempted to find locations " that people haven 't already seen a hundred times in movies and on TV " , aiming for the film to appear as if it could be taking place anywhere in America " where people are trying to pursue the American dream but getting stopped by a horrible boss . " " <unk> " was represented by an office building in <unk> , California , with the crew building the set on a vacant floor . For " <unk> Chemical " , the production team found a " perfect landscape of pipes and containers " in Santa Fe Springs , surrounding an unoccupied water cleaning and storage facility . To take advantage of the surrounding imagery , the warehouse required an extensive series of <unk> , including cutting windows into concrete walls and creating new <unk> to allow for visuals of the warehouse exterior and provide a setting for the final scene of Sutherland 's character . A <unk> Friday 's in Woodland Hills , Los Angeles , was used as a bar frequented by Nick , Dale , and Kurt , while the bar scene where they meet with Jones was staged in downtown Los Angeles . 
 The film was shot digitally using the <unk> Genesis camera . Gordon encouraged the actors to improvise , though Aniston claimed to not have taken advantage of the offer as much as her co @-@ stars , stating , " My dialogue was just so beautifully choreographed that there wasn ’ t much that I needed to do ” . 
 <unk> <unk> : The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was released in physical and digital formats on July 5 , 2011 , by <unk> Music . The soundtrack consists of 33 tracks with a <unk> of 63 minutes . 
 The world premiere of <unk> <unk> took place on June 30 , 2011 at <unk> 's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood , California .

The site 's critical consensus reads , " It 's nasty , uneven , and far from original , but thanks to a <unk> assembled cast that makes the most of a solid premise , <unk> <unk> works . " Review aggregate Metacritic gave the film a score of 57 out of 100 , based on 40 critics , indicating " mixed or average reviews " . 
 The film received several award nominations , including a <unk> Award for Best Supporting Actor for Colin Farrell , and three nominations from the 2012 Comedy Awards , including Comedy Actor for Bateman , Comedy Actress for Aniston , and best Comedy Film . Farrell and Aniston were both nominated for Best On @-@ Screen Dirt <unk> at the 2012 MTV Movie Awards , with Aniston claiming the award . Farrell also received a nomination for Best On @-@ Screen <unk> .

 Seth Gordon confirmed in July 2011 that talks were underway for a sequel , after the financial success of the film in the United States , saying : " Yeah , we 've definitely discussed it . It 's done well in the States , the film has , so that 's becoming a more <unk> effort now , we 're trying to figure out what the sequel could be . " On January 4 , 2012 , it was confirmed that a sequel was moving forward , and that Goldstein and <unk> would be returning to write the script . New Line was reported to be negotiating with Gordon to return as director , with Bateman , Day , and Sudeikis also expected to return to their roles . On February 27 , 2012 , it was confirmed that Goldstein and <unk> were in the process of writing the new script . In March 2013 , Goldstein and <unk> confirmed that they had submitted multiple draft scripts for the sequel , and that production had moved towards <unk> the budget . Later in the same month Bateman , Day , and Sudeikis were confirmed to be reprising their roles , with <unk> negotiating to return . The film will again be produced by Brett <unk> and Jay Stern . In August 2013 , it was announced that Gordon would not be returning to direct because of scheduling conflicts and that the studio was actively searching for a replacement . In September 2013 , Sean Anders was announced as Gordon 's replacement , with John Morris joining the production as a producer . The pair had previously performed a rewrite on Goldstein 's and <unk> 's sequel script . Filming had been scheduled to begin in summer 2013 , but began in November 2013 . <unk> , Jennifer Aniston , and Kevin Spacey reprised their roles , with Christoph <unk> and Chris Pine joining the cast . 
 Ma Anand <unk> and three other <unk> followers traveled to New York in the spring of 1985 to acquire false identification . According to a federal <unk> , the <unk> of the assassination plot used a false birth certificate to purchase guns . Two members of the group then traveled to Texas to purchase <unk> . Caldwell stated she and Catherine Jane <unk> flew to Texas to purchase guns there . They purchased five guns in Texas , but encountered difficulty purchasing <unk> in Texas with out @-@ of @-@ state identification and traveled to New Mexico instead . Caldwell said they called back to the commune but the women were instructed " not to come back without the guns " . 
 After obtaining guns the conspirators returned to Portland , Oregon . They rented out an apartment in Portland to serve as their base of operations for the assassination of Turner . <unk> follower Carol Matthews ( Ma <unk> <unk> ) used a fake name during the planning of the assassination plot , in an attempt to obtain the home address of Charles Turner . According to federal prosecutors Matthews obtained a college <unk> of Turner 's , and learned his car 's license plate number and his parking location . Court records state that Matthews and an <unk> co @-@ <unk> gave <unk> registration officials fake identities and told officials they were conducting " a <unk> survey on President Reagan 's economic plan " , in order to obtain Turner 's route number and post office box number . The two tried repeating the story with members of the U.S. Postal Service , but the postal officials did not give them Turner 's address . They then drove around Turner 's neighborhood and were able to find his home by locating a sign in front of his residence that said " Turner " . Matthews had pictures of Turner 's residence developed ; these were later obtained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) during an investigation of the <unk> commune , and verified after being shown to Turner . 
 Members of the group of conspirators watched Turner 's office , home and car , and discussed methods to assassinate him , hoping that his death would hinder the efforts of the federal investigation into <unk> . Their plan was to shoot Turner in the garage of the federal office building where he worked , in Portland , Oregon , but the conspirators also debated whether to murder Turner in downtown Portland or closer to his home . After spending multiple nights watching Turner 's house , the conspirators decided on the parking garage because they felt it would be too risky to murder him on the drive to or from work , or in front of his home . Turner had a reserved parking spot in a federal garage underneath Terry <unk> Plaza in Portland , Oregon . In an <unk> given to the FBI , <unk> Alma <unk> described how the <unk> decided on the federal parking garage as the location : " <unk> <unk> [ Catherine Jane <unk> ] said this seems like a good place to bump this fellow off . " 
 The conspirators practiced different ways of murdering Turner . According to informant statements to law enforcement , one of the conspirators was to pretend there was car trouble , and the others would then approach Turner with their guns . <unk> later told law enforcement officials that the conspirators intended to hide out at an international network of <unk> <unk> if the plan was successful . According to The <unk> the <unk> were not carried out because Ma Anand <unk> became distracted by political power plays within the <unk> commune and other members of the organization who were trying to remove her from her position within the group . 
 On February 28 , 1985 , Congressman James H. Weaver gave a speech in the United States House of Representatives in which he asserted that the <unk> were involved in the <unk> attack in Oregon . At a series of press conferences in September 1985 , <unk> accused several of his recently departed lieutenants of involvement in this and other crimes , including the poisoning of Mike Sullivan , a Jefferson County district attorney , and asked state and federal authorities to investigate his allegations . The assassination plot was uncovered by federal law enforcement as a result of the ensuing investigation into activities at <unk> . Turner was never physically <unk> , and had retired by 1995 . 
 Joseph Greene , a U.S. immigration agent , testified in court that FBI agents had learned of the assassination plot from a member of the organization who was in a witness protection program . Greene said that members involved in the assassination plot included Ma Anand <unk> , <unk> Yvonne <unk> , and Alma <unk> . The assassination plot was investigated by the FBI and the Oregon State Police . <unk> told law enforcement that Ma Anand <unk> hoped Turner 's death would prevent an Immigration and <unk> Service investigation which she thought could lead to <unk> 's arrest and <unk> from the United States . Weaver stated " These attempts to assassinate public officials were because they were presenting an immigration case that might result in imprisonment " of <unk> . " There were not simply plans , but at least one ( assassination ) attempt , " said Weaver at the hearing . 
 A grand jury investigation led by Turner brought charges of " widespread immigration fraud " against members of <unk> . <unk> crimes were discovered after Ma Anand <unk> had fled the commune in September 1985 . In December 1985 , 21 followers of <unk> were indicted on <unk> charges . 
 Ma Anand <unk> served 29 months in a minimum security federal prison for charges related to assault , attempted murder , <unk> , <unk> and the 1984 <unk> attack in The <unk> , and moved to Switzerland after her release from prison in 1988 . The assassination conspiracy was discovered after <unk> had left the United States , and as of 1999 she was still wanted by federal law enforcement for her role in the plot , and risked <unk> if she crossed the Swiss border . Switzerland declined an <unk> request from the United States , and instead tried her in a Swiss court . <unk> was found guilty of " criminal acts preparatory to the commission of murder " in 1999 , and sentenced to time already served . 
 In December 2002 , Ann <unk> McCarthy pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder , and was sentenced to one year in jail and a fine of USD $ 10 @,@ 000 . McCarthy had served as fourth @-@ in @-@ command of <unk> , and was known by <unk> 's followers as Ma <unk> <unk> . Turner called the one @-@ year prison sentence " <unk> . " In court statements , McCarthy stated " I cannot forgive myself for not being <unk> at the time , " and called her time with the group " psychological torture . " 
 In February 2006 , <unk> became the last perpetrator sentenced in the political assassination plot , after ten months of negotiations with Oregon prosecutors . <unk> offered to turn herself in and return to the United States after learning of her son 's terminal brain tumor . Prior to sentencing , the court allowed her to travel to Australia to visit her son . In addition to charges of conspiracy to commit murder , <unk> also pleaded guilty to the purchase of weapons in violation of federal firearms law . An Oregon judge sentenced her to five years <unk> , and three months time already served in a German jail . Turner thought she should have received a <unk> sentence , and commented " This was a lying @-@ in @-@ wait conspiracy to murder me , a presidential appointee , and for a long time I slept with a loaded gun beside my bed . " Though <unk> could have faced life in prison , U.S. District Judge Judge Malcolm F. Marsh thought she had " seen the error of her ways . " A federal prosecutor in the case described <unk> as the " MVP " of the conspiracy , and said she was the designated assassin that was set to murder Turner . After her sentencing , <unk> stated : " I actually conspired to kill Mr. Turner , it is up to me alone to face this terrible truth ... No person has the right to do what I did . I 'm truly sorry . " <unk> returned to Germany after her sentencing . 
 Die Another Day ( 2002 ) is the twentieth spy film in the James Bond series , and the fourth and final film to star Pierce <unk> as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond . The film follows Bond as he leads a mission to North Korea , during which he is betrayed and , after seemingly killing a rogue North Korean colonel , is captured and imprisoned . Fourteen months later , Bond is released as part of a prisoner exchange . <unk> that someone within the British government betrayed him , he attempts to earn redemption by tracking down his <unk> and killing a North Korean agent he believes was involved in his torture . 
 Die Another Day , produced by Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli , and directed by Lee <unk> , marked the James Bond franchise 's 40th anniversary . The series began in 1962 with Sean Connery starring as Bond in Dr. No . Die Another Day includes references to each of the preceding films . 
 The film received mixed reviews . Some critics praised the work of Lee <unk> , while others criticised the film 's heavy use of computer @-@ generated imagery , which they found <unk> and a distraction from the film 's plot . Nevertheless , Die Another Day was the highest @-@ grossing James Bond film up to that time if inflation is not taken into account . 
 MI6 officer James Bond — agent <unk> — infiltrates a North Korean military base , where Colonel Tan @-@ Sun Moon is illegally trading weapons for African blood <unk> . After Moon 's assistant <unk> discovers that Bond is a British agent , the colonel attempts to kill Bond and a <unk> chase <unk> , which ends with Moon 's apparent death . Bond survives , but is captured by North Korean soldiers and imprisoned by the Colonel 's father , General Moon . 
 After 14 months of captivity and torture , Bond is traded for <unk> in a prisoner exchange . He is <unk> and taken to meet M , who informs him that his status as a 00 Agent is suspended under suspicion of having leaked information under <unk> . Bond is convinced that he has been set up by a double agent in the British government and decides to avenge his betrayal . After escaping from the custody of MI6 , he discovers that he is in Hong Kong , where he learns from a Chinese agent that <unk> is in Cuba . 
 In Havana Bond meets <unk> agent <unk> ' Jinx ' Johnson and follows her to a gene therapy clinic , where patients can have their appearances altered through DNA restructuring . Bond locates <unk> inside the clinic and attempts to kill him , but <unk> escapes . He leaves behind a <unk> which leads Bond to a <unk> of <unk> , identified as conflict <unk> , but bearing the crest of the company owned by British billionaire Gustav Graves . 
 At <unk> Club in London Bond meets Graves , along with his assistant Miranda Frost , who is also an undercover MI6 agent . After a fencing exercise ( and a literal sword @-@ fight ) , Bond is invited by Graves to Iceland for a scientific demonstration . Shortly afterwards , M <unk> Bond 's Double @-@ 0 status and offers assistance in the investigation . 
 At his ice palace in Iceland Graves <unk> a new orbital mirror satellite , " Icarus " , which is able to focus solar energy on a small area and provide year @-@ round sunshine for crop development . During the night , Jinx infiltrates Graves ' command centre , but is captured by Graves and <unk> . Bond rescues her and later discovers that Colonel Moon is still alive . Moon has used the gene therapy technology to change his appearance , assuming the identity of Gustav Graves . 
 Bond confronts Graves , but Frost arrives to reveal herself as the traitor who betrayed Bond in North Korea , forcing <unk> to escape from Graves ' facility . Bond then returns in his Aston Martin <unk> to rescue Jinx , who has been captured once again . <unk> pursues him in his own vehicle , both cars driving inside the rapidly melting ice palace . Bond kills <unk> by shooting an ice <unk> onto him , and then <unk> Jinx after she has drowned . 
 Bond and Jinx pursue Graves and Frost to the Korean peninsula and <unk> away on Graves ' cargo plane . Graves reveals his true identity to his father , and the purpose of the Icarus satellite : to cut a path through the Korean <unk> Zone with concentrated sunlight , allowing North Korean troops to invade South Korea and reunite the peninsula by force . <unk> , General Moon tries to stop the plan , but he is murdered by his own son . 
 Bond attempts to shoot Graves but he is prevented by one of the soldiers on board . In their struggle , a gunshot <unk> the fuselage , causing the plane to descend rapidly . Bond engages Graves in a fist fight , and Jinx attempts to regain control of the plane . Frost attacks Jinx , forcing her to defend herself in a sword duel . After the plane passes through the Icarus beam and is further damaged , Jinx kills Frost . Graves attempts to escape by parachute , but Bond opens the parachute , causing Graves to be pulled out of the plane and into one of its engines , killing him and <unk> the Icarus beam . Bond and Jinx then escape from the disintegrating plane in a helicopter from the cargo hold , carrying away Graves ' <unk> of <unk> in the process .

 The scenes featuring Berry in a bikini were shot in <unk> . The location was reportedly cold and <unk> , and footage has been released of Berry wrapped in thick <unk> between takes to avoid catching a <unk> . Berry was injured during filming when debris from a smoke grenade flew into her eye . The debris was removed in a 30 @-@ minute operation . 
 The soundtrack was composed by David Arnold and released on Warner Bros. Records . He again made use of electronic rhythm elements in his score , and included two of the new themes created for The World Is Not Enough . The first , originally used as <unk> 's theme , is heard during the <unk> " <unk> " cue on the recording , and is written for piano . The second new theme , used in the " Christmas in Turkey " track of The World Is Not Enough , is reused in the " Going Down Together " track . 
 The title song for Die Another Day was co @-@ written and co @-@ produced by <unk> <unk> and performed by Madonna , who also had a cameo in the film as <unk> , a fencing instructor . This is the first Bond title sequence to directly reflect the film 's plot since Dr. No ; all the other previous Bond titles are stand @-@ alone set pieces . The concept of the title sequence is to represent Bond trying to survive 14 months of torture at the hands of the North Koreans . Critics ' opinions of the song were sharply divided — it was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Original Song and the 2004 Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording , but also for a Golden <unk> Award for <unk> Original Song of 2002 ( while Madonna herself won the Golden <unk> Award for <unk> Supporting Actress for her cameo ) . In a <unk> poll for the Channel 4 programme " James Bond 's Greatest Hits " , the song was voted 9th out of 22 , and also came in as an " overwhelming number one " favourite among those under the age of 24 . 
 MGM and <unk> Productions granted Mattel the license to sell a line of Barbie dolls based around the franchise . Mattel announced that the Bond <unk> will be at her " stylish best " , clad in evening dress and red <unk> . <unk> <unk> created the dress , which is <unk> to the thigh to reveal a telephone <unk> to Barbie 's leg . The doll was sold in a gift set , with Barbie 's boyfriend Ken posing as Bond in a <unk> designed by the Italian fashion house <unk> . 
 <unk> also collaborated with the makers of Die Another Day to create a cosmetics line based around the character Jinx . The limited edition <unk> Colour Collection was launched on 7 November 2002 to coincide with the film 's release . The product names were loaded with puns and <unk> , with shades and textures ranging from the " warm " to " cool and <unk> " . 
 Die Another Day had its world premiere on 18 November 2002 at the Royal Albert Hall in London . Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip were guests of honour , making it the second Bond film premiere to be attended by the Queen , the first one being You Only Live Twice in 1967 . The Royal Albert Hall had a make @-@ over for the screening and had been transformed into an ice palace . <unk> from the <unk> , about £ 500 @,@ 000 , were donated to the Cinema and Television <unk> Fund of which the Queen is patron . On the first day , ticket sales reached £ 1 @.@ 2 million . Die Another Day was the highest grossing James Bond film until the release of Casino <unk> . It earned $ 432 million worldwide , becoming the sixth highest grossing film of 2002 . 
 Die Another Day became a controversial subject in eastern Asia . The North Korean government disliked the portrayal of their state as brutal and war @-@ hungry . The South Koreans boycotted 145 theatres where it was released on 31 December 2002 , as they were offended by the scene in which an American officer issues orders to the South Korean army in the defence of their homeland , and by a <unk> scene near a statue of the Buddha . The <unk> Buddhist Order issued a statement that the film was " <unk> to our religion and does not reflect our values and ethics " . The Washington Post reported growing resentment in the nation towards the United States . An official of the South Korean Ministry of Culture and Tourism said that Die Another Day was " the wrong film at the wrong time . " 
 The amount of product placement in the film was a point of criticism , specifically from various news outlets such as the BBC , Time and Reuters who all used the pun " Buy Another Day " . Reportedly 20 companies , paying $ 70 million , had their products featured in the film , a record at the time , although USA Today reported that number to be as high as $ 100 million . By choice , the number of companies involved in product placement was dropped to eight for the next Bond film Casino <unk> in 2006 . 
 However , Die Another Day was strongly criticised by some reviewers who felt that the film relied too heavily on <unk> and special effects , with the plot being neglected . James <unk> of <unk> said , " This is a train wreck of an action film – a <unk> attempt by the filmmakers to force @-@ feed James Bond into the mindless <unk> mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud <unk> . " Of the action sequences , he said , " Die Another Day is an exercise in loud explosions and <unk> bad special effects . The CGI work in this movie is an order of magnitude worse than anything I have seen in a major motion picture . Coupled with <unk> production design , Die Another Day looks like it was done on the cheap . Gary Brown of the Houston Community Newspapers also described the weak point of the film as " the seemingly non @-@ stop action sequences and loud explosions that appear to take centre stage while the Bond character is almost relegated to second string . " Roger Moore remarked , " I thought it just went too far – and that ’ s from me , the first Bond in space ! Invisible cars and dodgy CGI footage ? Please ! " 
 Die Another Day was written into a novel by the then @-@ current official James Bond writer , Raymond Benson , based on the screenplay by Neal <unk> and Robert Wade . Fan reaction to it was above average . After its publication Benson retired as the official James Bond novelist and a new series featuring the secret agent 's adventures as a teenager , by Charlie <unk> , was launched in 2005 . As the <unk> was published after Benson 's final original <unk> novel , The Man with the Red <unk> , it was the final literary work featuring Bond as originally conceived by Ian Fleming until the publication of Devil May Care by Sebastian <unk> in 2008 to mark the 100th anniversary of Fleming 's birth . 
 <unk> arose in 2003 of a spin @-@ off film concentrating on Jinx , which was scheduled for a November / December 2004 release . It was originally reported that MGM was keen to set up a film series that would be a " winter <unk> " alternative to ' James Bond ' . In the late 1990s , MGM had originally considered developing a spin @-@ off film based on Michelle Yeoh 's character , <unk> Lin , in 1997 's Tomorrow Never Dies . However , despite much speculation of an imminent movie , on 26 October 2003 , Variety reported that MGM had completely pulled the <unk> on this project , to the dismay of Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson of <unk> Entertainment , who were reported to be " clearly furious " about the decision . MGM were keen to instead move on with the next film , Casino <unk> . 
 <unk> is an advocate of increased ethnic representation in the entertainment industry , and in 2001 founded her own production company , producing the short film <unk> 's <unk> for the Cannes film festival in order to further her campaign . In 2006 , <unk> was shortlisted for the ' Female Performance in TV ' award in the Screen Nation Awards , receiving Honourable Mention in the same category in 2007 , and a further shortlisted nomination in 2008 . She is married to fellow actor Adam <unk> , with whom she has two daughters . 
 <unk> began her career in the theatre , performing in a number of Shakespearean plays including Twelfth Night , A Midsummer Night 's Dream , The Tempest , The <unk> of Venice and Macbeth . She states of this : " Shakespeare keeps coming my way . I love the fact that I get to play people who are much more articulate than I 'll ever be " . <unk> has performed in Twelfth Night in the lead roles of both Olivia and Viola . She explains : " The role of Viola didn 't sit that well with me for some reason but Olivia makes more sense . " She has also appeared in modern performances , assuming the title role of <unk> , Queen of <unk> at the Globe Theatre in London in 2003 , which she described as " a dream of a part " . She has deemed her dream role to be that of Isabella in Measure for Measure , as she once lost out on the part and would like to prove herself capable of playing it . 
 <unk> signed a three @-@ year contract to play <unk> , and described herself as " very similar " to her character , speaking positively about her working relationship with co @-@ stars Jaye <unk> and Sharon D. Clarke , as well as the " dream " storylines her character was given . She said of the show : 
 " I really love <unk> and I 'm surprised how much . What thrills me about <unk> is that you get back what you put in . The powers that be are only as interested in you as they think you are in the job . For me it 's about more than turning up and saying the lines . It 's about understanding it and trying to make it better . That 's actually a lot of fun . What 's great is nobody says , ' Just shut up . ' They want you to work at it . [ ... ] I surprise myself sometimes because after two and a half years sometimes I see friends on the side of a poster and I think , ' do I want to do something else ? ' but I really like this job , I never get that awful ‘ <unk> ’ feeling when you really don ’ t want to go into work . " 
 In October 2008 , <unk> announced that she would be departing from <unk> City in order to have a second child , stating : " I 've had a great time and I 'll miss it . I made the decision purely because I was pregnant , but I wasn 't really ready to put down the character of <unk> . I 'm very sorry to have to let her go . " 
 <unk> was nominated and shortlisted for the ' Female Performance in TV ' award in the 2006 Screen Nation Awards , for her role as <unk> Tyson in <unk> City . She received Honourable Mention for the same role the following year , and was shortlisted again in 2008 . In 2005 , <unk> voted <unk> the 29th <unk> woman in Wales , saying of her : " One of our favourite <unk> , she 's black , beautiful and the term " <unk> mummy " should have been made for her . " She placed 40th in 2008 , with the Western Mail noting : " the last 15 years have only seen <unk> become more beautiful and more successful " . <unk> placed 17th in the awards in 2009 . 
 <unk> describes herself as " optimistic , cynical , lazy , naive [ and ] honest " . She spends her free time " watching television , the theatre , cinema , concerts , indoor wall climbing [ and ] keeping fit [ with ] <unk> [ and ] aerobics " . She has a collection of <unk> dolls which she keeps under her bath . <unk> has an interest in travel , and has visited Peru and Kenya among other destinations . She has expressed a desire to visit Brazil and Argentina , and has " a romantic notion of travelling around Europe in a <unk> van " . <unk> often speaks of her pride in her Welsh upbringing , describing herself as " an Ely girl through and through " . She was made a Fellow of the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama in 2003 . 
 During a 1998 production of Hamlet , <unk> met her future husband , fellow actor Adam <unk> – son of Love <unk> <unk> star Jack <unk> . They met again two years later , during a production of Twelfth Night , and went on to become a couple . The pair married in May 2004 , and <unk> gave birth to their first daughter in July that year . Their second daughter was born in January 2009 . 
 <unk> has undertaken the following roles from her screen and <unk> debut in 1993 , to the present day . 
 The Pike @-@ Pawnee Village Site , or Hill Farm Site , designated <unk> by archaeologists , is a site near the village of Guide Rock in Webster County , in the south central portion of the state of Nebraska , in the Great Plains region of the United States . It was the location of a village of the <unk> band of the Pawnee people , in a region of the Republican River valley that they occupied intermittently from the 1770s to the 1820s . 
 In 1806 , the village was visited by a Spanish expedition led by Lieutenant <unk> <unk> and , soon after , by an American expedition led by Lieutenant <unk> Pike . At the village , Pike persuaded the Pawnee leaders to haul down a Spanish flag that they had received from <unk> , and to raise the flag of the United States in its stead . 
 The location of the village visited by Pike was not known for many years . In the early 20th century , two sites were proposed : this one in Nebraska , and one in Republic County in northern Kansas . A dispute between the historical societies of the two states ensued , titled " The War Between Nebraska and Kansas " . The dispute was eventually resolved in favor of the Nebraska site . 
 Investigations conducted at the site by William Duncan Strong , Waldo <unk> , and A. T. Hill were instrumental in the development of Great Plains archaeology , and of Pawnee archaeology in particular . 
 The site is a National Historic Landmark , and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places . 
 The site lies on a terrace on the Republican River 's south side , near the village of Guide Rock . At the terrace 's north edge is a near @-@ vertical 25 – 30 @-@ foot ( 8 – 9 m ) bank ; the floodplain of the river extends about one @-@ fourth mile ( about one @-@ half kilometer ) from the bank 's base to the present channel . The remains of over 100 earth <unk> lie on the terrace between the bank and hills to the south , which rise 125 feet ( 38 m ) above the site . On the hills are five <unk> . The village complex also includes a council site and two open courts where a <unk> game was played . 
 The village extended for at least 1 @,@ 200 feet ( 370 m ) from east to west . On its east and west sides were creeks , now dry , that ran northward into the Republican . At the time of the village 's occupation , springs in the western creek flowed year @-@ round ; these would have provided a more convenient source of water than the river , since access to the latter was hampered by the steep bank . The springs ceased to flow at some time after the land came under cultivation in the 1870s . 
 Not far downstream from the site is a hill known to the <unk> as <unk> @-@ <unk> , or " hill that points the way " . In the traditional Pawnee religion , this was one of five <unk> of the <unk> , spirit animals with supernatural healing powers . 
 The ancestors of the modern Pawnee people were not a single unified tribe . At the middle of the 18th century , they consisted of two major groups . The <unk> , or Wolf <unk> , had migrated northward with the <unk> , and had probably been in Nebraska since 1600 or earlier . By the beginning of the 18th century , they were established on the <unk> River , which flows through central Nebraska into the Platte River from the north . 
 The second major division of the ancestral <unk> was the Southern , or Black <unk> . Their migration history is not well documented ; but by <unk> they , with the related and allied <unk> , had established what seemed to be a secure territory on the Arkansas River . 
 The security of the southern bands depended on French trade in arms , and this was disrupted by the French and Indian War ( 1754 – 63 ) . In 1763 , France surrendered the Louisiana Territory under the terms of the Treaty of <unk> . Great Britain obtained the portion of the territory east of the Mississippi River . Spain received the territory west of the Mississippi , including New Orleans , although they did not make their claim to that city effective until Governor Alejandro O <unk> suppressed the Rebellion of 1768 . Once in control of New Orleans , the Spanish imposed severe restrictions on trade up the Mississippi , cutting off the supply of arms to the Southern <unk> and <unk> . 
 The neighboring <unk> were not so affected , as they had access to arms smuggled by French traders from British territory in present @-@ day Illinois . With superior weaponry , they drove between the Southern <unk> and the <unk> , pushing the latter group southward to the Red River . The <unk> moved northward into Nebraska , possibly because of news that modern weapons were available from traders on the Platte . 
 The dates of the moves are not known exactly . The Wichita move from the Arkansas to the Red occurred at some time between 1768 and 1772 . The <unk> occupied the former Pawnee @-@ Wichita hunting grounds on the Arkansas in 1774 , indicating that the <unk> had left by then ; in 1777 , a Spanish report indicated that they were in Nebraska . 
 There is much debate among historians and archaeologists concerning the dates of occupation of the Webster County village . Four <unk> village sites on the Republican are known , two of them quite large : this one , and the Pawnee Indian Village Site near Republic , Kansas , 49 kilometres ( 30 mi ) downstream . The band inhabited the Republican valley intermittently from the 1770s to the 1820s . Unfortunately , there is little information on which villages were occupied at what times , although there is a strong consensus that this village is the one visited by Pike in 1806 . The following account , therefore , can only describe what is known about <unk> occupation and abandonment of the Republican valley , and not the history of this particular village . 
 The <unk> did not live in their villages year @-@ round . In the spring , they planted and <unk> crops near their villages . In mid @-@ June , they left on their summer buffalo hunt . In September , they returned to harvest the crops and to hold their harvest festival ; they then <unk> a portion of their food in their villages and left on the winter buffalo hunt , from which they did not return until planting time in the spring . Thus the villages were deserted for at least eight months of the year . 
 The <unk> also moved , both in small groups and en <unk> , between the Republican and the Platte . The <unk> and the <unk> seem to have lived together <unk> from the time of their arrival in Nebraska . However , the <unk> were divided between those who wanted to live independently on the Republican , and those who wanted to live near the <unk> on the Platte . The three bands frequently moved together on the summer and winter buffalo hunts , so there was regular contact between them . It was common for people to move from one household to another , especially upon returning from a buffalo hunt ; this would have facilitated moves from village to village . 
 At times , the entire <unk> band abandoned the Republican and moved to the Platte . Generally , this took place in times of war , when the bands sought protection in numbers . Movement between the Republican and the Platte probably occurred continually until about 1825 . 
 The conflict with the <unk> probably took place sometime between 1770 and 1775 . It concluded with the defeat of the <unk> , who , although nominally conquered , remained on the <unk> and continued to hunt separately from the other three bands . By 1777 , the <unk> had moved back to the Republican . 
 At some time between 1777 and 1785 , the <unk> again abandoned and then re @-@ occupied the Republican valley . A Spanish account of 1785 describes a village on the south side of the Platte in Butler County , not far from the modern town of <unk> , Nebraska ; this village was occupied by the <unk> until about 1785 , when they returned to the Republican . 
 War came to the <unk> on the Republican in 1798 . The <unk> , under the leadership of Chief <unk> , had become perhaps the most powerful group in Nebraska . They were located at the junction of the French trade route up the Missouri River and an overland route across northern Iowa whereby the Sac and Fox brought British arms and goods westward . This allowed them to levy tribute and exercise control over trade on the Missouri . 
 When <unk> learned of this , he ordered an attack on the <unk> . The <unk> descended upon the band 's village , burned and plundered many of the <unk> , and killed about one hundred <unk> at the cost of about fifteen of their own men . The remaining <unk> had withdrawn into four <unk> , occupying a position too strong for the <unk> to reach them and massacre them without unacceptable losses . 
 Whether the Republican valley was abandoned after the Omaha attack is not recorded . The invading <unk> had camped on the Platte , undisturbed by the <unk> , on their way to the <unk> ; this might indicate that the two Pawnee bands were on bad terms at the time . The power of the <unk> was broken soon thereafter : in about 1801 , a smallpox epidemic spread from the <unk> to the <unk> , killing half of the tribe , <unk> among them . 
 When the Lewis and Clark Expedition reached the Platte in 1804 , they found the <unk> ( whom they mistakenly called <unk> ) living there . They were told that the band had returned to the Republican about ten years before ( that is , before the conflict with the <unk> ) , but had recently moved to the Platte under pressure from the <unk> . By 1806 , however , the <unk> were at peace with the <unk> , and were once again living on the Republican . 
 Under the 1800 Treaty of San <unk> , Spain returned the Louisiana Territory to France . In connection with this transfer , France agreed not to sell the territory to a third party ; French foreign minister <unk> had indicated that a strong French Louisiana would halt the expansion of Britain and the United States in the New World . 
 Napoleon quickly reneged on this agreement . In the 1803 Louisiana Purchase , France sold the territory to the United States . This led to conflict between the latter nation and Spain . The Spanish contended that the sale of Louisiana to the United States was invalid , and that the territory had reverted to them . Although they were unable to prevent American occupation of New Orleans , they sought to check American activity west of the Mississippi River . 
 Spain and the United States both sought allies among the Native Americans of the disputed territory . In June 1806 , Lieutenant <unk> <unk> and 600 men were dispatched from the Spanish provincial capital of Santa Fe down the Red River and then northward into present @-@ day Nebraska . Although no Spanish records of the <unk> expedition are known to exist , it is believed that its purpose was to find and arrest the Lewis and Clark party , and to establish <unk> with the Native Americans of the region , including the <unk> . 
 About a month later , Lieutenant <unk> Pike left St. Louis with an American party of 23 men , and orders to negotiate peace between the <unk> and <unk> , to contact the <unk> of the high plains , and to explore the headwaters of the Red and Arkansas Rivers . For guides and <unk> to the <unk> , Pike turned to the <unk> ; his Osage and Pawnee guides led him northwest through present @-@ day Kansas toward the <unk> village on the Republican . 
 <unk> was the first to arrive at the village . His journey north had not been easy . <unk> had broken out and been suppressed among his New Mexican militia ; and many of his horses had gone lame , or had been stolen by Pawnee raiders . He had left 240 of his men on the Arkansas in southern Kansas before turning northward with the other half of his force . In the Republican village , he met with <unk> and <unk> leaders , to whom he presented gifts , including Spanish flags . The <unk> agreed to expel Americans from their territory , but also opposed the <unk> expedition 's continuing to the Missouri River . In the face of this opposition , and with no supply lines and a force too large to live off the country , <unk> returned to the Arkansas and <unk> to Santa Fe . 
 Pike 's party reached the <unk> village on September 25 , 1806 , shortly after <unk> 's departure . Upon his arrival , he was greeted by the ranking chief , <unk> , who invited him to eat in his <unk> and told him of <unk> 's recent visit . The <unk> presented eight horses to the <unk> accompanying Pike , and members of the two tribes smoked pipes together . Pike 's party established a camp fortified with rifle pits on a hill on the north bank of the Republican opposite the village . 
 On the following day , a delegation of 12 <unk> arrived at the village ; on September 28 , they held a council with the <unk> . <unk> were smoked in token of peace between the tribes . 
 On September 29 , Pike held a " grand council " with the <unk> . At this council , one of <unk> 's Spanish flags was displayed at the chief 's <unk> . Pike urged the <unk> to haul it down and replace it with that of the United States . When the Pawnee chiefs <unk> , 
 ... I again reiterated the demand for the flag , adding " that it was impossible for the nation to have two fathers ; that they must either be the children of the Spaniards , or acknowledge their American father " . After a silence of some time an old man rose , went to the door , took down the Spanish flag , brought it and laid it at my feet ; he then received the American flag , and elevated it on the staff which had lately borne the standard of his Catholic Majesty . 
 This was favorably received by the <unk> and <unk> , but apparently caused distress to the <unk> . <unk> this , Pike returned the Spanish flag to them , asking only that they not fly it during his party 's stay in the village . " At this , there was a general shout of applause ... " 
 Pike had planned for the <unk> to guide him to the <unk> . However , upon his arrival at the village , he was informed that the two tribes were at war . When Pike expressed his intention of continuing inland toward the headwaters of the Arkansas , <unk> urged him to turn back : he had prevented the Spanish from going further into American territory , and would likewise resist an American movement toward Spanish land . 
 ... that the young warriors of his great American father were not women , to be turned back by words ; that I should therefore proceed , and if he thought proper to stop me , he could attempt it ; but that we were men , well armed , and would sell our lives at a dear rate to his nation ; that we knew our great father would send his young warriors there to gather our bones and revenge our deaths on his people ... 
 The <unk> relented , though <unk> and with much dissent . Pike obtained horses from them , and set out on October 7 . He ordered his party to stay in a compact body , with guns and bayonets and <unk> at the ready ; he estimated that " it would have cost them at least 100 men to have <unk> us " . With no guides to the <unk> , he was forced to abandon that part of the mission ; instead , he returned south into Kansas , where he attempted to follow <unk> 's trail toward the Arkansas . 
 <unk> was a <unk> who , at some time before 1805 , had been involved in a struggle over the leadership of that band . In the course of this struggle , he had brought his clan to the <unk> village on the Republican , where he had deposed <unk> , the hereditary chief of the <unk> . Although the exact situation is not known , it is thought that <unk> was trying to bring the <unk> back to the Platte , to support his faction in the <unk> village . 
 After 1806 , the Spanish continued their efforts to win the friendship of the <unk> . <unk> were dispatched to the Pawnee chiefs , urging them to come to Santa Fe ; and most of these messages went to <unk> . The fact that he received them while Long Hair , the <unk> head chief , was ignored , fed his self @-@ importance . In 1809 , in an ill @-@ judged attempt to impress the <unk> , he led the <unk> to war with the <unk> . By 1811 he had been defeated , and the <unk> had been forced to abandon the Republican and move to the Platte . 
 There is no firm documentary evidence of occupation of the Webster County village after 1809 . However , analysis of pottery and glass beads suggests that the site was re @-@ occupied during the second decade of the 19th century ; and three letters from 1823 and 1825 suggest that the <unk> were living on the Republican . By 1833 , however , the village had been abandoned and the band was living on the <unk> River . In that year , the four Pawnee bands , treated as a single tribe by the U.S. government , signed a treaty in which they gave up their lands south of the Platte . 
 Webster County was opened to <unk> in 1870 . In 1872 , the village site was <unk> and placed under cultivation . 
 In 1875 , Elizabeth Johnson discovered the remains of a Pawnee village in Republic County , Kansas . She thought that it might be the site of Pike 's flag incident ; but hearing of another village in Webster County , Nebraska , she dispatched her husband and another man to investigate this site . Because the surface had been altered by cultivation , they found little evidence of habitation , and Johnson was persuaded that the Republic County site was Pike 's village . She prevented its being <unk> on several occasions , and eventually purchased the land . 
 Johnson 's claim was supported by Elliott <unk> , who had edited Pike 's journal ; with his endorsement , it was accepted by the Kansas State Historical Society . In 1901 , Johnson donated the land to the state of Kansas , which built a 26 @-@ foot ( 7 @.@ 9 m ) granite monument commemorating Pike 's symbolic triumph over Spain . At the dedication of the monument , several of the speakers drew parallels between the Pike episode and the recent American victory in the Spanish – American War . In 1906 , a four @-@ day festival was held to celebrate the centennial of the flag incident . 
 One of those attending the 1906 ceremonies at the Kansas monument was A. T. Hill , a resident of Logan , Kansas . Hill had no formal training as an archaeologist — indeed , his formal education had ended in the fourth grade . However , he had developed a strong interest in the history and archaeology of the Great Plains . 
 Upon reading Pike 's journal , Hill became convinced that the Kansas site could not be the correct one . To him , the local topography did not appear to match that described by Pike ; and when he attempted to <unk> Pike 's route , he concluded that the actual village site must be some distance northwest of the Kansas monument . 
 In 1912 , Hill moved to Hastings , Nebraska , where he went to work for an automobile dealership . In his job , he traveled throughout central Nebraska ; in the course of this , he spoke with many collectors and investigated possible Pike sites . When he reached a managerial position at the dealership , he recruited his <unk> to bring him reports on archaeological sites and collections . 
 In 1923 , Hill learned of the remains of a Spanish saddle obtained from the George <unk> farm in Webster County . He visited the farm , and learned from <unk> , the son of the original <unk> , that when the land was first <unk> , it was covered with Native American relics . Hill opened a grave and found a Spanish <unk> bit and spur ; across the river , on land that had never been <unk> , he found traces of a camp , including rifle pits . The topography of the site closely matched Pike 's description ; and when Hill attempted to follow Pike 's route from the site to the Arkansas River , he recognized a number of landmarks from Pike 's account . 
 Hill called the attention of the Nebraska State Historical Society ( <unk> ) to the site and , in 1924 , joined representatives of the Society in conducting further excavations , showing that a village of considerable size had existed there . In 1925 , to ensure archaeological access to the site and to protect it from relic @-@ hunting , he bought the two farms on whose land it lay . Between 1924 and 1930 , he excavated two <unk> and over fifty graves . 
 By 1927 , Hill and the <unk> were persuaded that the Webster County site was the scene of the Pike flag incident . In that year , they challenged Kansas 's claim . A full issue of the Society 's journal , Nebraska History , was devoted to the matter . The issue , <unk> titled " The War Between Nebraska and Kansas " , included articles by representatives of the Nebraska society and of the Kansas Historical Society , each claiming the Pike site for his own state . 
 More than historical accuracy was at stake . In a 1901 address delivered at the Republic County site , Katherine S. Lewis of the Kansas <unk> of the American Revolution had declared that " we have been seeking out antiquity for Kansas ; we felt that our state was too new to be interesting " . In 1927 , <unk> still regarded their Pike site as a focus of state pride , and were unwilling to give it up : in the Nebraska History issue , George <unk> of the <unk> wrote , " It is now very strange that ... our Nebraska friends should become so enthusiastic in trying to take from our Pike 's Pawnee Republic Village its <unk> of glory . " 
 In their articles , the champions of each state argued that Pike 's account of his route supported their site , and entirely ruled out the other . Both sides also argued that Pike 's description of the local topography matched their site and differed significantly from the other . 
 The proponents of the Nebraska site cited the artifacts that had been recovered from their village . These included a Spanish peace medal dated 1797 and bearing the image of Charles IV , an American peace medal of the type issued after 1801 , and soldier 's buttons and brass <unk> bearing 15 stars , one of which bore the number " 1 " , that of Pike 's infantry regiment . 
 The <unk> had no such artifacts to show . However , they argued that the Nebraska village <unk> the Pike episode . The Kansas village , they stated , had been the one visited by Pike , and was occupied by the <unk> until they were driven north by the <unk> in the early 1830s ; the fleeing <unk> had then established the village on the Republican , where they had been devastated by smallpox . In this account the epidemic , and not long habitation , explained the number of graves found by Hill ; the medals had not been buried with their original owners , but had been <unk> by the band for decades , until the time that the pestilence was blamed on " evil gifts from the whites " and they were cast away . 
 Further work at both sites strengthened the case for Nebraska . Kansas supporters gave ground <unk> : a major celebration was held at the Republic County site in 1933 , and as late as 1947 , an article in the Kansas Historical Quarterly spoke of the issue as " <unk> ground " . Today , however , the Webster County site is generally acknowledged as the true one : an exhibit at the Republic County site states as much , and a Kansas historical marker near the 1901 monument states that " the village was long believed ... to be that visited by <unk> M. Pike " . 
 Although Elizabeth Johnson was mistaken about the Pike village site , her mistake is held to be a fortunate one . The Webster County site had been subjected to decades of cultivation and relic hunting . The Republic County site was not entirely pristine , due to surface collecting and possibly to amateur excavation ; but it was far better preserved . Today , the Kansas Historical Society operates a museum on the site , built in 1967 over one of the excavated earth <unk> . 
 Hill continued work at the site through 1930 . In that year , he was joined by William Duncan Strong , who the previous year had been named a professor of anthropology at the University of Nebraska , and by Strong 's research assistant Waldo <unk> . The collaboration of these three was crucial to the new science of Central Plains archaeology , and to Pawnee studies in particular : up to this time , the conventional wisdom among <unk> was that there was no useful archaeological work to be done on the Plains . In 1936 , <unk> published his 1930 master 's thesis as the seminal An Introduction to Pawnee Archaeology . 
 In the summer of 1941 , a <unk> crew excavated a number of <unk> , <unk> pits , and graves at the site . Some testing and surface collecting were conducted in 1943 . More recently , a magnetic survey was conducted over a portion of the village in 1982 , and some testing was carried out in 1987 . 
 Hill plotted the remains of 102 <unk> . Pike reported finding 44 <unk> at the village ; the difference is probably due to the abandonment or destruction of <unk> and the building of new ones on different sites . At least 90 graves have been investigated by archaeologists ; an estimated 75 – 100 additional graves are thought to have been opened by relic hunters . 
 In 1964 , the site was listed as a National Historic Landmark . In 1966 , it was added to the National Register of Historic Places . The boundaries of the historic site were expanded to nearly 300 acres ( 120 ha ) at some time in 1977 or later . 
 The site is owned and preserved by the Nebraska State Historical Society Foundation . There is no museum or visitor center there , and the site is not open to the public . 
 The Australian national baseball team represents Australia in international baseball tournaments and competitions . They are ranked as the top team in Oceania , and are the <unk> Champions , having been awarded the title in 2007 when New Zealand withdrew from the Oceania Baseball Championship . After achieving a last ( 16th ) place in the 2013 World Baseball Classic , their ranked dropped to 13 , which is the lowest rank Australia ever got . The highest rank they have achieved was 9th . 
 The Australian team participated in the Summer Olympic Games in 1996 , 2000 and 2004 , but failed to qualify for 2008 . The team has also participated in both of the other major international baseball tournaments recognised by the International Baseball Federation ( <unk> ) : the Baseball World Cup and most recently the World Baseball Classic ( <unk> ) . 
 The team is controlled by the Australian Baseball Federation , which is represented in the Baseball Confederation of Oceania ( <unk> ) . Prior to the <unk> 's formation , Australia competed in the Asian Baseball Championship under the Baseball Federation of Asia ( <unk> ) . Australia continues to have a relationship with the <unk> ; the 2011 resumption of the Asia Series includes the Australian Baseball League 's champion team . 
 On 17 January 2013 , the Australian Baseball Federation announced the 28 players that made up the provisional roster for Australia at the 2013 World Baseball Classic in March . The final roster was announced on 20 February , and included only one change from the provisional roster : Shane Lindsay was added after Peter <unk> withdrew himself from the team as a result of signing with a new team , the Los Angeles Dodgers . 
 Of the players named in the roster , eight have previous Major League experience , four pitchers and four position players : Brad <unk> , Justin <unk> , Luke Hughes , Shane Lindsay , Chris <unk> , Ryan Rowland @-@ Smith , Chris Snelling and Brad Thomas . Assistant Coach Graeme Lloyd has also had 10 seasons as a Major League pitcher , including two World Series championships with the New York Yankees . Coaches Greg <unk> and Glenn Williams have also had Major League experience as players . Peter <unk> , 
 In January 2009 the International Baseball Federation created a ranking system so that the nations involved in international competition could be compared independently . Teams receive points based on the position they finish at the end of tournaments . The system takes into account results not only of the senior men 's teams but also of junior teams . <unk> that emphasise the importance of certain tournaments are based on the number of teams competing , the number of continents represented ( or eligible to be represented ) , and in the case of continental tournaments such as the Oceania Baseball Championship the relative strength of teams eligible . Only results within the previous four years are used , so points are added and removed over time . Since the system began , the rankings have been adjusted after the completion of tournaments qualifying for the ranking process ; the most recent was the 2009 Baseball World Cup . 
 When the rankings were first introduced , Australia was listed at 10th position . The high @-@ water mark was after the 2009 World Baseball Classic when they were in 9th . The lowest position they have been in the ranking since its inception is 11th . At the end of 2010 , Australia had returned to their original position of 10th . 
 In January 2009 the <unk> , in releasing the first edition of the world rankings , announced the classifications of various tournaments that contributed to the rankings themselves . In doing so , they identified that of the " world " tournaments , there were different levels with differing levels of <unk> towards the ranks : major world championships , minor world championships , world qualifying tournaments and continental championships / qualifying tournaments . 
 There are currently three recognised tournaments that are considered " major " by the <unk> : the World Baseball Classic , the Summer Olympic Games and the Baseball World Cup . Of those , the Summer Olympics will be phased out of the rankings structure , as baseball will no longer be contested as an Olympic event . 
 Australia has competed in all three editions of the World Baseball Classic . All sixteen teams that played in the 2006 edition were invited to compete in the second in 2009 . By virtue of their third @-@ place finish in their first @-@ round pool , Australia qualified compete at the 2013 edition of the <unk> . ; however , they were eliminated with an 0 – 3 record and finished in last place overall . 
 Australia , which has not progressed beyond the first round of competition , achieved its highest finish , 12th , in the 2009 tournament . <unk> for international competition in baseball , the squads selected in the World Baseball Classic tournaments featured players active in Major League Baseball in addition to Minor League , Nippon Professional Baseball and local players . Generally players in the Major <unk> are unavailable for international representative teams due to their contracts with the respective clubs . 
 Prior to formally starting their campaign , Australia played an exhibition game , which they lost , against a Boston Red Sox squad at City of <unk> Park in Fort Myers , Florida . This was also the site of their training camp . 
 Australia competed in Pool D — along with Dominican Republic , Italy and Venezuela — in the first round at <unk> Jack Stadium in Orlando , Florida . The other three teams were able to field a large number of Major League players . Of players born outside the United States on 2006 Major League Opening Day <unk> , the Dominican Republic ( 85 ) and Venezuela ( 43 ) had more than all other countries and between them accounted for more than 57 % of foreign @-@ born players in the leagues . Italy is among the top nations in Europe and had access to Italian @-@ American players under the eligibility rules for the tournament . Thus , Australia was considered the underdog in the pool . 
 Having failed to win any of their round @-@ robin pool games , they finished last in their pool , and were eliminated with Canada , China , Chinese <unk> , Italy , Netherlands , Panama and South Africa . The eventual champions were Japan . 
 Australia was based in <unk> , Arizona — the site of the Seattle Mariners spring training camp — for their preparation for the formal start of their 2009 campaign . Unlike 2006 , in which they had one exhibition game , they competed against three different Major League clubs : the Seattle Mariners , the Milwaukee Brewers and the Chicago White Sox . Their game against Seattle was Ken <unk> , Jr . ' s first game playing for the Mariners since October 1999 , and was also their first victory as part of a World Baseball Classic tour . 
 Australia was drawn in Pool B for the 2009 tournament , along with Cuba , Mexico and South Africa , competing at <unk> Sol Stadium in Mexico City . After beating Mexico in their opening game , they lost their next two games to Cuba and Mexico , and were eliminated from the tournament . The Australians set a <unk> record against Mexico : 22 hits in a single game is more than any other team has achieved in either tournament . 
 In June 2011 , it was announced that the field for the 2013 <unk> would be expanded to include an additional 12 teams and that a qualifying round would be several months prior to the main tournament . The qualifying tournament involved the 12 newly invited teams , as well as the four lowest @-@ placed teams from the 2009 tournament ; all teams who did not win a game . The qualifying tournament broke the teams into four pools of four teams each , which competed in a six @-@ game , modified double @-@ elimination format , similar to the first round of the 2009 tournament , with the winners of the sixth game in each pool proceeding to the main tournament . Australia , having finished 12th after beating Mexico in their first game in 2009 , automatically qualified for the main tournament . 
 The main tournament combined elements of both previous <unk> editions . The first round was split all teams into four pools , where the teams competed in a round @-@ robin , as was the case in the 2006 tournament . The second round used the same modified double @-@ elimination format as used in the 2009 tournament and the 2013 qualifying tournament . The final round was contested in the same manner as both previous tournaments : the top two teams from each group in the second round qualifying for the two semi @-@ final matches , the winners of which played in the championship game . 
 Australia was drawn into Pool B , which was held at the <unk> Intercontinental Baseball Stadium in Taiwan . In their opener , they fell to host and qualifiers Chinese <unk> , 4 – 1 . They followed up with a 6 – 0 loss to South Korea before finishing with a 4 – 1 defeat to the Netherlands . 
 Australia was the third nation , after the United States and Sweden , to participate in baseball at the Summer Olympics , making their first appearance at the 1956 Games in Melbourne , and again as part of its demonstration at the 1988 Games in Seoul . Though the sport has applied for re @-@ admission for 2016 , baseball is no longer contested as a medal event at the Olympics . 
 Since baseball was first included as a medal sport at the 1992 Games in Barcelona , Australia has participated in three of the five tournaments . The best result achieved was in the 2004 Games in Athens , where Australia lost the gold medal match to Cuba to receive silver . Their medal tally puts them at 5th , equal to Chinese <unk> . 
 Australia has participated in ten of the <unk> World Cup tournaments . To date its best result has been 5th , which Australia has achieved twice in both of the most recent tournaments held — 2009 and 2011 . At the 2007 tournament , Trent <unk> became the first Australian player to be named in a World Cup All Star team , in recognition of his tournament @-@ leading hitting and base @-@ running statistics . Australia is currently participating in the 2011 tournament in Panama . 
 Until 1986 , the World Cup was actually referred to as the " Amateur World Series " . The Amateur World Series only made use of round @-@ robin fixtures , with teams ranked at the end of the tournament . Australia 's first appearance was in Italy in 1978 . Out of the ten teams to compete , Australia finished 9th ahead of the other debuting team , Belgium . 
 Since the 1988 tournament , it has held the " World Cup " name , with the <unk> <unk> the past Amateur World Series winners as World Cup winners . With the change of name came a change in format for the tournament : a round @-@ robin phase , followed by a knockout phase for the top four teams . ( Later tournaments would see two pools used in the first phase , and an expanded knockout phase including the top four teams from each pool . ) In the " World Cup Era " , Australia has reached the final phase four times , finishing 7th in 1998 , 6th in 2007 and most recently 5th in 2009 and 2011 . 
 There are six separate tournaments that the <unk> currently recognises as " minor world championships " . Of those , Australia has only participated in one senior tournament : the Intercontinental Cup . ( Australia has also participated in the World Junior Baseball Championship and the World Youth Baseball Championship , both of which are also included in the same category for the <unk> rankings . ) 
 Australia is one of five nations to have won the Intercontinental Cup , winning the 1999 tournament by beating Cuba 4 – 3 in extra innings in front of a home crowd in Sydney . It was the first time Australia had won an international baseball tournament , and through 2009 the only win outside of the Oceania Baseball Championship . The team enjoyed several individual successes as well : 
 Dave Nilsson named tournament MVP , to go along with leading the tournament for runs batted in ( 12 ) and being named in the tournament all @-@ star team ( as catcher ) 
 Michael <unk> shared the lead in the tournament with Oscar <unk> ( Cuba ) , with the most home runs ( 3 ) 
 two other Australians were selected along with Dave Nilsson in the all @-@ star team : Adrian <unk> ( right @-@ handed pitcher ) and Michael <unk> ( designated hitter ) 
 It was only the third time Cuba had been beaten in the gold medal match in the tournament 's history , having reached the tournament <unk> every time they have participated . Australia also shares another honour with Cuba : of the nine nations to have hosted the tournament , only Australia and Cuba have won as hosts , combining for five tournament wins from five times hosted . ( Cuba in 1979 , 1987 , 1995 and 2002 , Australia in 1999 . ) 
 Australia first participated in the tournament at the 1981 Intercontinental Cup , managing only one win out of their seven games , finishing 8th . Missing the 1983 Intercontinental Cup , they returned in 1985 to repeat their previous performance : 1 win , 8th @-@ place finish . They would not reappear at the tournament until 1993 where they improved to a 5 – 4 record to finish in 6th position . Australia 's first medal performance at the Intercontinental Cup ( and their first medal at a world tournament ) was at the 1997 tournament . In their best performance through the preliminary round , they put together a 6 – 1 record losing only to eventual silver @-@ <unk> Cuba , and beating eventual gold @-@ <unk> Japan . They lost to Japan in the semi @-@ final , but beat the United States for the second time in the tournament to secure the bronze . 
 Australia also competed in the most recent tournament in 2006 . There they finished in 5th position , compiling a 3 – 4 record . This is likely to be the last edition of the tournament for the foreseeable future . 
 Australia is the second of only two nations to have participated in <unk> @-@ sanctioned continental tournaments for more than one continent : the Asian Baseball Championship between 1971 – 1993 , and the Oceania Baseball Championship since 2003 . The first nation to achieve this was Guam , who competed in the Asian tournament within the same <unk> as Australia , though they were involved in the first Oceania tournament in 1999 . 
 Australia is one of thirteen nations to have participated in the Asian Baseball Championship since the tournament was first held in 1954 . The last time they contested the championship was in 1993 , as a result of joining the newly formed Baseball Confederation of Oceania . Though their best result was a bronze medal in the 1975 , the only teams to consistently finish ahead of Australia were Japan , South Korea and Chinese <unk> — the top three teams in Asia , and all in the top five in the world . 
 Though scheduled to participate on three separate occasions , Australia has only contested the Oceania Baseball Championship once in 2003 . The two other times , Australia 's scheduled opponents — Guam in 2004 and New Zealand in 2007 — withdrew from competition in the lead up to each series , both times scheduled to be held in Sydney . Australia was awarded the championship both times , and as a result represented Oceania at the 2004 Summer Olympics and at the 2007 Baseball World Cup respectively . 
 Held during late April 2003 , Australia won its first continental championship , beating hosts Guam 12 – 1 , 12 – 1 and 5 – 1 to win the best of five series three games to one . ( Guam won the third game 8 – 2 . )

 Dixie Kong 's Double Trouble ! is a platform game where players control Dixie Kong and her cousin , <unk> Kong , through eight worlds which comprise a total of 48 levels . Many of the gameplay elements from previous games in the series mark a return in this game , such as barrels , bonus levels which reward the player with special " bonus coins " , <unk> coins , animal helpers and a multiplayer mode . Both of the two playable <unk> have unique abilities , such as Dixie 's ability to slow her descent by spinning her <unk> , and <unk> 's ability to bounce across open water .

The level design is more diverse compared to its predecessors , which includes more complex puzzles and obstacles . Every level has an enemy called a <unk> ; each of these enemies bears the <unk> <unk> of their respective level , holding it as a shield . As these enemies always face towards the player , they must be defeated by throwing a steel barrel over them so it <unk> off a wall behind them in order to strike them from behind . The game overworld is also more complex , allowing players to explore between each area instead of forcing them along a linear path . To achieve this , the game includes several vehicles such as a <unk> and <unk> which can be used to traverse the overworld and access different worlds .

A reviewer from Nintendo Master thought that the game 's main strengths were its " beautiful graphics and script " . A reviewer from <unk> asserted that the various aspects of gameplay made Dixie Kong 's Double Trouble ! a hallmark of the series . 
 The music received mixed opinions from critics . Although <unk> stated that the game 's music was " catchy " , he noted that devotees to the original <unk> Kong Country may not like it . Thomas thought compared to the other <unk> Kong Country games , the music in Dixie Kong 's Double Trouble ! stands out the least , although he stated that it was an " impressive effort " . Van <unk> similarly stated that the soundtrack was not as " legendary " as it was in its previous instalment , however he still admitted that it had some " great " tracks . In addition , Van <unk> criticised the Game Boy Advance 's port for replacing all of the original music with remixed versions . However , <unk> stated that the music was " just as good " as the original , regarding the soundtrack on the Game Boy Advance port . 
 Herbert <unk> <unk> ( February 10 , 1894 – January 30 , 1948 ) was an American professional baseball pitcher . He played in Major League Baseball from 1912 through 1933 . He is best known for his time spent with the star @-@ studded New York Yankee teams of the mid to late 1920s and early 1930s .

After the game , Ed Barrow , the new manager of the Red Sox , signed <unk> to a new contract after promising to use him regularly during the 1919 season . 
 <unk> received only one start apiece in the months of April and May , as the 1919 Red Sox relied on George <unk> , Bill James , and Bullet Joe Bush , leading <unk> to threaten to quit in late @-@ May unless Barrow fulfilled his earlier promise to <unk> . Barrow continued to use <unk> regularly after Memorial Day , and <unk> finished the season with a 16 – 8 win @-@ loss record and a 2 @.@ 71 ERA in 219 innings pitched . He served as the team 's ace pitcher in the 1920 season , but subsequently settled in as the Red Sox ' third starter . After the 1922 Red Sox campaign , in which he went 10 – 17 , and had seven wild pitches , leading the AL , the New York Yankees began to negotiate with the Red Sox to acquire <unk> .

 The 4th Armoured Brigade was an armoured formation of the Australian Army established during the Second World War . It was formed in February 1943 to provide armoured support for infantry units operating in the South West Pacific Area . Its composition varied over time , but usually comprised several armoured regiments equipped with Matilda II or M3 Grant tanks as well as some support units . 
 The brigade 's main role throughout its existence was to provide a pool of armoured units and sub @-@ units that could be deployed to augment infantry forces . It was also responsible for developing specialised variants of armoured vehicles . Elements of the 4th Armoured Brigade were detached to support most of the Australian Army 's major operations from 1943 until the end of the war , and from September 1944 it was the Army 's only armoured brigade . The formation was disbanded , after the war , in February 1946 . 
 The 4th Armoured Brigade was established in February 1943 as part of a reorganisation of the Australian Army 's armoured units . As there was no longer any threat of Japanese forces invading Australia , the 2nd Armoured Division was disbanded to free up manpower for other purposes . However , it was decided to retain the headquarters of that division 's 6th Armoured Brigade to command armoured units that were intended to take part in offensive operations in New Guinea and other locations in the South West Pacific . This specialised formation was designated the 4th Armoured Brigade . The need for armoured support of infantry forces had been demonstrated by the Army 's experiences in the New Guinea Campaign during 1942 and early 1943 . 
 The main role of the 4th Armoured Brigade was to provide <unk> of tanks to support infantry units . As it was not practical or necessary to deploy large armoured units in the jungle terrain common across the South West Pacific , the brigade was organised into several self @-@ supporting regimental groups . These regimental groups could in turn provide sub @-@ units with the necessary logistics support to form the armoured component of other units during combat operations . This held in practice ; during combat deployments regiments from the 4th Armoured Brigade were attached to infantry divisions or brigades , and their squadrons and troops generally operated independently as part of combined arms forces . 
 Upon formation , the main units of the 4th Armoured Brigade were the 1st Army Tank Battalion , 2 / 6th Armoured Regiment and 2 / 9th Armoured Regiment . The 1st Army Tank Battalion was equipped with Matilda II infantry tanks and had previously formed part of the 3rd Army Tank Brigade . The 2 / 6th Armoured Regiment had formed part of the 1st Armoured Division until August 1942 when it and its M3 Stuart light tanks were transferred to New Guinea . Elements of the regiment saw combat in the Battle of <unk> – <unk> , where the Stuart tanks were too lightly armoured to be effective . The 2 / 9th Armoured Regiment was transferred from the 3rd Armoured Division and equipped with M3 Grant medium tanks . The brigade also had several supporting engineer , medical , signals and services units . As the brigade was not intended to operate as a single unit , it lacked the armoured reconnaissance , artillery , combat engineer and infantry units which were standard elements of other Australian Army armoured brigades . The 4th Armoured Brigade 's commander from its establishment until its disbandment was Brigadier <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> . 
 The units of the 4th Armoured Brigade were concentrated at Singleton , New South Wales , on 10 March 1943 . As of April that year , the brigade formed part of the Land Headquarters Reserve . The 1st Army Tank Battalion was subsequently transferred to <unk> in southern Queensland and reorganised as a self @-@ supporting battalion group while remaining part of the 4th Armoured Brigade . The unit was redesignated the 1st Tank Battalion on 10 June 1943 , and in August that year was shipped to Milne Bay in New Guinea . It subsequently supported the 9th Division during the Landing at Lae and <unk> Peninsula campaign . The 1st Tank Battalion returned to Australia in June 1944 and was redesignated again to become the 1st Armoured Regiment . In the meantime the 2 / 4th Armoured Regiment was added to the 4th Armoured Brigade in October 1943 ; this unit had previously formed part of the 3rd Armoured Division and was re @-@ equipped with Matilda II tanks . Also in October 1943 , a party from the 4th Armoured Brigade armed with pistols was sent to <unk> Camp near Brisbane to put down a riot by soldiers being held under detention there , but did not need to use force . During March 1944 the 2 / 6th Armoured Regiment was transferred to the 1st Armoured Brigade Group , and the 2 / 5th Armoured Regiment was transferred from that formation to the 4th Armoured Brigade . 
 By mid @-@ 1944 the 4th Armoured Brigade was located in <unk> , Queensland . As of 1 June , the brigade had a strength of 4 @,@ <unk> men and was scheduled to be ready for offensive operations by October that year . During June it also established a training area at <unk> in Queensland , where armoured units could practice operating in tropical conditions . In September 1944 the brigade gained the 2 / 1st Armoured Brigade Reconnaissance Squadron when the 1st Armoured Brigade Group was disbanded ; this unit was reorganised to become the Armoured Squadron ( Special Equipment ) in January 1945 . The 2 / 6th Armoured Regiment was also re @-@ assigned to the 4th Armoured Brigade , but was stationed in the Sydney area . Following the disbandment of the 1st Armoured Brigade Group the 4th Armoured Brigade was the last remaining armoured brigade in the Australian Army . 
 The 4th Armoured Brigade 's structure continued to change during late 1944 and 1945 . The 2 / 1st Armoured <unk> Squadron was authorised to be raised as part of the brigade in October 1944 , but not established until May the next year . This squadron was to operate troop @-@ carrying Landing <unk> <unk> , but they did not arrive in time for the unit to see action before the end of the war . In January 1945 the 2 / 6th Armoured Regiment was transferred to the direct control of Land Headquarters , and moved to <unk> in Victoria the next month . This change proved short @-@ lived though , as the 2 / 6th Armoured Regiment rejoined the 4th Armoured Brigade at <unk> during July ; B Squadron of this regiment had been transferred to the brigade in April ahead of the remainder of the regiment moving from Victoria to Queensland . 
 One of the 4th Armoured Brigade 's regimental groups supported Australian Army offensive operations in New Guinea and <unk> during 1944 and 1945 . The 2 / 4th Armoured Regiment was transferred to New Guinea in August 1944 , and came under the command of the First Australian Army . From January 1945 until the end of the war , C Squadron of the 2 / 4th Armoured Regiment supported the 6th Division during the Aitape – <unk> campaign . The regimental headquarters and two other squadrons took part in the <unk> Campaign from October 1944 until the end of the war as part of II Corps . 
 During 1945 two 4th Armoured Brigade regimental groups saw action in the Borneo campaign . C Squadron of the 2 / 9th Armoured Regiment was attached to the 26th Brigade Group during the invasion of <unk> in May 1945 . The remainder of this regiment subsequently supported the 9th Division during the early stages of the Battle of North Borneo from 10 June . The 1st Armoured Regiment and Armoured Squadron ( Special Equipment ) were attached to the 7th Division , and took part in the Battle of <unk> from 1 July . 
 During 1944 the 4th Armoured Brigade provided crews for comparative trials of the American M4 Sherman and British Churchill tank in New Guinea conditions that were conducted by the Australian Army in response to a request from the British War Office . Before the tanks were sent to New Guinea , the 4th Armoured Brigade <unk> two Sherman tanks alongside Grants and Matilda <unk> in Queensland during mid @-@ 1944 . The <unk> and <unk> were subsequently <unk> in the <unk> region of New Guinea ; the Churchill proved better suited to jungle conditions . The Australian Army later ordered <unk> <unk> , but none were delivered before the end of the war . 
 By July 1945 the only elements of the 4th Armoured Brigade in Australia were the unit 's headquarters , the 2 / 5th and 2 / 6th Armoured Regiments and the 2 / 1st Armoured <unk> Squadron . The two regiments were preparing for offensive operations , including a planned but later cancelled invasion of Java , but did not leave Australia . 
 Most of the 4th Armoured Brigade 's units were rapidly disbanded following the war . The 2 / 1st Armoured <unk> Squadron was dissolved in August 1945 , and the Armoured Squadron ( Special Equipment ) followed in October that year . The 4th Armoured Brigade headquarters and 2 / 5th and 2 / 6th Armoured Regiments were disbanded in February 1946 , and the 2 / 9th Armoured Regiment during the early part of the year . Only the 1st Armoured Regiment remained an active unit , and returned to its pre @-@ war designation of the 1st Royal New South Wales <unk> in 1949 . Volunteers from the 4th Armoured Brigade manned the 1st Armoured Car Squadron , which was established in 1946 for service with the British Commonwealth Occupation Force in Japan ; in 1949 this squadron was expanded to form the 1st Armoured Regiment , which remains an active part of the Australian Army . A memorial to the 4th Armoured Brigade was dedicated at <unk> in 1993 .

 " <unk> " is a song by American recording artist Chris Brown . It is the second single from his third studio album <unk> , released as a digital download on November 24 , 2009 . The song was produced by The <unk> and was written by <unk> <unk> , Adam <unk> , Luke Boyd , and Brown . The song is about <unk> to rebuild a failed relationship and was interpreted by critics as being about Brown 's former relationship with Barbadian singer Rihanna . However , Brown has stated the song is not about any of his previous relationships . 
 The song received positive to mixed reviews . It charted in the top twenty in Japan and New Zealand , and the top forty in the United Kingdom and Ireland . It peaked in the United States at number fifty @-@ three . The accompanying music video features Brown and American R & B singer <unk> as his love interest . In the video , he <unk> for their relationship on a winter night in a city and in a desert scene . Brown performed the song on his 2009 Fan <unk> Tour , and on BET 's SOS : Help for Haiti <unk> , which benefited victims of the 2010 Haiti earthquake . 
 The song was leaked to internet on October 21 , 2009 , one day after ex @-@ girlfriend Rihanna 's ballad " Russian <unk> " was also leaked . The song , which has been described as " melancholy " , sees Brown singing about a relationship that has slipped out of his hands with its chorus calling for an " incremental reconciliation " of the unspecified relationship . <unk> Rodriguez of MTV News noted that both " <unk> " and Rihanna 's " Russian <unk> " would inevitably be interpreted as being about Brown and Rihanna 's relationship . 
 In an interview with MTV News , Brown stated that the song is not about Rihanna or any of his previous relationships . He called the message of the song " universal " , and not just about love but " any type of <unk> . " About the track he said , " When I heard the whole concept and everything I was like , ' Yo , this is crazy . So being able to express the feelings , it was like , probably one of the best [ records I 've done . ] But it was more than me trying to do a record that meant <unk> to love , <unk> back to love . Meaning whether it 's from your negative situations , whether it 's from any problems you 've dealt with , like anybody 's situation . " Although he stated his concept for the song was about love , he said for anybody , the song could be " inspired as far it being the war or a death in the family , whether it 's anything , anybody just <unk> back to love . " 
 After the song 's premiere on Brown 's <unk> website , " <unk> " made its official debut on the R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Songs chart at number ninety @-@ nine . After its release for digital download on November 23 , 2009 , it later peaked at fifty @-@ nine . On the week ending December 12 , 2009 , " <unk> " debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at sixty @-@ eight and peaked at fifty @-@ three . 
 On December 19 , 2009 , " <unk> " debuted on the UK Singles Chart at seventy @-@ six . In February , the song re @-@ entered the chart at eighty @-@ five , and debuted on the UK R & B chart at twenty @-@ five . On the week of February 27 , 2010 , the song reached its peak of number thirty @-@ five on the singles chart , and eventually peaked at number eight on the R & B chart . The song debuted and peaked on the New Zealand Singles Chart at number sixteen on the week beginning February 1 , 2010 . The song debuted and peaked at number thirty @-@ nine on the Irish Singles Chart , and reached number eight on the Dutch singles chart . It peaked at number twenty on the Japan Hot 100 , and ninety @-@ seven on the European Hot 100 . 
 The music video was edited by David Blackburn and directed by Joseph Kahn , who also worked with Brown on the " I Can <unk> Ya " and " Forever " videos . The video features American R & B singer <unk> as Brown 's love interest . Kahn had previously directed the video for Britney Spears 's 2008 ' comeback ' song , " <unk> " , after her public breakdown . In an interview with MTV News , Kahn said , " I seem to be the guy that record companies go to when they need help , " he joked . " I truly feel [ Brown ] is <unk> . You don 't drop people just because they made a mistake ( even if it was a big mistake ) . " 
 Kahn said that the entire idea for the video was Brown 's : " It 's an interesting video for me , because it 's so rare that music videos ever try to achieve anything emotional . Chris just basically told me a story of what he felt this video was going to be , with his heart glowing and how he 's , like , cold . It is a very personal story . But it 's told in such a graphic manner that I fell in love with the idea . It 's Chris ' story . Period . I am the pencil that put it down on the paper . " When comparing the song 's video to that of " I Can <unk> Ya " , the director said , " ' <unk> ' is my favorite one , because — <unk> , I 'm going to let you in on this — ' cause it 's probably his most personal thing he 's ever done . " He went on to say , " I mean , everything that 's happened to him in the year , I think this is going to be his big statement , in terms of what he 's feeling and what he 's living through right now . " When talking about the ideas and concepts of the video , Kahn said that the video , his first ballad with Brown , should speak for itself through the ideas that he had and the " genesis " of what that idea was . 
 Brown performed the song on his 2009 Fan <unk> Tour , and on Black Entertainment Television 's SOS Saving <unk> : Hope for Haiti <unk> , to raise money for the country after the 2010 earthquake that devastated the area . Eric <unk> of MTV News noted that although the song was <unk> to be about Rihanna , " the lyrics also at times seemed to fit the evening 's focus , like when Brown sang , " If we <unk> till we can walk again / Then we 'll run until we 're strong enough to jump . " 
 <unk> / <unk> / is a city in the U.S. state of Montana and is the county seat of <unk> County . It is located along the Clark Fork River near its <unk> with the <unk> and Blackfoot Rivers in western Montana and at the convergence of five mountain ranges , thus is often described as the " hub of five valleys " . In 2015 , the United States Census Bureau estimated the city 's population at 71 @,@ <unk> and the population of the <unk> Metropolitan Area at 114 @,@ 181 . In the 1990s , <unk> overtook Great Falls as Montana ’ s second ‑ largest city , behind <unk> . <unk> is home to the University of Montana , a public research university . 
 <unk> was founded in 1860 as <unk> Trading Post while still part of Washington Territory . By 1866 , the settlement had moved east , 5 miles ( 8 km ) upstream , and renamed <unk> Mills , later shortened to <unk> . The mills provided supplies to western settlers traveling along the <unk> Road . The establishment of Fort <unk> in 1877 to protect settlers further stabilized the economy . The arrival of the Northern Pacific Railway in 1883 brought rapid growth and the maturation of the local lumber industry . In 1893 , the Montana Legislature chose the city as the site for the state 's first university . Along with the U.S. Forest Service headquarters founded in 1908 , lumber and the university remained staples of the local economy for the next hundred years . 
 By the 1990s , <unk> 's lumber industry had gradually disappeared , and as of 2009 , the city 's largest employers were the University of Montana , <unk> County Public Schools , and <unk> 's two hospitals . The city is governed by a mayor – council government with twelve city council members , two from each of the six wards . In and around <unk> are 400 acres ( 160 ha ) of <unk> , 22 miles ( 35 km ) of trails , and nearly 5 @,@ 000 acres ( 2 @,@ 000 ha ) of open @-@ space conservation land with adjacent Mount Jumbo home to grazing elk and mule deer during the winter . The city is also home to both Montana 's largest and its oldest active <unk> as well as the Montana <unk> , one of the strongest college football programs in the Division I Football Championship <unk> of the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) . Notable residents include the first woman in the U.S. Congress , <unk> Rankin , and the United States ' longest @-@ serving Senate Majority Leader , Mike Mansfield . 
 The Lewis and Clark Expedition brought the first U.S. citizens to the area . They twice stopped just south of <unk> at Traveler 's Rest . They camped there the first time on their westbound trip in September 1805 . When they stayed there again on their return in June – July 1806 , Clark left heading south along the <unk> River and Lewis traveled north , then east , through <unk> Canyon . In 1860 , Hell Gate Village was established 5 miles ( 8 km ) west of present @-@ day downtown by Christopher P. Higgins and Frank <unk> as a trading post to serve travelers on the recently completed <unk> Road , the first wagon road to cross the Rocky Mountains to the inland of the Pacific Northwest . The desire for a more convenient water supply to power a lumber and flour mill led to the movement of the settlement to its modern location in 1864 . 
 <unk> remained a mainstay of industry in <unk> with the groundbreaking of the <unk> @-@ Waldorf pulp mill in 1956 , which resulted in protests over the resultant air pollution . An article in Life magazine thirteen years later speaks of <unk> sometimes needing to drive with <unk> on during the day to navigate through the <unk> . In 1979 , still almost 40 % of the county 's labor income came from the wood and paper products sector . The lumber industry was hit hard by the recession of the early 1980s , and <unk> 's economy began to <unk> . By the early 1990s , the disappearance of many of the region 's log yards , along with legislation , had helped clean the skies dramatically . 
 As of 2009 , education and healthcare were <unk> 's leading industries ; the University of Montana , <unk> County Public Schools , and the city 's two hospitals were the largest employers . St. Patrick Hospital and Health Sciences Center , founded in 1873 , is the region 's only Level II trauma center and has undergone three major expansions since the 1980s . Likewise , the University of Montana grew 50 % and built or renovated 20 buildings from 1990 – 2010 . It is expected that these industries as well as expansions in business and professional services , and retail will be the main engines of future growth . 
 <unk> is located at the western edge of Montana approximately 45 miles ( 70 km ) from the Idaho border . The city is at an elevation of 3 @,@ <unk> feet ( 978 m ) above sea level , with nearby Mount Sentinel and Mount Jumbo steeply rising to 5 @,@ 158 feet ( 1 @,@ <unk> m ) and 4 @,@ <unk> feet ( 1 @,@ 453 m ) respectively .

 <unk> began as a trading post in the 1860s situated along the <unk> Military Road to take advantage of the first route across the <unk> Mountains to the plains of Eastern Washington . Its designation as county seat in 1866 and location of the hastily built Fort <unk> in 1877 ensured <unk> 's status as a regional commercial center ; a status further consolidated in 1883 with the arrival of the Northern Pacific Railway . The railroad expanded <unk> 's trade area to cover a 150 @-@ mile radius , and <unk> 's location as the railway 's division point and repair shops provided hundreds of jobs . When the railway began expanding again in 1898 , increased freight shipments came through the city , and with the arrival of the Milwaukee Road and regional office for the U.S. Forest Service as well as the opening of the <unk> Indian <unk> to settlement all within a couple years of each other beginning in 1908 , the economy began to rapidly expand . 
 Since opening in 1895 , the University of Montana has had a major impact on the development of <unk> 's economy . In addition to the economic advantage from <unk> the student body , it gave the city an educated workforce not available in most of the state . The university has a close relationship with the city as <unk> 's largest employer and with the millions of dollars the school brings into the city through visitors of school @-@ sponsored sporting and cultural events . The university also houses <unk> 's only business <unk> , the Montana Technology Enterprise Center ( <unk> ) , and several start @-@ up businesses . 
 As of 2013 , <unk> ranked <unk> nationally in gross metropolitan product with an output of $ 5 billion , while the city 's total personal income ranked 333 at $ 4 @.@ 18 billion , an increase of more than 47 % since 2003 . As of 2013 , per capita personal income ranked 239 at $ 37 @,@ <unk> a year , 84 % of the national average . The <unk> metropolitan area 's unemployment rate was 3 @.@ 7 % As of June 2015 , dropping nearly 0 @.@ 8 % in the twelve months prior . 
 <unk> , often considered the cultural center of Montana , is the location of the state 's first university , and an eclectic mix of loggers , <unk> , college students , sports fans , and <unk> . Community events generally take place downtown either outdoors or in one of the several downtown buildings listed on the National Historic <unk> . 
 The Montana Museum of Art & Culture , which became a state museum in 2001 , is one Montana 's oldest cultural reserves , having begun in 1894 ; its permanent collection of more than 10 @,@ 000 original works . The <unk> Museum of Art is housed in a former Carnegie library ; it features contemporary art and annually features 20 – 25 group and solo exhibits . Fort <unk> is home to the Historic Museum , dedicated to preserving the history of Western Montana , and to the Rocky Mountain Museum of Military History and the Northern Rockies Heritage Center . The National Museum of Forest Service History is constructing the National Conservation Legacy and Education Center in <unk> as well . 
 <unk> plays host to a variety of intercollegiate , youth , and amateur sports organizations in addition to a Minor league baseball team . The Montana <unk> ' football and basketball teams of the University of Montana have the highest attendance .

 <unk> 's system of government has changed four times since 1883 when an <unk> form of government was approved with the town charter . The city adopted a commission @-@ council form of government in 1911 with the opening of new City Hall and a council – manager government in 1954 before returning to an <unk> form of government in 1959 . Since January 1 , 1997 , <unk> has been governed in accordance with the <unk> City Charter , which calls for a mayor @-@ council system of government . 
 The current system comprises a mayor and city treasurer elected in a <unk> vote and twelve city council members who must reside in and are elected from one of six wards with each ward having two council members . All positions are nominally <unk> . Council members and the mayor are elected to four @-@ year terms with council @-@ member elections being <unk> to allow only one member from each ward to up for re @-@ election . There are no term limits for either position . 
 <unk> 's state legislative delegation is the second largest in the Montana Legislature and is represented by districts 91 – 100 in the Montana House of Representatives and districts 46 – 50 in the Montana Senate . Having thirteen Democrats and two Republicans in its state legislative delegation , <unk> is known as a more liberal area than the rest of the state . 
 Though <unk> 's political <unk> may not be unique for a college town , its initiative to make marijuana possession the lowest priority of law enforcement in 2006 , and symbolic resolutions calling on Congress to withdraw from Iraq in 2007 , and to amend the U.S. Constitution to declare that " corporations are not human beings " in 2011 , often put it at odds with the rest of the state . In 2011 , the Montana legislature , with a Republican House majority , attempted to <unk> <unk> 's marijuana law and <unk> its ability to have an anti @-@ discrimination ordinance that included the <unk> community . The marijuana repeal was vetoed by then – Governor Brian <unk> and the attempt to repeal the other died in the Senate . 
 <unk> 's public schools are part of the <unk> County Public School districts 1 , 4 , 20 , and 23 . In <unk> , there are nine public elementary schools ( kindergarten to 5th grade ) , three public middle schools ( 6th to 8th grades ) , four public high schools ( 9th to 12th grades ) , and three public schools serving kindergarten to 8th grade . <unk> also has several private schools including an international school , religious @-@ affiliated schools , as well as Next <unk> <unk> , a theater academy high school operated by the <unk> Children 's Theatre . 
 The University of Montana dominates higher education in <unk> . The university , established in 1893 , was Montana 's first , and has the state 's second @-@ largest enrollment , with 12 @,@ 922 students as of 2015 ) . The campus houses six colleges and three schools including Montana 's first and only law school , the Alexander <unk> III School of Law at the University of Montana . The university is also the location of the state 's Regional Federal <unk> Library , and houses the state <unk> . The University of Montana College of Technology , established in 1956 and formerly known as the <unk> <unk> Technical Center , offers fast @-@ track learning programs . Multiple vocational programs not affiliated with the university ranging from photography and <unk> to truck driving also have a presence in <unk> . 
 Following the <unk> of Montana 's electricity market in 1997 , Montana Power Company began to <unk> its energy business . MPC sold substantially all its electrical generating assets to the PPL Corporation in December 1997 and its energy transmission and distribution business to <unk> Corporation in February 2002 . Despite filing for bankruptcy in 2002 , <unk> Corporation 's subsidiary <unk> Energy is the primary provider of electric and natural gas service to <unk> in addition to the Rural Utilities Service 's <unk> Electric Cooperative . 
 The city is divided into 18 neighborhood councils of which all <unk> residents are a member . The city further contains 10 historical districts : Downtown <unk> , East Pine Street , Fort <unk> , Lower <unk> , McCormick , <unk> , <unk> , University Area and , the campus of the University of Montana . 
 Direct intercity ground travel needs are provided by bus carriers <unk> Lines and <unk> <unk> . <unk> rail travel was available from 1883 , when the Northern Pacific Railway began service through <unk> , until 1979 when Amtrak discontinued its North Coast <unk> route across southern Montana . In 1901 , Northern Pacific built their station at the terminus of Higgins Avenue ; since 1985 , it has been on the National Register of Historic Places . A feasibility study was commissioned by Congress in 2008 to examine the merits of reopening the North Coast <unk> , but as of 2008 , the nearest rail station to <unk> is the <unk> station of Amtrak 's Empire <unk> , 136 miles ( 219 km ) to the north . 
 Author Norman Maclean grew up in <unk> and wrote about it in his 1976 autobiographical novella A River <unk> Through It . The work was adapted into a 1992 motion picture of the same name , directed by Robert <unk> , starring Brad Pitt and Craig <unk> . 
 <unk> : <unk> and the Justice System in a College Town is the title of a 2015 book by Jon <unk> that looked at the Justice Department 's investigation into a " pattern of disrespect and indifference toward alleged victims " by <unk> law enforcement in sexual assault cases between 2010 and 2012 , some involving football players from the Montana <unk> . While being interviewed on NPR about the book , John <unk> stated " I don 't mean to single out <unk> : Its rape rate is a little less than the national average ; I think its problems with dealing with rape are pretty <unk> typical " . 
 There is a lengthy study of <unk> in the title essay of Jonathan <unk> 's Driving Home : An American Journey : despite writing that on his arrival , " I had the powerful impression that I had driven deep into the Rocky Mountains and somehow arrived in Rotherham or Barnsley , " and that " the overall effect [ of the city ] was oddly unsettling ; the streets too open for comfort , the town too closed in , inducing mild <unk> and <unk> at the same time " , he notes the literary heritage of the city and its reputation as a " kindly town " ( evidenced by its being a place where " odds and ends naturally collected and <unk> " ) . 
 <unk> was portrayed in an episode of the CBS show Criminal <unk> . The episode aired on November 5 , 2014 . 
 <unk> ( as well as <unk> , <unk> ) was also portrayed in the movie <unk> Factor released in 1999 starring <unk> <unk> and Cuba <unk> , Jr . 
 A gene is a <unk> ( or region ) of DNA which is made up of <unk> and is the molecular unit of heredity . The transmission of genes to an organism 's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of <unk> traits . Most biological traits are under the influence of <unk> ( many different genes ) as well as the gene – environment interactions . Some genetic traits are instantly visible , such as eye colour or number of limbs , and some are not , such as blood type , risk for specific diseases , or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life . In July 2016 , scientists reported identifying a set of 355 genes from the Last Universal Common <unk> ( <unk> ) of all organisms living on Earth . 
 <unk> can acquire mutations in their sequence , leading to different variants , known as <unk> , in the population . These <unk> encode slightly different versions of a protein , which cause different phenotype traits . <unk> usage of the term " having a gene " ( e.g. , " good genes , " " hair colour gene " ) typically refers to having a different <unk> of the gene . <unk> evolve due to natural selection or survival of the <unk> of the <unk> . 
 The concept of a gene continues to be refined as new phenomena are discovered . For example , regulatory regions of a gene can be far removed from its coding regions , and coding regions can be split into several exons . Some viruses store their genome in RNA instead of DNA and some gene products are functional non @-@ coding <unk> . Therefore , a broad , modern working definition of a gene is any discrete <unk> of <unk> , <unk> sequence which affect an organism 's traits by being expressed as a functional product or by regulation of gene expression . 
 Prior to <unk> 's work , the dominant theory of heredity was one of blending inheritance , which suggested that each parent contributed fluids to the fertilisation process and that the traits of the parents blended and mixed to produce the offspring . Charles Darwin developed a theory of inheritance he termed <unk> , from Greek pan ( " all , whole " ) and genesis ( " birth " ) / <unk> ( " origin " ) . Darwin used the term <unk> to describe hypothetical particles that would mix during reproduction . 
 Sixteen years later , in 1905 , the word genetics was first used by William <unk> , while Eduard <unk> , amongst others , still used the term <unk> for the fundamental physical and functional unit of heredity . In 1909 the Danish botanist Wilhelm <unk> shortened the name to " gene " . 
 <unk> in understanding genes and inheritance continued throughout the 20th century . <unk> acid ( DNA ) was shown to be the molecular <unk> of genetic information by experiments in the 1940s to 1950s . The structure of DNA was studied by <unk> Franklin and Maurice <unk> using X @-@ ray crystallography , which led James D. Watson and Francis <unk> to publish a model of the double @-@ stranded DNA molecule whose paired nucleotide bases indicated a compelling hypothesis for the mechanism of genetic replication . <unk> , this body of research established the central <unk> of molecular biology , which states that proteins are translated from RNA , which is transcribed from DNA . This <unk> has since been shown to have exceptions , such as reverse transcription in <unk> . The modern study of genetics at the level of DNA is known as molecular genetics . 
 In 1972 , Walter <unk> and his team at the University of <unk> were the first to determine the sequence of a gene : the gene for <unk> <unk> coat protein . The subsequent development of chain @-@ termination DNA sequencing in 1977 by Frederick Sanger improved the efficiency of sequencing and turned it into a routine laboratory tool . An automated version of the Sanger method was used in early phases of the Human <unk> Project . 
 The theories developed in the 1930s and 1940s to integrate molecular genetics with <unk> evolution are called the modern evolutionary synthesis , a term introduced by Julian <unk> . <unk> biologists subsequently refined this concept , such as George C. Williams ' gene @-@ centric view of evolution . He proposed an evolutionary concept of the gene as a unit of natural selection with the definition : " that which <unk> and <unk> with <unk> frequency . " In this view , the molecular gene transcribes as a unit , and the evolutionary gene <unk> as a unit . Related ideas emphasizing the <unk> of genes in evolution were popularized by Richard <unk> . 
 The vast majority of living organisms encode their genes in long strands of DNA ( <unk> acid ) . DNA consists of a chain made from four types of nucleotide subunits , each composed of : a five @-@ carbon sugar ( 2 ' <unk> ) , a phosphate group , and one of the four bases <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . 
 Due to the chemical composition of the <unk> residues of the bases , DNA strands have <unk> . One end of a DNA <unk> contains an exposed <unk> group on the <unk> ; this is known as the 3 ' end of the molecule . The other end contains an exposed phosphate group ; this is the 5 ' end . The two strands of a double @-@ helix run in opposite directions . <unk> acid synthesis , including DNA replication and transcription occurs in the 5 ' → 3 ' direction , because new <unk> are added via a <unk> reaction that uses the exposed 3 ' <unk> as a <unk> . 
 The expression of genes encoded in DNA begins by <unk> the gene into RNA , a second type of nucleic acid that is very similar to DNA , but whose monomers contain the sugar <unk> rather than <unk> . RNA also contains the base <unk> in place of <unk> . RNA molecules are less stable than DNA and are typically single @-@ stranded . <unk> that encode proteins are composed of a series of three @-@ nucleotide sequences called codons , which serve as the " words " in the genetic " language " . The genetic code specifies the correspondence during protein translation between codons and amino acids . The genetic code is nearly the same for all known organisms . 
 The total complement of genes in an organism or cell is known as its genome , which may be stored on one or more chromosomes . A chromosome consists of a single , very long DNA helix on which thousands of genes are encoded . The region of the chromosome at which a particular gene is located is called its <unk> . Each <unk> contains one <unk> of a gene ; however , members of a population may have different <unk> at the <unk> , each with a slightly different gene sequence . 
 The majority of eukaryotic genes are stored on a set of large , linear chromosomes . The chromosomes are packed within the nucleus in complex with storage proteins called histones to form a unit called a <unk> . DNA packaged and <unk> in this way is called chromatin . The manner in which DNA is stored on the histones , as well as chemical modifications of the <unk> itself , regulate whether a particular region of DNA is accessible for gene expression . In addition to genes , eukaryotic chromosomes contain sequences involved in ensuring that the DNA is copied without degradation of end regions and sorted into daughter cells during cell division : replication origins , <unk> and the <unk> . <unk> origins are the sequence regions where DNA replication is initiated to make two copies of the chromosome . <unk> are long stretches of repetitive sequence that cap the ends of the linear chromosomes and prevent degradation of coding and regulatory regions during DNA replication . The length of the <unk> decreases each time the genome is replicated and has been implicated in the aging process . The <unk> is required for binding spindle fibres to separate sister chromatids into daughter cells during cell division . 
 <unk> ( bacteria and archaea ) typically store their <unk> on a single large , circular chromosome . Similarly , some eukaryotic organelles contain a remnant circular chromosome with a small number of genes . <unk> sometimes supplement their chromosome with additional small circles of DNA called <unk> , which usually encode only a few genes and are <unk> between individuals . For example , the genes for antibiotic resistance are usually encoded on bacterial <unk> and can be passed between individual cells , even those of different species , via horizontal gene transfer . 
 Whereas the chromosomes of prokaryotes are relatively gene @-@ dense , those of eukaryotes often contain regions of DNA that serve no obvious function . <unk> single @-@ <unk> eukaryotes have relatively small amounts of such DNA , whereas the <unk> of complex multicellular organisms , including humans , contain an absolute majority of DNA without an identified function . This DNA has often been referred to as " junk DNA " . However , more recent analyses suggest that , although protein @-@ coding DNA makes up barely 2 % of the human genome , about 80 % of the bases in the genome may be expressed , so the term " junk DNA " may be a <unk> . 
 The structure of a gene consists of many elements of which the actual protein coding sequence is often only a small part . These include DNA regions that are not transcribed as well as <unk> regions of the RNA . 
 Firstly , flanking the open reading frame , all genes contain a regulatory sequence that is required for their expression . In order to be expressed , genes require a promoter sequence . The promoter is recognized and bound by transcription factors and RNA polymerase to initiate transcription . A gene can have more than one promoter , resulting in messenger <unk> ( mRNA ) that differ in how far they extend in the 5 ' end . <unk> regions have a consensus sequence , however highly transcribed genes have " strong " promoter sequences that bind the transcription machinery well , whereas others have " weak " <unk> that bind poorly and initiate transcription less frequently . <unk> promoter regions are much more complex and difficult to identify than <unk> <unk> . 
 Additionally , genes can have regulatory regions many <unk> upstream or downstream of the open reading frame . These act by binding to transcription factors which then cause the DNA to loop so that the regulatory sequence ( and bound transcription factor ) become close to the RNA polymerase binding site . For example , <unk> increase transcription by binding an <unk> protein which then helps to recruit the RNA polymerase to the promoter ; <unk> <unk> bind <unk> proteins and make the DNA less available for RNA polymerase . 
 The transcribed pre @-@ mRNA contains <unk> regions at both ends which contain a ribosome binding site , <unk> and start and stop codons . In addition , most eukaryotic open reading frames contain <unk> introns which are removed before the exons are translated . The sequences at the ends of the introns , <unk> the <unk> sites to generate the final mature mRNA which <unk> the protein or RNA product . 
 Many <unk> genes are organized into <unk> , with multiple protein @-@ coding sequences that are transcribed as a unit . The products of <unk> genes typically have related functions and are involved in the same regulatory network . 
 <unk> exactly what section of a DNA sequence comprises a gene is difficult . <unk> regions of a gene such as <unk> do not necessarily have to be close to the coding sequence on the linear molecule because the intervening DNA can be looped out to bring the gene and its regulatory region into proximity . Similarly , a gene 's introns can be much larger than its exons . <unk> regions can even be on entirely different chromosomes and operate in trans to allow regulatory regions on one chromosome to come in contact with target genes on another chromosome . 
 Early work in molecular genetics suggested the model that one gene makes one protein . This model has been refined since the discovery of genes that can encode multiple proteins by alternative splicing and coding sequences split in short section across the genome whose <unk> are <unk> by trans @-@ splicing . 
 A broad operational definition is sometimes used to encompass the complexity of these diverse phenomena , where a gene is defined as a union of <unk> sequences encoding a coherent set of potentially overlapping functional products . This definition <unk> genes by their functional products ( proteins or RNA ) rather than their specific DNA <unk> , with regulatory elements classified as gene @-@ associated regions . 
 In all organisms , two steps are required to read the information encoded in a gene 's DNA and produce the protein it specifies . First , the gene 's DNA is transcribed to messenger RNA ( mRNA ) . Second , that mRNA is translated to protein . RNA @-@ coding genes must still go through the first step , but are not translated into protein . The process of producing a biologically functional molecule of either RNA or protein is called gene expression , and the resulting molecule is called a gene product . 
 The nucleotide sequence of a gene 's DNA specifies the amino acid sequence of a protein through the genetic code . <unk> of three <unk> , known as codons , each correspond to a specific amino acid . Additionally , a " start codon " , and three " stop codons " indicate the beginning and end of the protein coding region . There are 64 possible codons ( four possible <unk> at each of three positions , hence 43 possible codons ) and only 20 standard amino acids ; hence the code is redundant and multiple codons can specify the same amino acid . The correspondence between codons and amino acids is nearly universal among all known living organisms . 
 <unk> produces a single @-@ stranded RNA molecule known as messenger RNA , whose nucleotide sequence is complementary to the DNA from which it was transcribed . The mRNA acts as an intermediate between the DNA gene and its final protein product . The gene 's DNA is used as a template to generate a complementary mRNA . The mRNA matches the sequence of the gene 's DNA coding <unk> because it is <unk> as the complement of the template <unk> . <unk> is performed by an enzyme called an RNA polymerase , which reads the template <unk> in the 3 ' to 5 ' direction and <unk> the RNA from 5 ' to 3 ' . To initiate transcription , the polymerase first recognizes and binds a promoter region of the gene . Thus , a major mechanism of gene regulation is the blocking or <unk> the promoter region , either by tight binding by <unk> molecules that physically block the polymerase , or by organizing the DNA so that the promoter region is not accessible . 
 In prokaryotes , transcription occurs in the cytoplasm ; for very long transcripts , translation may begin at the 5 ' end of the RNA while the 3 ' end is still being transcribed . In eukaryotes , transcription occurs in the nucleus , where the cell 's DNA is stored . The RNA molecule produced by the polymerase is known as the primary transcript and undergoes post @-@ transcriptional modifications before being exported to the cytoplasm for translation . One of the modifications performed is the splicing of introns which are sequences in the transcribed region that do not encode protein . Alternative splicing mechanisms can result in mature transcripts from the same gene having different sequences and thus coding for different proteins . This is a major form of regulation in eukaryotic cells and also occurs in some prokaryotes . 
 <unk> is the process by which a mature mRNA molecule is used as a template for <unk> a new protein . <unk> is carried out by ribosomes , large complexes of RNA and protein responsible for carrying out the chemical reactions to add new amino acids to a growing polypeptide chain by the formation of peptide bonds . The genetic code is read three <unk> at a time , in units called codons , via interactions with specialized RNA molecules called transfer RNA ( tRNA ) . Each tRNA has three <unk> bases known as the <unk> that are complementary to the codon it reads on the mRNA . The tRNA is also <unk> attached to the amino acid specified by the complementary codon . When the tRNA binds to its complementary codon in an mRNA <unk> , the ribosome <unk> its amino acid cargo to the new polypeptide chain , which is synthesized from amino terminus to <unk> terminus . During and after synthesis , most new proteins must folds to their active three @-@ dimensional structure before they can carry out their cellular functions . 
 <unk> are regulated so that they are expressed only when the product is needed , since expression draws on limited resources . A cell <unk> its gene expression depending on its external environment ( e.g. available nutrients , temperature and other stresses ) , its internal environment ( e.g. cell division cycle , metabolism , infection status ) , and its specific role if in a multicellular organism . Gene expression can be regulated at any step : from transcriptional initiation , to RNA processing , to post @-@ <unk> modification of the protein . The regulation of <unk> metabolism genes in E. coli ( <unk> <unk> ) was the first such mechanism to be described in 1961 . 
 A typical protein @-@ coding gene is first copied into RNA as an intermediate in the manufacture of the final protein product . In other cases , the RNA molecules are the actual functional products , as in the synthesis of ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA . Some <unk> known as <unk> are capable of enzymatic function , and <unk> has a regulatory role . The DNA sequences from which such <unk> are transcribed are known as non @-@ coding RNA genes . 
 Some viruses store their entire <unk> in the form of RNA , and contain no DNA at all . Because they use RNA to store genes , their cellular hosts may synthesize their proteins as soon as they are infected and without the delay in waiting for transcription . On the other hand , RNA <unk> , such as HIV , require the reverse transcription of their genome from RNA into DNA before their proteins can be synthesized . RNA @-@ mediated epigenetic inheritance has also been observed in plants and very rarely in animals . 
 <unk> inherit their genes from their parents . <unk> organisms simply inherit a complete copy of their parent 's genome . Sexual organisms have two copies of each chromosome because they inherit one complete set from each parent . 
 According to <unk> inheritance , variations in an organism 's phenotype ( observable physical and behavioral characteristics ) are due in part to variations in its <unk> ( particular set of genes ) . Each gene specifies a particular trait with different sequence of a gene ( <unk> ) giving rise to different <unk> . Most eukaryotic organisms ( such as the pea plants <unk> worked on ) have two <unk> for each trait , one inherited from each parent . 
 The growth , development , and reproduction of organisms relies on cell division , or the process by which a single cell divides into two usually identical daughter cells . This requires first making a duplicate copy of every gene in the genome in a process called DNA replication . The copies are made by specialized enzymes known as DNA <unk> , which " read " one <unk> of the double @-@ helical DNA , known as the template <unk> , and synthesize a new complementary <unk> . Because the DNA double helix is held together by base pairing , the sequence of one <unk> completely specifies the sequence of its complement ; hence only one <unk> needs to be read by the enzyme to produce a faithful copy . The process of DNA replication is <unk> ; that is , the copy of the genome inherited by each daughter cell contains one original and one newly synthesized <unk> of DNA . 
 After DNA replication is complete , the cell must physically separate the two copies of the genome and divide into two distinct membrane @-@ bound cells . In prokaryotes ( bacteria and archaea ) this usually occurs via a relatively simple process called binary fission , in which each circular genome <unk> to the cell membrane and is separated into the daughter cells as the membrane <unk> to split the cytoplasm into two membrane @-@ bound portions . <unk> fission is extremely fast compared to the rates of cell division in eukaryotes . <unk> cell division is a more complex process known as the cell cycle ; DNA replication occurs during a phase of this cycle known as S phase , whereas the process of <unk> chromosomes and splitting the cytoplasm occurs during M phase . 
 DNA replication is for the most part extremely accurate , however errors ( mutations ) do occur . The error rate in eukaryotic cells can be as low as 10 − 8 per nucleotide per replication , whereas for some RNA viruses it can be as high as 10 − 3 . This means that each generation , each human genome <unk> 1 – 2 new mutations . Small mutations can be caused by DNA replication and the aftermath of DNA damage and include point mutations in which a single base is altered and <unk> mutations in which a single base is inserted or deleted . Either of these mutations can change the gene by <unk> ( change a codon to encode a different amino acid ) or nonsense ( a premature stop codon ) . Larger mutations can be caused by errors in <unk> to cause chromosomal abnormalities including the <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> of large sections of a chromosome . Additionally , the DNA repair mechanisms that normally revert mutations can introduce errors when repairing the physical damage to the molecule is more important than restoring an exact copy , for example when repairing double @-@ <unk> breaks . 
 Most mutations within genes are neutral , having no effect on the organism 's phenotype ( silent mutations ) . Some mutations do not change the amino acid sequence because multiple codons encode the same amino acid ( synonymous mutations ) . Other mutations can be neutral if they lead to amino acid sequence changes , but the protein still functions similarly with the new amino acid ( e.g. conservative mutations ) . Many mutations , however , are <unk> or even lethal , and are removed from populations by natural selection . Genetic disorders are the result of <unk> mutations and can be due to spontaneous <unk> in the affected individual , or can be inherited . Finally , a small fraction of mutations are beneficial , improving the organism 's fitness and are extremely important for evolution , since their directional selection leads to adaptive evolution . 
 <unk> with a most recent common ancestor , and thus a shared evolutionary ancestry , are known as <unk> . These genes appear either from gene <unk> within an organism 's genome , where they are known as <unk> genes , or are the result of divergence of the genes after a <unk> event , where they are known as <unk> genes , and often perform the same or similar functions in related organisms . It is often assumed that the functions of <unk> genes are more similar than those of <unk> genes , although the difference is minimal . 
 The relationship between genes can be measured by comparing the sequence alignment of their DNA . The degree of sequence similarity between <unk> genes is called <unk> sequence . Most changes to a gene 's sequence do not affect its function and so genes accumulate mutations over time by neutral molecular evolution . Additionally , any selection on a gene will cause its sequence to <unk> at a different rate . <unk> under stabilizing selection are constrained and so change more slowly whereas genes under directional selection change sequence more rapidly . The sequence differences between genes can be used for phylogenetic analyses to study how those genes have evolved and how the organisms they come from are related . 
 The most common source of new genes in eukaryotic lineages is gene <unk> , which creates copy number variation of an existing gene in the genome . The resulting genes ( <unk> ) may then <unk> in sequence and in function . <unk> of genes formed in this way comprise a gene family . Gene <unk> and losses within a family are common and represent a major source of evolutionary biodiversity . Sometimes , gene <unk> may result in a <unk> copy of a gene , or a functional copy may be subject to mutations that result in loss of function ; such <unk> genes are called <unk> . 
 De <unk> or " <unk> " genes , whose sequence shows no similarity to existing genes , are extremely rare . Estimates of the number of de <unk> genes in the human genome range from 18 to 60 . Such genes are typically shorter and simpler in structure than most eukaryotic genes , with few if any introns . Two primary sources of <unk> protein @-@ coding genes are gene <unk> followed by extremely rapid sequence change , such that the original relationship is undetectable by sequence comparisons , and formation through <unk> of " cryptic " transcription start sites that introduce a new open reading frame in a region of the genome that did not previously code for a protein . 
 <unk> gene transfer refers to the transfer of genetic material through a mechanism other than reproduction . This mechanism is a common source of new genes in prokaryotes , sometimes thought to contribute more to genetic variation than gene <unk> . It is a common means of spreading antibiotic resistance , <unk> , and adaptive metabolic functions . Although horizontal gene transfer is rare in eukaryotes , likely examples have been identified of <unk> and <unk> <unk> containing genes of bacterial origin . 
 The genome is the total genetic material of an organism and includes both the genes and non @-@ coding sequences . 
 The genome size , and the number of genes it <unk> varies widely between organisms . The smallest <unk> occur in viruses ( which can have as few as 2 protein @-@ coding genes ) , and <unk> ( which act as a single non @-@ coding RNA gene ) . Conversely , plants can have extremely large <unk> , with rice containing > 46 @,@ 000 protein @-@ coding genes . The total number of protein @-@ coding genes ( the Earth 's <unk> ) is estimated to be 5 million sequences . 
 Although the number of base @-@ pairs of DNA in the human genome has been known since the 1960s , the estimated number of genes has changed over time as definitions of genes , and methods of detecting them have been refined . Initial theoretical predictions of the number of human genes were as high as 2 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 . Early experimental measures indicated there to be 50 @,@ 000 – 100 @,@ 000 transcribed genes ( expressed sequence <unk> ) . Subsequently , the sequencing in the Human <unk> Project indicated that many of these transcripts were alternative variants of the same genes , and the total number of protein @-@ coding genes was revised down to ~ 20 @,@ 000 with 13 genes encoded on the mitochondrial genome . Of the human genome , only 1 – 2 % consists of protein @-@ coding genes , with the remainder being ' <unk> ' DNA such as introns , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> organism has all his genes in all cells of his body but it is not important that every gene must function in every cell . 
 Essential genes are the set of genes thought to be critical for an organism 's survival . This definition assumes the abundant availability of all relevant nutrients and the absence of environmental stress . Only a small portion of an organism 's genes are essential . In bacteria , an estimated 250 – 400 genes are essential for <unk> coli and <unk> <unk> , which is less than 10 % of their genes . Half of these genes are <unk> in both organisms and are largely involved in protein synthesis . In the budding yeast <unk> <unk> the number of essential genes is slightly higher , at 1000 genes ( ~ 20 % of their genes ) . Although the number is more difficult to measure in higher eukaryotes , mice and humans are estimated to have around 2000 essential genes ( ~ 10 % of their genes ) . The synthetic organism , <unk> 3 , has a minimal genome of 473 essential genes and quasi @-@ essential genes ( necessary for fast growth ) , although 149 have unknown function . 
 Essential genes include <unk> genes ( critical for basic cell functions ) as well as genes that are expressed at different times in the organisms development or life cycle . <unk> genes are used as experimental controls when <unk> gene expression , since they are <unk> expressed at a relatively constant level . 
 Gene nomenclature has been established by the <unk> Gene Nomenclature Committee ( <unk> ) for each known human gene in the form of an approved gene name and symbol ( short @-@ form abbreviation ) , which can be accessed through a database maintained by <unk> . <unk> are chosen to be unique , and each gene has only one symbol ( although approved symbols sometimes change ) . <unk> are <unk> kept consistent with other members of a gene family and with <unk> in other species , particularly the mouse due to its role as a common model organism . 
 Genetic engineering is the modification of an organism 's genome through <unk> . Since the 1970s , a variety of techniques have been developed to specifically add , remove and edit genes in an organism . Recently developed genome engineering techniques use engineered <unk> enzymes to create targeted DNA repair in a chromosome to either disrupt or edit a gene when the break is repaired . The related term synthetic biology is sometimes used to refer to extensive genetic engineering of an organism . 
 Genetic engineering is now a routine research tool with model organisms . For example , genes are easily added to bacteria and lineages of knockout mice with a specific gene 's function disrupted are used to investigate that gene 's function . Many organisms have been genetically modified for applications in agriculture , industrial <unk> , and medicine . 
 For multicellular organisms , typically the embryo is engineered which grows into the adult genetically modified organism . However , the <unk> of cells in an adult organism can be edited using gene therapy techniques to treat genetic diseases . 
 Ancient , medieval and Renaissance astronomers and philosophers developed many different theories about the dynamics of the celestial spheres . They explained the motions of the various <unk> spheres in terms of the materials of which they were made , external <unk> such as celestial <unk> , and internal <unk> such as motive souls or impressed forces . Most of these models were <unk> , although a few of them incorporated <unk> analyses that related speed , motive force and resistance . 
 In his Planetary <unk> , Ptolemy ( <unk> – 168 ) rejected the <unk> concept of an external prime <unk> , maintaining instead that the planets have souls and move themselves with a voluntary motion . Each planet sends out motive emissions that direct its own motion and the motions of the <unk> and <unk> that make up its system , just as a bird sends out emissions to its nerves that direct the motions of its feet and wings . 
 John <unk> ( 490 – 570 ) considered that the heavens were made of fire , not of <unk> , yet maintained that circular motion is one of the two natural motions of fire . In a theological work , On the Creation of the World ( De <unk> <unk> ) , he denied that the heavens are moved by either a soul or by angels , proposing that " it is not impossible that God , who created all these things , imparted a motive force to the Moon , the Sun , and other stars – just as the inclination to heavy and light bodies , and the movements due to the internal soul to all living beings – in order that the angels do not move them by force . " This is interpreted as an application of the concept of <unk> to the motion of the celestial spheres . In an earlier commentary on <unk> 's Physics , <unk> compared the innate power or nature that accounts for the rotation of the heavens to the innate power or nature that accounts for the fall of rocks . 
 An interpreter of <unk> from Muslim Spain , al @-@ <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , proposed a radical transformation of astronomy that did away with <unk> and <unk> , in which the celestial spheres were driven by a single <unk> <unk> at the periphery of the universe . The spheres thus moved with a " natural nonviolent motion " . The <unk> 's power diminished with increasing distance from the periphery so that the lower spheres <unk> behind in their daily motion around the Earth ; this power reached even as far as the sphere of water , producing the tides . 
 More influential for later Christian thinkers were the teachings of <unk> ( 1126 – <unk> ) , who agreed with <unk> that the <unk> and souls combine to move the spheres but rejected his concept of <unk> . Considering how the soul acts , he maintained that the soul moves its sphere without effort , for the celestial material has no tendency to a contrary motion . 
 Later in the century , a commentator on the Islamic theologian <unk> al @-@ Din al @-@ <unk> ( 1281 – <unk> ) rejected non @-@ religious science and astronomy , following the Ash 'ari doctrine of <unk> , which maintained that all physical effects were caused directly by God 's will rather than by natural causes . He maintained that the celestial spheres were " imaginary things " and " more tenuous than a spider 's web " . 
 In the Early Middle Ages , <unk> 's picture of the heavens was dominant among European philosophers , which led Christian thinkers to question the role and nature of the world @-@ soul . With the recovery of <unk> 's works in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries , <unk> 's views <unk> the earlier <unk> , and a new set of questions regarding the relationships of the <unk> <unk> to the spheres and to God emerged . 
 Robert <unk> ( c . 1215 – 1279 ) discussed three alternative explanations of the motions of the celestial spheres , rejecting the views that celestial bodies are animated and are moved by their own spirits or souls , or that the celestial bodies are moved by <unk> spirits , which govern and move them . He maintained , instead , that " celestial bodies are moved by their own natural <unk> similar to weight " . Just as heavy bodies are naturally moved by their own weight , which is an intrinsic active principle , so the celestial bodies are naturally moved by a similar intrinsic principle . Since the heavens are spherical , the only motion that could be natural to them is rotation . <unk> 's idea had been earlier held by another Oxford scholar , John <unk> ( c . 1175 – <unk> ) . 
 In two slightly different discussions , John <unk> ( <unk> – <unk> ) suggested that when God created the celestial spheres , he began to move them , impressing in them a circular <unk> that would be neither corrupted nor diminished , since there was neither an inclination to other movements nor any resistance in the celestial region . He noted that this would allow God to rest on the seventh day , but he left the matter to be resolved by the theologians . 
 Nicole <unk> ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) explained the motion of the spheres in traditional terms of the action of <unk> but noted that , contrary to <unk> , some <unk> are moved ; for example , the intelligence that moves the Moon 's <unk> shares the motion of the lunar <unk> in which the <unk> is embedded . He related the spheres ' motions to the proportion of motive power to resistance that was impressed in each sphere when God created the heavens . In discussing the relation of the moving power of the intelligence , the resistance of the sphere , and the circular velocity , he said " this ratio ought not to be called a ratio of force to resistance except by analogy , because an intelligence moves by will alone ... and the heavens do not resist it . " 
 According to Grant , except for <unk> , scholastic thinkers did not consider the force @-@ resistance model to be properly applicable to the motion of celestial bodies , although some , such as <unk> <unk> , thought <unk> in terms of force and resistance . By the end of the Middle Ages it was the common opinion among philosophers that the celestial bodies were moved by external <unk> , or angels , and not by some kind of an internal <unk> . 
 Although <unk> <unk> ( <unk> – <unk> ) transformed Ptolemaic astronomy and <unk> <unk> by moving the Earth from the center of the universe , he retained both the traditional model of the celestial spheres and the medieval <unk> views of the causes of its motion . <unk> follows <unk> to maintain that circular motion is natural to the form of a sphere . However , he also appears to have accepted the traditional philosophical belief that the spheres are moved by an external <unk> . 
 Johannes Kepler 's ( <unk> – 1630 ) <unk> eliminated the celestial spheres , but he held that the planets were moved both by an external motive power , which he located in the Sun , and a motive soul associated with each planet . In an early manuscript discussing the motion of Mars , Kepler considered the Sun to cause the circular motion of the planet . He then attributed the inward and outward motion of the planet , which transforms its overall motion from circular to oval , to a moving soul in the planet since the motion is " not a natural motion , but more of an <unk> one " . In various writings , Kepler often attributed a kind of intelligence to the <unk> motive faculties associated with the stars . 
 In the aftermath of <unk> the planets came to be seen as bodies moving freely through a very subtle <unk> medium . Although many <unk> continued to maintain that <unk> were the celestial <unk> , they now associated the <unk> with the planets themselves , rather than with the celestial spheres . 
 <unk> studied graphic design at Iowa State University and graduated in 2008 . He has described his aesthetic as " simple and elegant " , and has said about his practice that he is not good at character design and that he prefers to work with vector file formats in <unk> <unk> so that the images can work at all resolutions . <unk> also feels that creativity is a skill that is cultivated and not <unk> . He has been influenced by his lifelong experience playing video games , and his favorite game is <unk> 's Gate II : Shadows of <unk> . His writings on the lifestyle required for indie development have been noted by games journalists . <unk> was named among Forbes ' 2014 " 30 under 30 " in the games industry . 
 <unk> met Mike <unk> in an experimental video game development class they took together at Iowa State University . <unk> had attempted to help <unk> with a project , but quit after drawing a few aliens . They met again as <unk> at the university 's Virtual Reality Application Center during <unk> 's final year of college . Upon discovering their close interests , they began to work on an <unk> Flash game named <unk> while they completed college . So as to make money while they worked on the game , they founded <unk> Games at the university 's Research Park around May 2007 . They decided to stay in Ames , Iowa due to its financial feasibility and local connections , but two other team members ( friends from Iowa State ) lived farther away . They saw Flash games as an easy entry point into full @-@ time self @-@ employment , but planned to eventually work on console platforms such as <unk> . 
 Their first game as <unk> was the sport @-@ inspired <unk> , where the player 's finger draws the ground for the on @-@ screen <unk> to pass through a level filled with gates , tunnels , and walls . It was designed as a Flash game , which set the limitations for its mechanics . The game concept came from a <unk> session about parallax scrolling , and was revised in fits of creativity . They paired the parallax scrolling with speed and began to prototype . <unk> saved the <unk> 's character design for last since he felt it was his weakest area . <unk> then decided to develop for iOS in addition to Flash , and to release both versions simultaneously . It was released simultaneously for <unk> ( Flash ) and iOS on August 29 , 2010 . <unk> became their first game to receive public appreciation . The iOS version made around $ 70 @,@ 000 in its first two months ( as compared to $ 15 @,@ 000 from the Flash release ) , which gave them enough stability to branch out into non @-@ Flash platforms . 
 <unk> was released for <unk> on August 9 , 2012 . They had decided to release the game as an <unk> non @-@ <unk> free @-@ to @-@ play game , with a free base game and in @-@ <unk> purchases for the extended content . Not as many players paid for the content as expected . This was due , in part , to the players ' difficulty in finding the purchase function . The game had been downloaded 200 @,@ 000 times in its August 2012 launch week and was briefly ranked near the top of an iTunes top downloads ranking , though it did not break the top 200 grossing chart . 
 Upon finishing his role as artist on <unk> , <unk> wanted to experiment with game programming by designing his own game . He developed Hundreds from an idea he had while staring at a ceiling , where he imagined a circle growing without overlapping another when growing . He found this to be a good core game concept and based the game around " patience and persistence " . The game 's style inadvertently borrowed from his first year in art school , where <unk> composed in black , white , and red so as to focus on composition rather than color . While <unk> 's design style is " simple and elegant " , the game 's <unk> was also functional due to his inexperience with programming . The code was " brute forced " and written in a single file . He finished Hundreds as a Flash game in 2010 , but when Flash sites were not interested in purchasing it , <unk> chose to open source the code ( partly with the intent to spur " non @-@ <unk> " to try coding , as he had ) . This version is available online at <unk> . 
 In Hundreds , players touch circles to make them grow without overlapping . There are 100 puzzles that increase in complexity . The Flash version was much simpler in design , and added circles <unk> as the game progressed . The iOS version added a new gameplay mode and a narrative element based on <unk> and codes , and was released on January 7 , 2013 for <unk> and <unk> , and later for <unk> . It was nominated for several Independent Games Festival awards , and The Atlantic critic Ian <unk> wrote that the game functioned like a design object , a feat unique for the video game medium . 
 The last parts of <unk> <unk> assembled smoothly and it was released March 14 , 2013 for iOS and later that year for <unk> . It was well received at launch with " near @-@ universal perfect scores " and won both a 2013 Apple Design Award and Apple 's <unk> game of the year . While IGN 's Justin Davis thought the game 's levels could have been more differentiated in theme and art style , he found the " almost <unk> design ... absolutely gorgeous " . Welsh of Eurogamer agreed that <unk> 's art was " <unk> cool " and reflected a " retro and <unk> " indie gaming trend without <unk> the gameplay . 
 When returning to the fundamental and original game concept — pairing tiles as <unk> of three — the developers felt their experiments informed their final game development decisions . The theme of individual tile personalities extended to the final version , as tiles have faces and express emotions when paired . For example , the 384 tile has a pirate personality with a large tooth and a pirate <unk> . Of the development process , <unk> called it " tough and frustrating and sometimes hard to see if it was worth it " . It was released for iOS on February 6 , 2014 and later ported to <unk> , with an Xbox One version announced as in development . The game received what video game review score aggregator Metacritic described as " universal acclaim " . Eurogamer and <unk> awarded the game perfect scores , with the latter calling <unk> " about as close as it gets to a perfect mobile game " . Re / code reported that it " dominated " the chart in the following weeks and became one of the 25 highest grossing <unk> on the <unk> Store . It later won a 2014 Apple Design Award . 
 After <unk> 's 2012 release , <unk> and <unk> planned a celebratory road trip to a game jam in Victoria , British Columbia . The game did not fare as expected , so <unk> used the two @-@ day jam to create the core mirror reflection mechanics of what would become <unk> , though it would take two years of sporadic work to <unk> the remainder of the game . In <unk> , the player monitors phone calls as part of a government surveillance program to find public threats . The story is told through a series of reflection puzzles wherein the player <unk> the screen to reflect a beam around a room to its intended destination . 
 As of July 2015 , <unk> is <unk> with Benedict <unk> on <unk> , a computer game based on arcade game Ice Cold Beer wherein the player uses four keyboard keys to navigate a seed around holes . The game 's development is part of a Cards Against <unk> game incubation program . <unk> is planned for release in 2015 . 
 " Vincent and the Doctor " is the tenth episode in the fifth series of British science fiction television series Doctor Who , first broadcast on BBC One on 5 June 2010 . It was written by Richard Curtis and directed by Jonny Campbell and featured an <unk> guest appearance from actor Bill <unk> . 
 Curtis , inspired by the fact that Van <unk> never knew he would be famous , had the idea for an episode centred on him . He left the script open to criticism from the crew and made many revisions as a result . Curtis wanted to portray Van <unk> <unk> , rather than being cruel by writing jokes about his madness . The episode was filmed in <unk> , Croatia and many of the sets were modelled after Van <unk> paintings . The episode was watched by 6 @.@ 76 million viewers on BBC One and BBC HD . Reception to the episode varied , ranging from very positive to mixed to very negative . While the amount of emotion in the episode was debated over , most reviewers agreed that the <unk> was not a threatening monster while <unk> 's performance as Van <unk> was immensely praised . 
 The Doctor has taken Amy to the Musée d <unk> in Paris , where they admire the work of the post @-@ <unk> painter Vincent van <unk> . The Doctor discovers a seemingly alien figure in a window of the painting The Church at <unk> , and decides they must travel back in time to speak to Vincent around when he painted the painting . In 1890 , they find Vincent at a cafe in <unk> , a lonely man with a bad reputation . Vincent opens up when he notices Amy , sensing a loss she herself is not aware of . Outside the cafe a young girl is murdered , when the trio go out to see what happened they are <unk> by locals who blame Vincent 's <unk> for the killing . The Doctor and Amy talk Vincent into letting them stay the night and they return to his home . 
 That evening , Vincent confesses that his works have little value to anyone else . He believes the universe is filled with wonders that he must paint , and that he can " hear the colours " . Amy goes outside and is attacked by a beast that only Vincent is able to see . He sketches it for the Doctor , who identifies it as a <unk> . Knowing the beast will appear when Vincent paints the nearby church the next evening , the Doctor and Amy plan to join him . The next morning , Vincent becomes distraught after being told that The Doctor and Amy won 't be staying long . Vincent <unk> himself in his bedroom , saying that everyone leaves him in the end . The Doctor and Amy set out to capture the beast alone , but Vincent soon joins them eager to help . He <unk> to Amy that if she can " soldier on , then so can Vincent van <unk> " . 
 Vincent begins creating the painting of the church and soon spots the beast inside . The Doctor demands that Amy stay back as he enters the church alone , but she and Vincent both agree they should help the Doctor . Vincent is able to save the Doctor and Amy , describing the beast 's actions as they hide in the <unk> . The Doctor soon realises from Vincent 's description that the beast is blind , the likely reason it was abandoned on Earth . The beast is <unk> on Vincent 's <unk> when it tries to <unk> at the artist . The Doctor attempts to <unk> the dying creature while Vincent <unk> with its pain . After the creature dies , the three return outside the church and Vincent describes the night sky as he <unk> it . 
 The next day , the Doctor and Amy prepare to leave . Vincent asks Amy to return and marry him should she leave the Doctor . The Doctor offers to show him something . The Doctor and Amy take Vincent in the <unk> to the present and the Van <unk> exhibit at the Musée d <unk> . Vincent is stunned at the display and becomes emotionally overwhelmed when he <unk> art curator Dr. Black ( Bill <unk> ) say that Van <unk> was " the greatest painter of them all " and " one of the greatest men who ever lived " . They return an emotionally changed Vincent to the past and say their final <unk> . As the Doctor and Amy return to the present , Amy is confident that there will be hundreds of new paintings by Vincent waiting for them . She is crushed to learn that Vincent still committed suicide weeks after their adventure , at the age of 37 . The Doctor explains that life is a mixture of bad and good , and while their brief encounter with Vincent couldn 't <unk> all of the bad , they added some good to his life . The evidence is in Vincent 's displayed works : the face no longer appears in The Church , and now <unk> with 12 Sunflowers bears the inscription , " For Amy " . 
 <unk> of the First and Second Doctors are displayed on the Doctor 's mirror device and <unk> from the <unk> ' typewriter . The episode presents these trips as the Doctor 's compensation to Amy for her fiancé Rory Williams ' death in the previous episode , which Amy herself does not remember since Rory was consumed by a crack in the universe and thus erased from time . Van <unk> is able to sense Amy 's sadness at Rory 's death , and the Doctor later accidentally addresses Amy and Vincent as Amy and Rory , respectively . 
 Writer Richard Curtis was previously executive producer on the Doctor Who spoof The Curse of <unk> Death , a one @-@ off comedy special written for Comic Relief by current show @-@ runner Steven Moffat . Based on this experience , Moffat asked Curtis to write an episode of Doctor Who . Curtis had enjoyed the show 's historical episodes and felt comfortable writing one . He had the idea of a story centred on Van <unk> for " a long while " and was particularly interested in the fact Van <unk> never knew he would be famous , as well as his inspirational story . Curtis was also interested in depression and the price paid for it . He wanted to convey that the Doctor could rewrite time , but Van <unk> 's " demons " were out of his reach . Moffat was " enthusiastic " about the story idea . 
 Curtis asked Moffat to <unk> " anything and everything " and later said he was very honest . Executive producer Piers <unk> and director Jonny Campbell also critiqued the script . Moffat told Curtis that it needed to " start quicker " and that the meeting with the Doctor and Vincent was " dull " and needed to be something " cute " like Curtis had done in his films . He also noted that the Doctor did not talk as much as Curtis had written and recommended Curtis watch some episodes to see he was " rather efficient in the way that he talked " . Curtis enjoyed the experience , commenting that it was " fun " to work within boundaries rather than doing it all himself . After seeing a read @-@ through performed by leads Matt Smith and Karen <unk> , Curtis made more changes . He commented that it was easy to write for them as they were " so delightful and modern and relaxed " . Curtis 's original title for the episode was " Eyes that See the Darkness " , but he said this was vetoed . 
 Curtis wanted to write for Doctor Who because he thought it would be " something my kids would like . " When writing " Vincent and the Doctor " , Curtis put up prints of Van <unk> paintings around the house as well as a board with index cards outlining the plot . His children helped him come up with some ideas . <unk> commented that the story had a different style and approach and was more character @-@ driven . Though it was a subject he knew " quite a lot " about , he still read a 200 @-@ page biography of Van <unk> , which was more research than he normally would have done if working on other projects ; he took Van <unk> very seriously . As such , he wanted to be " <unk> rather than cruel " and refused to write any jokes about Van <unk> 's ears after he famously cut one of them off . However , he did incorporate other humour as he naturally wanted to " try to make things funny " . 
 Scenes set in Provence were filmed on location in <unk> , Croatia in the same production block as " The <unk> of Venice " , which sees <unk> depicting 16th @-@ century Venice . Filming took place around November 2009 . The National Museum Cardiff doubled for the interior of the Musée d <unk> . Some of the sets were intended to reference paintings , such as Van <unk> 's bedroom . One such set was the café where the Doctor and Amy first meet Van <unk> , which was modelled after the painting Cafe <unk> at Night . This proved challenging for the art department , who extensively looked for a suitable building in Croatia to use . Once they found the one they wanted , they had to redesign it to look like the painting ; this involved putting an <unk> up , changing the windows , and adding a platform with tables and chairs . The song played during the ending scene is " <unk> " by the British rock band <unk> . 
 " Vincent and the Doctor " was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC One and <unk> on BBC HD on 5 June 2010 . Initial overnight ratings showed that the episode was watched by 5 million , the second rated show of the day and the first on BBC One . Final consolidated ratings rose to 6 @.@ 76 million , with 6 @.@ 29 on BBC One and a further 0 @.@ 47 on BBC HD . It was the second most watched programme on BBC One and the highest on BBC HD . It was given an <unk> Index of 86 , considered " excellent " . 
 After the original broadcast , viewers were offered a <unk> if they had been affected by the issues raised in the programme . " Vincent and the Doctor " was released in Region 2 on DVD and Blu @-@ ray on 6 September 2010 with " The <unk> " , " The <unk> <unk> " and " The Big Bang " . It was then re @-@ released as part of the Complete Fifth Series <unk> on 8 November 2010 . 
 One of the most negative reviews came from Gavin Fuller in The Telegraph , who criticised it as a " bland , <unk> episode that , once it set up what was a decent enough premise ... completely failed to run with it " . He compared it <unk> with the third series episode " The Shakespeare Code " in being centred round a historical " tormented artist " but wrote that it lacked that episode 's " narrative drive " , with " a serious plot hole " in Van <unk> 's ability to see the creature and that the <unk> was " the most pointless monsters ever to appear in the series ' long history " . He also criticised Smith 's Doctor and wrote that Van <unk> still committing suicide despite the trip to the <unk> was " nonsensical " . He did , however , praise " the Doctor 's <unk> about good things and bad things " ( though Sam <unk> criticised this speech in The Guardian ) and was grateful that Curtis " avoided turning the Doctor into a <unk> Hugh Grant character from his <unk> " , concluding however " he did little else right and a crushing disappointment was the result " . 
 " Vincent and the Doctor " was nominated for the Bradbury Award for Outstanding Dramatic Presentation in the 2010 Nebula Awards and the 2011 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation ( Short Form ) . It lost both of these ; the Bradbury to the film <unk> and the Hugo to the series finale " The <unk> <unk> " / " The Big Bang " . In Canada 's <unk> Awards , <unk> was nominated ( alongside Smith ) for Best Actor and Curtis for Best <unk> ; <unk> came in sixth with 10 % of the votes and Curtis came in second , losing out to Christopher Nolan 's <unk> by one percent of the vote . 
 In particle physics , quantum <unk> ( <unk> ) is the <unk> quantum field theory of <unk> . In essence , it describes how light and matter interact and is the first theory where full agreement between quantum mechanics and special relativity is achieved . <unk> <unk> describes all phenomena involving electrically charged particles interacting by means of exchange of photons and represents the quantum counterpart of classical <unk> giving a complete account of matter and light interaction . 
 In technical terms , <unk> can be described as a <unk> theory of the electromagnetic quantum vacuum . Richard Feynman called it " the jewel of physics " for its extremely accurate predictions of quantities like the <unk> magnetic moment of the electron and the Lamb shift of the energy levels of hydrogen . 
 The first formulation of a quantum theory describing radiation and matter interaction is attributed to British scientist Paul <unk> , who ( during the 1920s ) was able to <unk> the coefficient of spontaneous emission of an atom . 
 <unk> with the theory increased through the end of 1940 . <unk> in <unk> technology made it possible to take more precise measurements of the shift of the levels of a hydrogen atom , now known as the Lamb shift and magnetic moment of the electron . These experiments unequivocally exposed discrepancies which the theory was unable to explain . 
 A first indication of a possible way out was given by Hans Bethe . In 1947 , while he was traveling by train to reach <unk> from New York , after giving a talk at the conference at <unk> Island on the subject , Bethe completed the first non @-@ <unk> computation of the shift of the lines of the hydrogen atom as measured by Lamb and <unk> . Despite the limitations of the computation , agreement was excellent . The idea was simply to attach <unk> to corrections of mass and charge that were actually fixed to a finite value by experiments . In this way , the <unk> get absorbed in those <unk> and yield a finite result in good agreement with experiments . This procedure was named <unk> . 
 Near the end of his life , Richard P. Feynman gave a series of lectures on <unk> intended for the lay public . These lectures were transcribed and published as Feynman ( 1985 ) , <unk> : The strange theory of light and matter , a classic non @-@ mathematical <unk> of <unk> from the point of view articulated below . 
 These actions are represented in a form of visual <unk> by the three basic elements of Feynman <unk> : a wavy line for the <unk> , a straight line for the electron and a junction of two straight lines and a wavy one for a vertex representing emission or absorption of a <unk> by an electron . These can all be seen in the adjacent diagram . 
 It is important not to over @-@ interpret these <unk> . Nothing is implied about how a particle gets from one point to another . The <unk> do not imply that the particles are moving in straight or curved lines . They do not imply that the particles are moving with fixed speeds . The fact that the <unk> is often represented , by convention , by a wavy line and not a straight one does not imply that it is thought that it is more <unk> than is an electron . The images are just symbols to represent the actions above : photons and electrons do , somehow , move from point to point and electrons , somehow , emit and absorb photons . We do not know how these things happen , but the theory tells us about the <unk> of these things happening . 
 <unk> is based on the assumption that complex interactions of many electrons and photons can be represented by fitting together a suitable collection of the above three building blocks , and then using the probability <unk> to calculate the probability of any such complex interaction . It turns out that the basic idea of <unk> can be communicated while making the assumption that the square of the total of the probability <unk> mentioned above ( P ( A to B ) , E ( A to B ) and ' <unk> ' ) acts just like our everyday probability . ( A <unk> made in Feynman 's book . ) Later on , this will be corrected to include specifically quantum @-@ style mathematics , following Feynman . 
 The basic rules of probability <unk> that will be used are that a ) if an event can happen in a variety of different ways then its probability <unk> is the sum of the probability <unk> of the possible ways and b ) if a process involves a number of independent sub @-@ processes then its probability <unk> is the product of the component probability <unk> . 
 <unk> we start with one electron at a certain place and time ( this place and time being given the arbitrary label A ) and a <unk> at another place and time ( given the label B ) . A typical question from a physical standpoint is : ' What is the probability of finding an electron at C ( another place and a later time ) and a <unk> at D ( yet another place and time ) ? ' . The simplest process to achieve this end is for the electron to move from A to C ( an elementary action ) and for the <unk> to move from B to D ( another elementary action ) . From a knowledge of the probability <unk> of each of these sub @-@ processes – E ( A to C ) and P ( B to D ) – then we would expect to calculate the probability <unk> of both happening together by <unk> them , using rule b ) above . This gives a simple estimated overall probability <unk> , which is <unk> to give an estimated probability . 
 There are an infinite number of other intermediate processes in which more and more photons are absorbed and / or emitted . For each of these possibilities there is a Feynman diagram describing it . This implies a complex computation for the resulting probability <unk> , but provided it is the case that the more complicated the diagram the less it contributes to the result , it is only a matter of time and effort to find as accurate an answer as one wants to the original question . This is the basic approach of <unk> . To calculate the probability of any interactive process between electrons and photons it is a matter of first noting , with Feynman <unk> , all the possible ways in which the process can be constructed from the three basic elements . Each diagram involves some calculation involving definite rules to find the associated probability <unk> . 
 That basic scaffolding remains when one moves to a quantum description but some conceptual changes are needed . One is that whereas we might expect in our everyday life that there would be some constraints on the points to which a particle can move , that is not true in full quantum <unk> . There is a possibility of an electron at A , or a <unk> at B , moving as a basic action to any other place and time in the universe . That includes places that could only be reached at speeds greater than that of light and also earlier times . ( An electron moving backwards in time can be viewed as a positron moving forward in time . ) 
 <unk> mechanics introduces an important change in the way <unk> are computed . <unk> are still represented by the usual real numbers we use for <unk> in our everyday world , but <unk> are computed as the square of probability <unk> . <unk> <unk> are complex numbers . 
 Feynman avoids exposing the reader to the mathematics of complex numbers by using a simple but accurate representation of them as arrows on a piece of paper or screen . ( These must not be confused with the arrows of Feynman <unk> which are actually simplified representations in two dimensions of a relationship between points in three dimensions of space and one of time . ) The <unk> arrows are fundamental to the description of the world given by quantum theory . No satisfactory reason has been given for why they are needed . But <unk> we have to accept that they are an essential part of our description of all quantum phenomena . They are related to our everyday ideas of probability by the simple rule that the probability of an event is the square of the length of the corresponding <unk> arrow . So , for a given process , if two probability <unk> , v and w , are involved , the probability of the process will be given either by 
 The rules as regards adding or <unk> , however , are the same as above . But where you would expect to add or <unk> <unk> , instead you add or <unk> probability <unk> that now are complex numbers . 
 <unk> and <unk> are familiar operations in the theory of complex numbers and are given in the figures . The sum is found as follows . Let the start of the second arrow be at the end of the first . The sum is then a third arrow that goes directly from the start of the first to the end of the second . The product of two arrows is an arrow whose length is the product of the two lengths . The direction of the product is found by adding the angles that each of the two have been turned through relative to a reference direction : that gives the angle that the product is turned relative to the reference direction . 
 That change , from <unk> to probability <unk> , <unk> the mathematics without changing the basic approach . But that change is still not quite enough because it fails to take into account the fact that both photons and electrons can be polarized , which is to say that their orientations in space and time have to be taken into account . Therefore , P ( A to B ) actually consists of 16 complex numbers , or probability <unk> arrows . There are also some minor changes to do with the quantity " <unk> " , which may have to be rotated by a multiple of 90 ° for some <unk> , which is only of interest for the detailed <unk> . 
 Associated with the fact that the electron can be polarized is another small necessary detail which is connected with the fact that an electron is a <unk> and <unk> Fermi – <unk> statistics . The basic rule is that if we have the probability <unk> for a given complex process involving more than one electron , then when we include ( as we always must ) the complementary Feynman diagram in which we just exchange two electron events , the resulting <unk> is the reverse – the negative – of the first . The simplest case would be two electrons starting at A and B ending at C and D. The <unk> would be calculated as the " difference " , E ( A to D ) × E ( B to C ) − E ( A to C ) × E ( B to D ) , where we would expect , from our everyday idea of <unk> , that it would be a sum . 
 Finally , one has to <unk> P ( A to B ) and E ( C to D ) corresponding to the probability <unk> for the <unk> and the electron respectively . These are essentially the solutions of the <unk> <unk> which describes the behavior of the electron 's probability <unk> and the Klein – Gordon equation which describes the behavior of the <unk> 's probability <unk> . These are called Feynman <unk> . The translation to a <unk> commonly used in the standard literature is as follows : 
 where a <unk> symbol such as <formula> stands for the four real numbers which give the time and position in three dimensions of the point labeled A. 
 A problem arose historically which held up progress for twenty years : although we start with the assumption of three basic " simple " actions , the rules of the game say that if we want to calculate the probability <unk> for an electron to get from A to B we must take into account all the possible ways : all possible Feynman <unk> with those end points . Thus there will be a way in which the electron travels to C , emits a <unk> there and then absorbs it again at D before moving on to B. Or it could do this kind of thing twice , or more . In short we have a <unk> @-@ like situation in which if we look closely at a line it breaks up into a collection of " simple " lines , each of which , if looked at closely , are in turn composed of " simple " lines , and so on ad <unk> . This is a very difficult situation to handle . If adding that detail only altered things slightly then it would not have been too bad , but disaster struck when it was found that the simple correction mentioned above led to infinite probability <unk> . In time this problem was " fixed " by the technique of <unk> . However , Feynman himself remained unhappy about it , calling it a " <unk> process " . 
 Within the above framework physicists were then able to calculate to a high degree of accuracy some of the properties of electrons , such as the <unk> magnetic <unk> moment . However , as Feynman points out , it fails totally to explain why particles such as the electron have the masses they do . " There is no theory that adequately explains these numbers . We use the numbers in all our theories , but we don 't understand them – what they are , or where they come from . I believe that from a fundamental point of view , this is a very interesting and serious problem . " 
 <unk> , <unk> is an <unk> gauge theory with the symmetry group U ( 1 ) . The gauge field , which <unk> the interaction between the charged spin @-@ 1 / 2 fields , is the electromagnetic field . The <unk> <unk> for a spin @-@ 1 / 2 field interacting with the electromagnetic field is given by the real part of 
 <formula> is the <unk> four @-@ potential of the electromagnetic field generated by the electron itself ; 
 The left @-@ hand side is like the original <unk> equation and the right @-@ hand side is the interaction with the electromagnetic field . 
 One further important equation can be found by <unk> the above <unk> into another <unk> – <unk> equation , this time for the field <formula> : 
 which is a wave equation for the four potential , the <unk> version of the classical Maxwell <unk> in the Lorenz gauge . ( In the above equation , the square represents the D <unk> operator . ) 
 This theory can be <unk> <unk> by treating <unk> and <unk> sectors as free . This permits us to build a set of asymptotic states which can be used to start a computation of the probability <unk> for different processes . In order to do so , we have to <unk> an evolution operator that , for a given initial state <formula> , will give a final state <formula> in such a way to have 
 This technique is also known as the S @-@ matrix . The evolution operator is obtained in the interaction picture where time evolution is given by the interaction <unk> , which is the integral over space of the second term in the <unk> density given above : 
 where T is the time ordering operator . This evolution operator only has meaning as a series , and what we get here is a <unk> series with the fine structure constant as the development <unk> . This series is called the <unk> series . 
 Using <unk> theorem on the terms of the <unk> series , all the terms of the S @-@ matrix for quantum <unk> can be computed through the technique of Feynman <unk> . In this case rules for drawing are the following 
 To these rules we must add a further one for closed loops that implies an integration on <unk> <formula> , since these internal ( " virtual " ) particles are not constrained to any specific energy – momentum – even that usually required by special relativity ( see this article for details ) . From them , <unk> of probability <unk> are <unk> given . An example is Compton scattering , with an electron and a <unk> undergoing elastic scattering . Feynman <unk> are in this case 
 and so we are able to get the corresponding <unk> at the first order of a <unk> series for the S @-@ matrix : 
 Higher order terms can be <unk> computed for the evolution operator but these terms display <unk> containing the following simpler ones 
 <unk> has become an essential criterion for a quantum field theory to be considered as a viable one . All the theories describing fundamental interactions , except <unk> whose quantum counterpart is presently under very active research , are <unk> theories . 
 An argument by Freeman <unk> shows that the radius of convergence of the <unk> series in <unk> is zero . The basic argument goes as follows : if the <unk> constant were negative , this would be equivalent to the <unk> force constant being negative . This would " reverse " the electromagnetic interaction so that like charges would attract and unlike charges would repel . This would render the vacuum unstable against decay into a cluster of electrons on one side of the universe and a cluster of <unk> on the other side of the universe . Because the theory is ' sick ' for any negative value of the <unk> constant , the series do not converge , but are an asymptotic series . 
 From a modern perspective , we say that <unk> is not well defined as a quantum field theory to <unk> high energy . The <unk> constant runs to <unk> at finite energy , <unk> a <unk> pole . The problem is essentially that <unk> appears to suffer from quantum triviality issues . This is one of the motivations for <unk> <unk> within a Grand Unified Theory .

 The purpose of the new line is to allow regional and express trains to run directly between <unk> Station , <unk> Station and <unk> Station , without being slowed and delayed by commuter trains that make frequent stops at intermediate stations . The <unk> Line will improve <unk> , and capacity will increase from 12 to 26 trains per hour in each direction . Travel time from <unk> to <unk> Station will be reduced from 20 to 13 minutes . The line has received criticism for not being a true high @-@ speed line , and for <unk> Station not being in compliance with accessibility requirements . Similar parallel , high @-@ speed lines have been or will be built northeast and southeast of Oslo . 
 Following the construction of the high @-@ speed Gardermoen Line from Oslo , via Oslo Airport , Gardermoen , to <unk> , the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications started planning additional high @-@ speed lines west and southeast of Oslo . The <unk> and <unk> Lines would allow express and regional trains to travel faster and more reliably to <unk> and <unk> , leaving the old tracks for slower freight trains , and commuter trains making frequent stops . Construction of the <unk> Line will , at the earliest , be completed in 2015 . 
 The Gardermoen Line had shown that profits could be made by operating passenger trains , but that it would not be possible to debt @-@ finance short @-@ distance tracks in Eastern Norway . Therefore , a conventional financial method for the <unk> Line was started . While the railway is entirely financed through allocation through the state budget , the <unk> was secured through a political compromise for investments in Greater Oslo , the Oslo <unk> 2 . <unk> of a diverse range of road and public transport investments — including new <unk> , extension of the Oslo Metro and new railways — would be made through a " package " . This involved both state , county and toll funding being collected in one lot , and then <unk> the funds to the agencies responsible for the investments . 
 Prior to the construction , the Western Corridor had a capacity of 12 – 14 trains per hour in each direction west of <unk> . The first section of the <unk> Line , from <unk> to <unk> , increased the capacity with an additional two trains . The opening of <unk> Station will increase capacity with four more , since all stations along the line between Oslo and <unk> will then have four platforms . When the whole line is completed , total capacity in the Western Corridor will be 26 trains per hour . This is equivalent to 5 @,@ 500 cars per hour , and exceeds the capacity of a four @-@ lane motorway . 
 The <unk> Line is also a necessary component to allow a high @-@ speed route to be built along the <unk> and <unk> Lines . The former is planned to branch off at <unk> , while the latter would branch of at <unk> , and become a 60 @-@ kilometre ( 37 mi ) <unk> of the Bergen Line . The first sections of the upgraded <unk> Line opened in 1995 and 2001 , and additional proposals are under planning for the remaining sections . 
 <unk> Station is 14 @.@ 14 km ( 8 @.@ 79 mi ) from Oslo S , at 12 @.@ 0 metres ( 39 @.@ 4 ft ) elevation . The track layout has been criticised by among others Norsk <unk> , for not permitting high through speeds . A sharp curve before the station will not permit trains to travel at more than 80 km / h ( 50 mph ) , even if they are not scheduled to stop at the station . This will increase travel time , and hinder the efficiency of the line should it be used later for high @-@ speed lines to <unk> or Western Norway . The proposed <unk> Line would <unk> just west of <unk> Station . 
 Construction of the second section started in 2007 and was completed in 2011 . The section between <unk> and <unk> is 6 @.@ 7 kilometres ( 4 @.@ 2 mi ) , most of which runs through the 5 @.@ 5 @-@ kilometre ( 3 @.@ 4 mi ) <unk> Tunnel . There was local debate whether the tunnel should be built using a tunnel boring machine or by drilling and blasting . The latter was preferred by the Rail Administration , since it allowed a shorter construction time , and a NOK 700 million saving . Total budget is NOK 2 @,@ 787 million . 
 <unk> Station serves as the main public transport hub for Eastern <unk> , parts of Western Oslo and Fornebu . Within 800 metres ( 2 @,@ 600 ft ) , there are 20 @,@ 000 jobs , with an additional 10 – 15 @,@ 000 in development . Located 7 @.@ 00 kilometres ( 4 @.@ 35 mi ) west of Oslo S , it is receiving a major overhaul between 2006 and 2009 , including 1 @.@ 2 km ( 0 @.@ 75 mi ) of new track . The current station will be entirely replaced , and the number of platforms increased from two to four . More than one thousand buses depart from <unk> Station each day , and it has been proposed as the terminus of the Fornebu Line — a <unk> originally proposed as a people <unk> . 
 The NOK 1 billion renovation has become a scandal , due to the station being built in a curve , and thus does not have straight platforms . This will become a security problem ; in addition it will create a gap up to 40 centimetres ( 16 in ) between the train and the platform , hindering accessibility to the trains for disabled people . Norges <unk> claims they will have to buy new trains due to this station alone , costing the state @-@ owned company NOK 1 @.@ 5 billion . Minister of Transport , <unk> <unk> <unk> from the Centre Party , has said that resolving the problems by building a straight station is not an alternative , since it would cost an additional hundred @-@ millions of NOK , and delay the new station several years . 
 The last section is a proposed 2 @.@ 1 @-@ kilometre ( 1 @.@ 3 mi ) section from <unk> to <unk> ; the latter not being modified as part of the extension , since it was upgraded in 1999 . The government has not set a date to start construction , but it will not be until at least <unk> , since other projects will be <unk> over this section . No specific route has been finalised , and the project has been proposed to either run parallel to the current <unk> Line , or by placing all four tracks through a new tunnel . The former has been preferred by the Rail Administration , while the latter — which would cost NOK 1 billion more — has been preferred by the municipality . There are no intermediate commuter stations between <unk> and <unk> , so there is little <unk> or speed potential to gain from the construction , since the Oslo Tunnel from <unk> to Oslo Central Station will still remain a bottleneck with only two tracks . <unk> have claimed that there is no gain from building this section without building two additional tracks all the way to the central station . 
 Norges <unk> ( NSB ) operates their express trains on the Bergen and <unk> Line on the <unk> Line , along with the regional trains along the <unk> Line . They also operate some of Oslo <unk> Rail trains , that do not stop on the intermediate stations . Other commuter trains use the old <unk> Line , along with freight trains . However , in 2006 , the night freight trains were moved to the new line , despite operating at less than 100 km / h ( 62 mph ) . The <unk> airport express train operates along the line three times per hour using Class 71 multiple units , connecting the main stations west of Oslo to Oslo Airport , Gardermoen . 
 With the opening of the new line , NSB stopped operating their commuter trains from <unk> to Oslo with stops at <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . <unk> from <unk> now need to transfer in <unk> , but all other passengers have travel times reduced from 48 to 36 minutes . 
 The Dakota , Minnesota and Eastern Railroad ( reporting mark <unk> ) is a Class II railroad subsidiary of the Canadian Pacific Railway operating across South Dakota and southern Minnesota in the Northern Plains of the United States . <unk> of the railroad also extend into Wyoming , Nebraska and Iowa . 
 DM & E began operations on September 5 , 1986 , over trackage spun off from the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company in South Dakota and Minnesota . Many of the negotiations were handled by the office of Senator Larry <unk> and his legal counsel Kevin V. <unk> . After <unk> 's successful first decade , <unk> succeeded J. C. <unk> as president of the railroad on November 7 , 1996 . 
 DM & E purchased the assets of I & M Rail Link railroad in 2002 , renaming it Iowa , Chicago and Eastern Railroad . DM & E combined its management and dispatching duties with those of <unk> under the holding company Cedar American Rail Holdings . The combined system directly connects Chicago through Iowa to Kansas City , Minneapolis @-@ St. Paul and continues as far west as Rapid City , South Dakota . Smaller branches extend into portions of Wisconsin , Wyoming and Nebraska . 
 In September 2007 it was announced that Canadian Pacific Railway ( <unk> ) would acquire the DM & E upon approval by the Surface Transportation Board of the US Department of Transportation . The <unk> announced its approval of the purchase plan on September 30 , 2008 . The merger was completed , and the official last day of operations for the DM & E was October 30 , 2008 . 
 In the early 1980s , Chicago and North Western Railway ( <unk> ) announced plans to abandon a section of railroad through Minnesota and South Dakota that dated to 1859 . Due to pressure from customers and Senator Larry <unk> from South Dakota , a deal was reached and announced on April 24 , 1986 , creating the Dakota , Minnesota and Eastern Railroad out of sections of <unk> from <unk> , Minnesota , to Rapid City , South Dakota . This deal also included buildings , rolling stock and <unk> , mostly rebuilt <unk> <unk> , from the <unk> . 
 DM & E began operations on this track on September 5 , 1986 . The railroad was expanded in 1995 when it acquired additional former <unk> branch lines from Rapid City , South Dakota , to Colony , Wyoming , and Crawford , Nebraska . 
 From startup to the railroad 's ten @-@ year anniversary in 1996 , DM & E hauled nearly 500 @,@ 000 <unk> of freight , which includes 700 million <unk> of grain . DM & E celebrated the anniversary with <unk> and employee appreciation events and excursions in <unk> , Minnesota , and Pierre , South Dakota . 
 Kevin V. <unk> , whom former United States President George H. W. Bush had appointed as US Attorney for South Dakota in 1991 , became president of DM & E on November 7 , 1996 . <unk> was no newcomer to the railroad ; he first became involved with DM & E in 1983 when he worked to prevent the abandonment of the former <unk> lines that eventually formed the first sections of DM & E 's mainline . <unk> the status <unk> on DM & E was not the fate that he had in mind for the railroad as he took the <unk> . 
 In 1997 , DM & E announced plans to expand into the <unk> River Basin ( <unk> ) in Wyoming and start providing unit coal train service from that area . The railroad filed an application for the expansion to the Surface Transportation Board ( <unk> ) on February 20 , 1998 . <unk> Northern Railroad built into this area in 1979 , and the Chicago and North Western Railway ( <unk> ) also sought to access the <unk> <unk> , a project accomplished by <unk> 's successor Union Pacific Railroad . DM & E would become the third railroad to tap into the coal deposits in the region . 
 DM & E 's expansion would require the construction of 281 miles ( <unk> km ) of new track , upgrading <unk> miles ( <unk> km ) of existing track ( including all of the railroad 's mainline track in Minnesota ) , new mainline connections <unk> and <unk> , Minnesota , and three new rail yards . The plan would be the largest new railroad construction in the United States since the completion of Milwaukee Road 's Pacific extension to Seattle , Washington , in 1909 . 
 The <unk> approved the application on December 10 of that year pending completion of an Environmental Impact Statement ( <unk> ) , which was released by the <unk> on September 27 , 2000 . 
 An analysis of the plan by Minnesota 's Dakota , Minnesota and Eastern Railroad Working Group in 2001 showed support among customers and freight <unk> , but DM & E 's expansion plan led to complaints among residents in communities along the railroad 's right @-@ of @-@ way . While some communities welcomed the railroad 's expansion plan as an opportunity for increased business within their own cities , other residents and businesses felt that roads in the area were not built with enough overpasses and <unk> to deal with the traffic flow problems that the longer and more frequent unit trains would produce at grade <unk> . The objectors cited concerns of the general public in safely and quickly traversing their communities as well as the ability of emergency vehicles to cross the tracks to reach emergency scenes or hospitals . The city of Rochester , Minnesota filed a lawsuit to force the railroad to build a bypass around the city . The bypass was estimated to cost around US $ 100 million . 
 After a period of public comment that lasted until March 16 , 2001 , and further review by the <unk> , the final <unk> was issued on November 19 , 2001 . In this final approval , the <unk> agreed with DM & E that no new bypasses around cities would be required even though the cities of Rochester , Minnesota , <unk> and Pierre , South Dakota , had requested them . In 2003 , a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit ordered the <unk> to re @-@ examine potential environmental issues around Rochester . The <unk> 's preliminary report , released in early 2005 , noted that no additional steps were needed by the railroad to alleviate noise and vibration caused by the projected increase in train traffic . 
 The court upheld the <unk> 's approval with <unk> for the new line 's environmental impact , including the projected increase in the frequency of train horn <unk> along the line . From the court 's ruling , the <unk> prepared a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement which sets forth <unk> strategies for the railroad . On February 15 , 2006 , the United States Surface Transportation Board ( <unk> ) announced its final approval of the railroad 's 1998 application . 
 In April 2004 , DM & E was awarded the power of eminent domain in South Dakota by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in Pierre , South Dakota . The ruling overturned part of South Dakota legislation passed in 1999 ( two years after the railroad first announced its intentions to expand ) that would have impaired railroad operations and construction in the state . This decision <unk> the legal process by which the railroad can effectively force landowners along the proposed new route to sell their land to the railroad . 
 With the final <unk> in place and approval from the <unk> , DM & E had the authority to undertake the expansion as proposed , but needed financing . On February 26 , 2007 , the <unk> rejected a proposed $ 2 @.@ 3 billion loan to DM & E. In announcing the decision , Administrator Joseph H. <unk> noted that the project proposal met many federal requirements for the loan but cited concerns that the railroad might not be able to handle cost <unk> during construction or to <unk> such a <unk> amount after construction is completed . 
 DM & E hauled nearly 60 @,@ 000 <unk> of various freight shipments in fiscal year 2002 , serving approximately 130 customers along the railroad 's mainline . Of these shipments , 53 % were grains or grain products , 24 % were <unk> and <unk> clay , 7 % were cement , and 5 % were wood and lumber products ; the remaining 11 % were split among all other types of freight . 
 On February 21 , 2002 , DM & E announced that it would purchase the railroad assets of 1 @,@ 700 @-@ mile ( 2 @,@ 700 km ) I & M Rail Link ( <unk> ) from its then current owners Washington Corporation . DM & E renamed the <unk> property to Iowa , Chicago and Eastern Railroad ( <unk> & E ) and began operating it under that name on July 30 , 2002 . Although a purchase price was not stated in the original announcement , an article in the May 2002 Trains Magazine suggests that several industry sources believed the total to be around $ 150 million . 
 DM & E and <unk> & E combined management under the holding company Cedar American Rail Holdings . <unk> of both railroads were given a unified paint scheme ( see below ) and interchanges were streamlined between the two railroads . The administration of both railroads is handled by Cedar , further <unk> processes between the two railroads . As a result , the combined DM & E / <unk> & E system makes up the largest Class II railroad ( by route @-@ miles ) in the United States ; it is also the eighth largest system of all American railroads and the only system with direct rail connections with all Class I railroads in North America . 
 In its first twenty years of operations , the railroad 's revenues had increased more than <unk> , from $ 22 million in 1987 to $ 258 million in 2006 , with $ 290 million projected in 2007 and $ 340 million for 2008 . Its operating ratio ( the ratio of operating expenses to revenues ) declined to 70 @.@ 2 % in 2006 and was projected to improve further to 67 @.@ 6 % in 2007 . Its traffic was a mix of agricultural , coal , and industrial products , and <unk> shipments were projected to exceed one billion gallons in 2008 . 
 On September 4 , 2007 , the Canadian Pacific Railway ( CPR ) announced it was acquiring the DM & E from its owners , London @-@ based <unk> Private <unk> , for US $ 1 @.@ 48 billion , and future payments of over $ 1 @.@ 0 billion contingent on commencement of construction on the <unk> River extension and specified volumes of coal shipments from the <unk> River basin . The transaction will include the <unk> and other affiliated companies . The merger is an " end @-@ to @-@ end " consolidation ; the lines presently interchange at three points , including the <unk> , Minnesota connection between the DM & E 's main line across southern Minnesota and <unk> 's Chicago main . Kevin <unk> , president of the DM & E , has called <unk> the DM & E 's " natural partner " and the transaction a " natural fit " . 
 The acquisition will give <unk> access to shipments of agricultural products and <unk> in addition to coal from the Wyoming coal fields . <unk> has stated its intention to use this purchase to gain access to the <unk> River and ship coal to <unk> and eastern utilities . The transaction is subject to approval of the Surface Transportation Board , which is expected to take a year . <unk> analysts have stated that competing railroads for <unk> River coal , the Union Pacific and <unk> , could challenge the acquisition and delay <unk> approval , but are unlikely to prevent it . At least until approval is received , the DM & E will continue to operate as a separate entity . 
 On December 3 , 2012 , <unk> announced it was indefinitely placing on hold plans for building new trackage into the <unk> River Basin . The next day the railroad announced its intention to sell the entire ex @-@ DM & E west of Tracy , Minnesota , roughly 700 miles ( 1 @,@ 100 km ) of track . On January 2 , 2014 <unk> announced that all track west of Tracy , Minnesota was to be sold to Rapid City , Pierre and Eastern Railroad , a subsidiary of <unk> & Wyoming , a short line operator . The sale was completed on May 30 , 2014 for $ 210 million . Most of the Rapid City , Pierre and Eastern 's employees came over from the DM & E. 
 DM & E operated over twelve subdivisions . The divisions were located in Minnesota , South Dakota , Iowa , and Nebraska . 
 DM & E originally purchased used first @-@ generation <unk> from a variety of railroads ; in the early years it was more common to see a <unk> with a Milwaukee Road or Chicago and North Western Railway paint scheme than a DM & E paint scheme . Over the years , the <unk> were <unk> , and many of them are now in DM & E 's paint scheme ( which is closely mirrored by that of sister Iowa , Chicago and Eastern Railroad ) of blue with a yellow stripe along its length . 
 DM & E eventually assigns names to all of its <unk> when they are <unk> , usually after locations along its right @-@ of @-@ way , but a few exceptions have been named for people ( like road number 550 , named after Senator Larry <unk> ) . All of the first @-@ generation diesel <unk> purchased from Chicago and North Western and Milwaukee Road have since been replaced with more recent <unk> , although the newer <unk> were also bought used . 
 In 1987 , at the railroad 's one @-@ year anniversary , DM & E owned 39 <unk> and leased five more for a total of 44 <unk> <unk> . By the railroad 's tenth anniversary in 1996 , DM & E owned 69 <unk> and owned or leased over 1 @,@ 500 cars including over 600 covered <unk> for grain and cement shipments . In 2001 , the number of <unk> owned stayed about the same , while the number of cars increased to about 5 @,@ 000 with 52 % of them in dedicated grain service . 
 J. C. ( Pete ) <unk> ( 1986 – 1996 ) began his railroad career in 1953 , eventually working for Chicago and North Western in the early 1980s . When DM & E was formed in 1986 , <unk> became the new railroad 's first president . 
 Javier Alfonso López ( born July 11 , 1977 ) is a Puerto <unk> @-@ born professional baseball pitcher for the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball . He is 6 feet 5 inches ( 1 @.@ 96 m ) tall and weighs 220 pounds ( 100 kg ) . López previously pitched for the Colorado Rockies ( 2003 – 2005 ) , Arizona <unk> ( 2005 ) , Boston Red Sox ( 2006 – 09 ) and Pittsburgh Pirates ( 2010 ) . He is a left @-@ handed specialist known for his <unk> delivery . He also bats left @-@ handed . 
 López attended the University of Virginia , earning a degree in psychology despite leaving early to begin his baseball career . He was selected by the Arizona <unk> in the fourth round of the 1998 Major League Baseball ( MLB ) Draft . He began his career as a starting pitcher but struggled and converted into a <unk> ( or submarine ) reliever while still in the <unk> ' organization . Before the 2003 season , he was selected by the Boston Red Sox in the Rule 5 draft , but he was traded to the Colorado Rockies during spring training . He spent all of 2003 on Colorado 's roster , nearly tying the franchise record for most consecutive batters retired and finishing third among major league <unk> in games pitched . He struggled the next two seasons , getting claimed off waivers and later sent to the minors by Arizona in 2005 . In 2006 , he signed with the Chicago White Sox but failed to make the team and spent the first part of the season in the minors before getting traded to Boston during the year . 
 López served four <unk> with Boston in 2006 . In 2007 , he had three different <unk> but appeared in 61 games , posting a 3 @.@ 10 earned run average ( ERA ) . He posted a 15 @.@ 43 ERA in the playoffs but won his first World Series ring as the Red Sox defeated Colorado in four games . In 2008 , he spent the entire season on a major league roster for the first time since 2003 . He posted a 9 @.@ 26 ERA in his first 14 games of 2009 before getting sent to the minors for the rest of the season . In 2010 , he signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates but was traded to the San Francisco Giants during the season . He had his lowest ERA that year ( 2 @.@ 34 ) and won another World Series as the Giants defeated the Texas Rangers to win their first World Series since 1954 . In 2011 , López was one of two major league relief pitchers to throw at least 50 innings without giving up a home run . He won his third World Series in 2012 as the Giants defeated the Detroit Tigers in four games . In 2013 , López posted a career @-@ best 1 @.@ 83 ERA . He won his fourth World Series in 2014 as the Giants defeated the Kansas City Royals in seven games . As of 2014 , he is the only active player to have played on 4 or more World Series championship teams . 
 Although he was born in Puerto Rico , López grew up in Fairfax , Virginia . He and his wife , <unk> , attended Robinson Secondary School in Fairfax , Virginia . Growing up , his dream was to be an FBI agent like his father . 
 López went to college at the University of Virginia ( <unk> ) and played for the Virginia Cavaliers baseball team . Through August 2011 , he was one of 29 former <unk> players to have made it to the major leagues , along with among others Mark Reynolds , and Ryan Zimmerman . While playing at <unk> , he went 12 – 9 with a 6 @.@ 30 earned run average ( ERA ) . As a hitter , he had a batting average of <unk> , 15 home runs , and 71 runs batted in ( <unk> ) . However , while still at <unk> , he discovered that pitching was most likely to get him to the major leagues . Despite leaving college after only three years to play professional baseball , López continued working on his degree in psychology , which he earned in 2002 to fulfill a promise to his father @-@ in @-@ law . He also said , " I had done three years at a great university . I figured I should finish . " 
 After three seasons at <unk> , López was drafted by the Arizona <unk> in the fourth round of the 1998 Major League Baseball ( MLB ) Draft . He began his minor league career as a starting pitcher for the South Bend Silver Hawks of the A Midwest League .

 In 2001 , deciding that he would not be able to reach the major leagues as a starter , López converted to a <unk> and moved to the bullpen .

Due to major league rules , Arizona was unable to call him up until April 24 . He had another poor season , having a record of 1 – 1 and an 11 @.@ 02 ERA , the highest in the majors among <unk> who made at least 30 appearances .

 On June 15 , 2006 , López was traded to the Boston Red Sox for David <unk> . He posted a 4 @.@ 32 ERA in 14 appearances before getting sent to the <unk> Red Sox of the International League on July 17 because it was too " tough " for the Red Sox to carry a left @-@ handed specialist at that point in the season , according to manager Terry <unk> .

He won his second World Series ring as the Giants defeated the Rangers in five games to win their first World Series since 1954 . 
 Since joining the Giants in 2010 , López has become one of the premier <unk> specialists in the game . On May 12 , 2011 , he recorded his first save since 2006 in a 3 – 2 victory over the <unk> . Following the game , he crossed his arms , imitating Giants ' closer Brian Wilson 's post @-@ save gesture . In 70 games in 2011 , he had a 5 – 2 record , a 2 @.@ 72 ERA , and 40 strikeouts in 50 innings pitched . He and Brad <unk> were the only relief pitchers in the major leagues to toss at least 50 innings without allowing a home run . His <unk> opponent batting average ( <unk> ) against left @-@ <unk> was the eighth @-@ lowest in the NL . 
 After the 2011 season , the Giants re @-@ signed López to a two @-@ year , $ 8 @.@ 5 million contract . On July 6 , 2012 , López gave up his first home run since joining the Giants in 2010 when he allowed a 457 @-@ foot home run to Pedro <unk> in a 6 – 5 victory over the Pirates .

Following struggles by Santiago <unk> ( who had replaced an injured Wilson as the Giants ' closer ) , Giants ' manager Bruce <unk> announced on August 7 that the Giants would be going to a " bullpen by committee " strategy , with López , Sergio <unk> , and Jeremy <unk> pitching the final two innings of close games , depending on which hitters they would be facing . <unk> and López received most of the save opportunities ; <unk> only had one save after that point . López received six save opportunities after August 7 and converted each of them . In 70 games , López had a 3 – 0 record , a 2 @.@ 50 ERA , and 28 strikeouts in 36 innings while converting seven out of nine save opportunities . He stranded 87 @.@ 9 % of inherited runners , the third @-@ best mark in the NL . López made five appearances in the NLDS and the NLCS , allowing no runs as the Giants won both of those series . He did not pitch in the World Series but won his third career World Series ring as the Giants swept the Detroit Tigers .

He made 69 appearances in 2013 , going 4 – 2 with a career @-@ best 1 @.@ 83 ERA and striking out 37 in 39 1 ⁄ 3 innings . He held left @-@ handed hitters to a <unk> <unk> . On November 20 , 2013 , López was re @-@ signed by the Giants to a three @-@ year , $ 13 million contract . 
 López appeared in 65 games in 2014 , recording a 3 @.@ 11 ERA with 22 strikeouts and 19 walks .

 López 's main pitch is a two @-@ seam fastball in the low 80s , and his secondary pitch is a slider in the high 70s . Against left @-@ handed hitters he will sometimes mix in a curveball . López 's distinctive <unk> delivery makes him appealing as a left @-@ handed specialist ; through the 2013 season , <unk> have hit only <unk> against him , while <unk> have hit <unk> . 
 After López struggled to begin his professional career , throwing over the top , he decided he needed to change his style . In the <unk> ' system in 2002 , with the help of Mike Myers , he began throwing <unk> ( or submarine ) , which Andy <unk> called " a decision that changed his life . " 
 López is married to <unk> Richards , with whom he attended high school and college . The couple has two children : <unk> ( March 19 , 2010 ) and Christian ( October 26 , 2012 ) . Because López was in the 2012 World Series when Christian was born , he had to fly back home for the birth between Games 2 and 3 . He and his family reside in Denver , Colorado . López is a Christian . He says , " I do everything through faith , for sure . " 
 <unk> ( / <unk> , <unk> / ; Latin : Titus <unk> Caesar <unk> Augustus ; 24 October 51 – 18 September 96 ) was Roman emperor from 81 to 96 . <unk> was the third and last emperor of the <unk> dynasty . 
 <unk> 's youth and early career were largely spent in the shadow of his brother Titus , who gained military <unk> during the First Jewish – Roman War . This situation continued under the rule of his father <unk> , who became emperor in 69 following the civil war known as the Year of the Four <unk> . While Titus held a great many offices under the rule of his father , <unk> was left with honours but no responsibilities . <unk> died in 79 and was succeeded by Titus , whose own reign came to an unexpected end when he was struck by a fatal illness in 81 . The following day <unk> was declared Emperor by the <unk> Guard , commencing a reign that lasted fifteen years – longer than any man who had ruled since <unk> . 
 <unk> was born in Rome on 24 October 51 , the youngest son of Titus <unk> <unk> — commonly known as <unk> — and <unk> <unk> Major . He had an older sister , <unk> the Younger , and brother , also named Titus <unk> <unk> . 
 <unk> of civil war during the 1st century BC had contributed greatly to the demise of the old aristocracy of Rome , which a new Italian nobility gradually replaced in prominence during the early part of the 1st century . One such family , the <unk> , or <unk> <unk> , rose from relative obscurity to prominence in just four generations , acquiring wealth and status under the emperors of the Julio @-@ <unk> dynasty . <unk> 's great @-@ grandfather , Titus <unk> <unk> , had served as a <unk> under Pompey during Caesar 's civil war . His military career ended in disgrace when he fled the battlefield at the Battle of <unk> in 48 BC . 
 By all appearances , the <unk> enjoyed high imperial favour throughout the 40s and 60s . While Titus received a court education in the company of <unk> , <unk> pursued a successful political and military career . Following a prolonged period of retirement during the 50s , he returned to public office under <unk> , serving as <unk> of the Africa province in 63 , and accompanying the emperor during an official tour of Greece in 66 . 
 The same year the Jews of the <unk> province <unk> against the Roman Empire in what is now known as the First Jewish @-@ Roman War . <unk> was assigned to lead the Roman army against the insurgents , with Titus — who had completed his military education by this time — in charge of a legion . 
 By the time he was 6 years old , <unk> 's mother and sister had long since died , while his father and brother were continuously active in the Roman military , commanding armies in <unk> and <unk> . For <unk> , this meant that a significant part of his adolescence was spent in the absence of his near relatives . During the Jewish @-@ Roman wars , he was likely taken under the care of his uncle Titus <unk> <unk> II , at the time serving as city prefect of Rome ; or possibly even Marcus <unk> <unk> , a loyal friend of the <unk> and the future successor to <unk> . 
 He received the education of a young man of the privileged <unk> class , studying rhetoric and literature . In his biography in the Lives of the Twelve <unk> , <unk> attests to <unk> 's ability to quote the important poets and writers such as Homer or Virgil on appropriate occasions , and describes him as a learned and educated adolescent , with elegant conversation . Among his first published works were poetry , as well as writings on law and administration . 
 Unlike his brother Titus , <unk> was not educated at court . Whether he received formal military training is not recorded , but according to <unk> , he displayed considerable <unk> with the bow and arrow . A detailed description of <unk> 's appearance and character is provided by <unk> , who devotes a substantial part of his biography to his personality . 
 He was tall of stature , with a modest expression and a high colour . His eyes were large , but his sight was somewhat dim . He was handsome and graceful too , especially when a young man , and indeed in his whole body with the exception of his feet , the toes of which were somewhat cramped . In later life he had the further <unk> of <unk> , a protruding belly , and <unk> legs , though the latter had become thin from a long illness . 
 <unk> was allegedly extremely sensitive regarding his <unk> , which he disguised in later life by wearing <unk> . According to <unk> , he even wrote a book on the subject of hair care . With regard to <unk> 's personality , however , the account of <unk> alternates sharply between portraying <unk> as the emperor @-@ <unk> , a man both physically and <unk> lazy , and the intelligent , refined personality drawn elsewhere . 
 Historian Brian Jones concludes in The Emperor <unk> that assessing the true nature of <unk> 's personality is inherently complicated by the bias of the surviving sources . Common threads nonetheless emerge from the available evidence . He appears to have lacked the natural <unk> of his brother and father . He was prone to suspicion , displayed an odd , sometimes self @-@ deprecating sense of humour , and often communicated in cryptic ways . 
 This ambiguity of character was further exacerbated by his <unk> , and as he grew older , he increasingly displayed a preference for solitude , which may have stemmed from his isolated upbringing . Indeed , by the age of eighteen nearly all of his closest relatives had died by war or disease . Having spent the greater part of his early life in the <unk> of <unk> 's reign , his formative years would have been strongly influenced by the political turmoil of the 60s , culminating with the civil war of 69 , which brought his family to power . 
 On 9 June 68 , amid growing opposition of the Senate and the army , <unk> committed suicide and with him the Julio @-@ <unk> dynasty came to an end . Chaos ensued , leading to a year of brutal civil war known as the Year of the Four <unk> , during which the four most influential generals in the Roman Empire — <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> — successively <unk> for imperial power . 
 News of <unk> 's death reached <unk> as he was preparing to <unk> the city of Jerusalem . Almost simultaneously the Senate had declared <unk> , then governor of <unk> <unk> ( modern northern Spain ) , as Emperor of Rome . Rather than continue his campaign , <unk> decided to await further orders and send Titus to <unk> the new Emperor . 
 Before reaching Italy , Titus learnt that <unk> had been murdered and replaced by <unk> , the governor of <unk> ( modern Portugal ) . At the same time <unk> and his armies in <unk> had risen in revolt and prepared to march on Rome , intent on <unk> <unk> . Not wanting to risk being taken hostage by one side or the other , Titus abandoned the journey to Rome and rejoined his father in <unk> . 
 In Rome , <unk> was placed under house arrest by <unk> , as a safeguard against <unk> aggression . Support for the old emperor <unk> as more <unk> around the empire pledged their allegiance to <unk> . On 24 October 69 , the forces of <unk> and <unk> met at the Second Battle of <unk> , which ended in a crushing defeat for the armies of <unk> . 
 During the night , he was joined by his relatives , including <unk> . The armies of <unk> were nearing Rome but the besieged <unk> party did not hold out for longer than a day . On 19 December , <unk> burst onto the Capitol and in a <unk> , <unk> was captured and executed . <unk> managed to escape by <unk> himself as a <unk> of Isis and spent the night in safety with one of his father 's supporters , Cornelius <unk> . 
 By the afternoon of 20 December , <unk> was dead , his armies having been defeated by the <unk> <unk> . With nothing more to be feared , <unk> came forward to meet the invading forces ; he was universally <unk> by the title of Caesar and the mass of troops conducted him to his father 's house . The following day , 21 December , the Senate proclaimed <unk> emperor of the Roman Empire . 
 Although the war had officially ended , a state of anarchy and lawlessness <unk> in the first days following the demise of <unk> . Order was properly restored by <unk> in early 70 but <unk> did not enter Rome until September of that year . In the meantime , <unk> acted as the representative of the <unk> family in the Roman Senate . He received the title of Caesar and was appointed <unk> with <unk> power . 
 Although the revolt was quickly suppressed , exaggerated reports of disaster prompted <unk> to depart the capital with reinforcements of his own . <unk> eagerly sought the opportunity to attain military glory and joined the other officers with the intention of commanding a legion of his own . According to <unk> , <unk> was not keen on this prospect but since he considered <unk> a liability in any capacity that was entrusted to him , he preferred to keep him close at hand rather than in Rome . 
 Prior to becoming Emperor , <unk> 's role in the <unk> government was largely ceremonial . In June 71 , Titus returned triumphant from the war in <unk> . Ultimately , the rebellion had claimed the lives of over 1 million people , a majority of whom were Jewish . The city and temple of Jerusalem were completely destroyed , its most valuable treasures carried off by the Roman army , and nearly 100 @,@ 000 people were captured and enslaved . 
 For his victory , the Senate awarded Titus a Roman triumph . On the day of the festivities , the <unk> family <unk> into the capital , preceded by a lavish parade that displayed the spoils of the war . The family procession was headed by <unk> and Titus , while <unk> , riding a magnificent white horse , followed with the remaining <unk> relatives . 
 <unk> of the Jewish resistance were executed in the <unk> <unk> , after which the procession closed with religious sacrifices at the Temple of Jupiter . A <unk> arch , the <unk> of Titus , was erected at the south @-@ east entrance to the <unk> to commemorate the successful end of the war . 
 He held six <unk> during <unk> 's reign but only one of these , in 73 , was an ordinary <unk> . The other five were less prestigious <unk> <unk> , which he held in 71 , 75 , 76 , 77 and 79 respectively , usually replacing his father or brother in mid @-@ January . While ceremonial , these offices no doubt gained <unk> valuable experience in the Roman Senate , and may have contributed to his later reservations about its relevance . 
 Under <unk> and Titus , non @-@ <unk> were virtually excluded from the important public offices . <unk> himself all but disappeared from historical records during this time , and it is believed he died sometime between 75 and 77 . Real power was <unk> concentrated in the hands of the <unk> faction ; the weakened Senate only maintained the facade of democracy . 
 Because Titus effectively acted as co @-@ emperor with his father , no abrupt change in <unk> policy occurred when <unk> died on 23 June 79 . Titus assured <unk> that full partnership in the government would soon be his , but neither <unk> power nor <unk> of any kind was conferred upon him during Titus ' brief reign . The new Emperor was not eager to alter this arrangement : he was under forty and at the height of his power . 
 Two major disasters struck during 79 and 80 . On 24 August 79 , Mount <unk> erupted , burying the surrounding cities of Pompeii and <unk> under metres of ash and <unk> ; the following year , a fire broke out in Rome that lasted three days and that destroyed a number of important public buildings . Consequently , Titus spent much of his reign coordinating relief efforts and restoring damaged property . On 13 September 81 after barely two years in office , he unexpectedly died of fever during a trip to the Sabine territories . 
 Ancient authors have implicated <unk> in the death of his brother , either by directly accusing him of murder , or implying he left the ailing Titus for dead , even alleging that during his lifetime , <unk> was openly plotting against his brother . It is difficult to assess the <unk> <unk> of these statements given the known bias of the surviving sources . <unk> affection was likely at a minimum , but this was hardly surprising , considering that <unk> had barely seen Titus after the age of seven . 
 Whatever the nature of their relationship , <unk> seems to have displayed little sympathy when his brother lay dying , instead making for the <unk> camp where he was proclaimed emperor . The following day , 14 September , the Senate confirmed <unk> 's powers , granting <unk> power , the office of <unk> <unk> , and the titles of Augustus , and <unk> <unk> . 
 As Emperor , <unk> quickly <unk> with the republican facade his father and brother had maintained during their reign . By moving the centre of government ( more or less formally ) to the imperial court , <unk> openly rendered the Senate 's powers obsolete . In his view , the Roman Empire was to be governed as a divine monarchy with himself as the benevolent <unk> at its head . 
 In addition to exercising absolute political power , <unk> believed the Emperor 's role encompassed every aspect of daily life , guiding the Roman people as a cultural and moral authority . To <unk> in the new era , he embarked on ambitious economic , military and cultural programs with the intention of restoring the Empire to the <unk> it had seen under the Emperor Augustus . 
 Despite these grand designs <unk> was determined to govern the Empire <unk> and <unk> . He became personally involved in all branches of the administration : edicts were issued governing the smallest details of everyday life and law , while taxation and public morals were <unk> enforced . According to <unk> , the imperial bureaucracy never ran more efficiently than under <unk> , whose exacting standards and suspicious nature maintained historically low corruption among provincial governors and elected officials . 
 Although he made no <unk> regarding the significance of the Senate under his absolute rule , those <unk> he deemed unworthy were expelled from the Senate , and in the distribution of public offices he rarely favoured family members ; a policy that stood in contrast to the <unk> practiced by <unk> and Titus . Above all , however , <unk> valued loyalty and <unk> in those he assigned to strategic posts , qualities he found more often in men of the <unk> order than in members of the Senate or his own family , whom he regarded with suspicion , and promptly removed from office if they disagreed with imperial policy . 
 <unk> 's tendency towards <unk> was nowhere more evident than in his financial policy . The question of whether <unk> left the Roman Empire in debt or with a surplus at the time of his death has been fiercely debated . The evidence points to a balanced economy for the greater part of <unk> 's reign . Upon his accession he <unk> the Roman currency dramatically . He increased the silver purity of the <unk> from 90 % to 98 % — the actual silver weight increasing from 2 @.@ 87 grams to 3 @.@ 26 grams . A financial crisis in 85 forced a <unk> of the silver purity and weight to 93 @.@ 5 % and 3 @.@ 04 grams respectively . 
 Nevertheless , the new values were still higher than the levels that <unk> and Titus had maintained during their <unk> . <unk> 's <unk> taxation policy ensured that this standard was sustained for the following eleven years . <unk> from this era displays a highly consistent degree of quality including meticulous attention to <unk> 's <unk> and refined artwork on the reverse portraits . 
 Jones estimates <unk> 's annual income at more than 1 @.@ 2 billion <unk> , of which over one @-@ third would presumably have been spent maintaining the Roman army . The other major expense was the extensive reconstruction of Rome . At the time of <unk> 's accession the city was still suffering from the damage caused by the Great Fire of 64 , the civil war of 69 and the fire in 79 . 
 Much more than a renovation project , <unk> 's building program was intended to be the crowning achievement of an Empire @-@ wide cultural renaissance . Around fifty structures were erected , restored or completed , achievements second only to those of Augustus . Among the most important new structures were an <unk> , a stadium , and an expansive palace on the <unk> Hill known as the <unk> Palace , which was designed by <unk> 's master architect <unk> . 
 The most important building <unk> restored was the Temple of Jupiter on the <unk> Hill , said to have been covered with a gilded roof . Among those completed were the Temple of <unk> and Titus , the <unk> of Titus and the Colosseum , to which he added a fourth level and finished the interior seating area . 
 In order to appease the people of Rome an estimated 135 million <unk> was spent on <unk> , or <unk> , throughout <unk> 's reign . The Emperor also revived the practice of public banquets , which had been reduced to a simple distribution of food under <unk> , while he invested large sums on entertainment and games . In 86 he founded the <unk> Games , a <unk> contest comprising athletic displays , chariot racing , and competitions for <unk> , music and acting . 
 <unk> himself supported the travel of competitors from all corners of the Empire to Rome and distributed the prizes . <unk> were also introduced into the regular <unk> games such as naval contests , nighttime battles , and female and dwarf <unk> fights . Lastly , he added two new factions to the chariot races , Gold and Purple , to race against the existing White , Red , Green and Blue factions . 
 The military campaigns undertaken during <unk> 's reign were generally defensive in nature , as the Emperor rejected the idea of <unk> warfare . His most significant military contribution was the development of the <unk> <unk> , which encompassed a vast network of roads , forts and <unk> constructed along the Rhine river to defend the Empire . Nevertheless , several important wars were fought in Gaul , against the <unk> , and across the <unk> frontier against the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> . 
 The conquest of Britain continued under the command of <unk> Julius <unk> , who expanded the Roman Empire as far as Caledonia , or modern day Scotland . <unk> also founded a new legion in 82 , the <unk> I <unk> , to fight against the <unk> . <unk> is also credited on the easternmost evidence of Roman presence , the rock inscription near <unk> mountain , in present @-@ day Azerbaijan . As judged by the carved titles of Caesar , Augustus and <unk> , the related march took place between 84 and 96 AD . 
 <unk> 's administration of the Roman army was characterized by the same <unk> involvement he exhibited in other branches of the government . His competence as a military strategist was criticized by his contemporaries however . Although he claimed several <unk> , these were largely propaganda manoeuvres . <unk> derided <unk> 's victory against the <unk> as a " mock triumph " , and criticized his decision to retreat in Britain following the conquests of <unk> . 
 Nevertheless , <unk> appears to have been very popular among the soldiers , spending an estimated three years of his reign among the army on campaigns — more than any emperor since Augustus — and raising their pay by one @-@ third . While the army command may have disapproved of his tactical and strategic decisions , the loyalty of the common soldier was <unk> . 
 Once Emperor , <unk> immediately sought to attain his long delayed military glory . As early as 82 , or possibly 83 , he went to Gaul , ostensibly to conduct a census , and suddenly ordered an attack on the <unk> . For this purpose , a new legion was founded , <unk> I <unk> , which constructed some 75 kilometres ( 46 mi ) of roads through <unk> territory to uncover the enemy 's hiding places . 
 Although little information survives of the battles fought , enough early victories were apparently achieved for <unk> to be back in Rome by the end of 83 , where he celebrated an elaborate triumph and conferred upon himself the title of <unk> . <unk> 's supposed victory was much <unk> by ancient authors , who described the campaign as " <unk> for " , and a " mock triumph " . The evidence lends some <unk> to these claims , as the <unk> would later play a significant role during the revolt of <unk> in 89 . 
 One of the most detailed reports of military activity under the <unk> dynasty was written by <unk> , whose biography of his father @-@ in @-@ law <unk> Julius <unk> largely concerns the conquest of Britain between 77 and 84 . <unk> arrived c . 77 as governor of Roman Britain , immediately launching campaigns into Caledonia ( modern Scotland ) . 
 In 82 <unk> crossed an unidentified body of water and defeated peoples unknown to the Romans until then . He fortified the coast facing Ireland , and <unk> recalls that his father @-@ in @-@ law often claimed the island could be conquered with a single legion and a few <unk> . He had given refuge to an exiled Irish king whom he hoped he might use as the excuse for conquest . This conquest never happened , but some historians believe that the crossing referred to was in fact a small @-@ scale <unk> or punitive expedition to Ireland . 
 Turning his attention from Ireland , the following year <unk> raised a fleet and pushed beyond the Forth into Caledonia . To aid the advance , a large <unk> fortress was constructed at <unk> . In the summer of 84 , <unk> faced the armies of the <unk> , led by <unk> , at the Battle of <unk> <unk> . Although the Romans inflicted heavy losses on the enemy , two @-@ thirds of the <unk> army escaped and hid in the Scottish marshes and Highlands , ultimately preventing <unk> from bringing the entire British island under his control . 
 Not long after <unk> 's recall from Britain , the Roman Empire entered into war with the Kingdom of <unk> in the East . Reinforcements were needed , and in 87 or 88 , <unk> ordered a large @-@ scale strategic withdrawal of troops in the British province . The fortress at <unk> was dismantled and the <unk> forts and <unk> abandoned , moving the Roman frontier some 120 kilometres ( 75 mi ) further south . The army command may have resented <unk> 's decision to retreat , but to him the <unk> territories never represented anything more than a loss to the Roman treasury . 
 <unk> quickly launched a counteroffensive , personally travelling to the region accompanied by a large force commanded by his <unk> prefect Cornelius <unk> . <unk> successfully drove the <unk> back across the border in mid @-@ 85 , prompting <unk> to return to Rome and celebrate his second triumph . 
 The victory proved short @-@ lived , however : as early in 86 <unk> embarked on an ill @-@ <unk> expedition into <unk> , which resulted in the complete destruction of the fifth legion , <unk> V <unk> , in the First Battle of <unk> . <unk> was killed , and the battle standard of the <unk> Guard was lost . The loss of the battle standard , or <unk> , was indicative of a crushing defeat and a serious <unk> to Roman national pride . 
 <unk> firmly believed in the traditional Roman religion , and personally saw to it that ancient customs and morals were observed throughout his reign . In order to justify the divine nature of the <unk> rule , <unk> emphasized connections with the chief deity Jupiter , perhaps most significantly through the impressive restoration of the Temple of Jupiter on the <unk> Hill . A small chapel dedicated to Jupiter <unk> was also constructed near the house where <unk> had fled to safety on 20 December 69 . Later in his reign , he replaced it with a more expansive building , dedicated to Jupiter <unk> . 
 The goddess he worshipped the most <unk> , however , was Minerva . Not only did he keep a personal shrine dedicated to her in his bedroom , she regularly appeared on his coinage — in four different attested reverse types — and he founded a legion , <unk> I <unk> , in her name . 
 Construction projects such as these constituted only the most visible part of <unk> 's religious policy , which also concerned itself with the <unk> of religious law and public morals . In 85 , he nominated himself perpetual censor , the office that held the task of supervising Roman morals and conduct . Once again , <unk> acquitted himself of this task <unk> , and with care . He renewed the Lex <unk> de <unk> <unk> , under which adultery was punishable by exile . From the list of jurors he struck an <unk> who had divorced his wife and taken her back , while an ex @-@ <unk> was expelled from the Senate for acting and dancing . 
 <unk> also heavily <unk> corruption among public officials , removing jurors if they accepted <unk> and <unk> legislation when a conflict of interest was suspected . He ensured that <unk> writings , especially those directed against himself , were punishable by exile or death . Actors were likewise regarded with suspicion , as their performances provided an opportunity for satire at the expense of the government . Consequently , he forbade <unk> from appearing on stage in public . 
 In 87 , <unk> <unk> were found to have broken their sacred vows of lifelong public chastity . As the <unk> were regarded as daughters of the community , this offense essentially constituted <unk> . Accordingly , those found guilty of any such <unk> were condemned to death , either by a manner of their choosing , or according to the ancient fashion , which dictated that <unk> should be buried alive . 
 Foreign religions were <unk> <unk> as they did not interfere with public order , or could be assimilated with the traditional Roman religion . The worship of Egyptian deities in particular flourished under the <unk> dynasty , to an extent not seen again until the reign of <unk> . <unk> of <unk> and Isis , who were identified with Jupiter and Minerva respectively , was especially prominent . 
 4th century writings by Eusebius of Caesarea maintain that Jews and Christians were heavily persecuted toward the end of <unk> 's reign . The Book of Revelation is thought by some to have been written during this period . Although Jews were heavily <unk> , no contemporary authors mention trials or executions based on religious offenses other than those within the Roman religion . 
 By a stroke of luck , a <unk> prevented the <unk> from crossing the Rhine and coming to <unk> ' aid . Within twenty @-@ four days the rebellion was crushed , and its leaders at <unk> <unk> punished . The <unk> <unk> were sent to the front in <unk> , while those who had assisted in their defeat were duly rewarded . 
 Although little is known about the life and career of <unk> before his accession as Emperor in 96 , he appears to have been a highly adaptable diplomat , surviving multiple regime changes and emerging as one of the <unk> ' most trusted advisors . His <unk> may therefore have been intended to emphasize the stability and status <unk> of the regime . The revolt had been suppressed and the Empire returned to order . 
 Since the fall of the Republic , the authority of the Roman Senate had largely eroded under the quasi @-@ <unk> system of government established by Augustus , known as the <unk> . The <unk> allowed the existence of a de facto dictatorial regime , while maintaining the formal framework of the Roman Republic . Most <unk> upheld the public facade of democracy , and in return the Senate implicitly acknowledged the Emperor 's status as a de facto monarch . 
 Some rulers handled this arrangement with less <unk> than others . <unk> was not so subtle . From the outset of his reign , he stressed the reality of his <unk> . He disliked <unk> and had no fear of showing it , withdrawing every decision @-@ making power from the Senate , and instead relying on a small set of friends and <unk> to control the important offices of state . 
 The dislike was mutual . After <unk> 's assassination , the <unk> of Rome rushed to the Senate house , where they immediately passed a motion condemning his memory to oblivion . Under the rulers of the <unk> @-@ <unk> dynasty , <unk> authors published histories that elaborated on the view of <unk> as a <unk> . 
 He used to say that the lot of <unk> was most unfortunate , since when they discovered a conspiracy , no one believed them unless they had been murdered . 
 Jones compares the executions of <unk> to those under Emperor Claudius ( 41 – 55 ) , noting that Claudius executed around 35 <unk> and 300 <unk> , and yet was still deified by the Senate and regarded as one of the good <unk> of history . <unk> was apparently unable to gain support among the aristocracy , despite attempts to appease hostile factions with <unk> appointments . His <unk> style of government <unk> the Senate 's loss of power , while his policy of treating <unk> and even family members as equals to all Romans earned him their contempt . 
 The precise involvement of the <unk> Guard is less clear . At the time the Guard was commanded by Titus <unk> <unk> and Titus <unk> <unk> and the latter was almost certainly aware of the plot . <unk> <unk> , writing nearly a hundred years after the assassination , includes <unk> <unk> among the conspirators , but in light of her attested devotion to <unk> — even years after her husband had died — her involvement in the plot seems highly unlikely . 
 <unk> further suggests that the assassination was improvised , while <unk> implies a well @-@ organized conspiracy . For some days before the attack took place , <unk> <unk> an injury so as to be able to conceal a <unk> beneath his bandages . On the day of the assassination the doors to the servants ' quarters were locked while <unk> 's personal weapon of last resort , a sword he concealed beneath his pillow , had been removed in advance . 
 In accordance with an <unk> prediction the Emperor believed that he would die around noon , and was therefore restless during this time of the day . On his last day , <unk> was feeling disturbed and asked a servant several times what time it was . The boy , included in the plot , <unk> , saying that it was much later than noon . More at ease , the Emperor went to his desk to sign some decrees , where he was suddenly approached by <unk> : 
 According to <unk> , a number of <unk> had <unk> <unk> 's death . Several days prior to the assassination , Minerva had appeared to him in a dream , announcing she had been disarmed by Jupiter and would no longer be able to protect him . 
 The <unk> <unk> , the <unk> Calendar , records that the same day the Senate proclaimed Marcus <unk> <unk> emperor . Despite his political experience , this was a remarkable choice . <unk> was old and <unk> , and had spent much of his career out of the public light , prompting both ancient and modern authors to speculate on his involvement in <unk> 's assassination . 
 According to <unk> <unk> , the conspirators approached <unk> as a potential successor prior to the assassination , suggesting that he was at least aware of the plot . He does not appear in <unk> ' version of the events , but this may be understandable , since his works were published under <unk> 's direct descendants Trajan and <unk> . To suggest the dynasty owed its accession to murder would have been less than sensitive . 
 On the other hand , <unk> lacked widespread support in the Empire , and as a known <unk> loyalist , his track record would not have recommended him to the conspirators . The precise facts have been obscured by history , but modern historians believe <unk> was proclaimed Emperor solely on the initiative of the Senate , within hours after the news of the assassination broke . The decision may have been hasty so as to avoid civil war , but neither appears to have been involved in the conspiracy . 
 According to <unk> , <unk> wholly <unk> his interest in arts and literature , and never bothered to <unk> himself with classic authors . Other passages , alluding to <unk> 's love of <unk> expression , suggest that he was in fact familiar with classic writers , while he also <unk> poets and architects , founded artistic Olympics , and personally restored the library of Rome at great expense after it had burned down . 
 De Vita <unk> is also the source of several <unk> stories regarding <unk> 's marriage life . According to <unk> , <unk> <unk> was exiled in 83 because of an affair with a famous actor named Paris . When <unk> found out , he allegedly murdered Paris in the street and promptly divorced his wife , with <unk> further adding that once <unk> was exiled , <unk> took Julia as his mistress , who later died during a failed abortion . 
 Modern historians consider this highly <unk> however , noting that malicious rumours such as those concerning <unk> 's alleged <unk> were eagerly repeated by post @-@ <unk> authors , and used to highlight the hypocrisy of a ruler publicly preaching a return to Augustan morals , while privately <unk> in excesses and presiding over a corrupt court . Nevertheless , the account of <unk> has dominated imperial historiography for centuries . 
 Hostile views of <unk> were <unk> until well into the early 20th century , before archeological and numismatic advances brought renewed attention to his reign , and necessitated a revision of the literary tradition established by <unk> and Pliny . In 1930 , Ronald <unk> argued a complete <unk> of <unk> 's financial policy , which had until then been largely viewed as a disaster , opening his paper with the following introduction : 
 The work of the <unk> and the use of common sense have done much to <unk> the influence of <unk> and Pliny and redeem the memory of <unk> from <unk> or oblivion . But much remains to be done . 
 <unk> 's foreign policy was realistic , rejecting <unk> warfare and negotiating peace at a time when Roman military tradition dictated aggressive conquest . His economic program , which was <unk> efficient , maintained the Roman currency at a standard it would never again achieve . <unk> of religious minorities , such as Jews and Christians , was non @-@ <unk> . <unk> 's government nonetheless exhibited totalitarian characteristics . As Emperor , he saw himself as the new Augustus , an enlightened <unk> destined to guide the Roman Empire into a new era of <unk> renaissance . 
 Religious , military and cultural propaganda fostered a cult of personality . He deified three of his family members and erected massive structures to commemorate the <unk> achievements . <unk> <unk> were celebrated in order to boost his image as a warrior @-@ emperor , but many of these were either <unk> or premature . By nominating himself perpetual censor , he sought to control public and private morals . 
 He became personally involved in all branches of the government and successfully <unk> corruption among public officials . The dark side of his <unk> power involved a restriction in freedom of speech , and an increasingly oppressive attitude toward the Roman Senate . He punished libel with exile or death and , due to his suspicious nature , increasingly accepted information from <unk> to bring false charges of treason if necessary . 
 Although contemporary historians vilified <unk> after his death , his administration provided the foundation for the <unk> of the peaceful 2nd century . His successors <unk> and Trajan were less restrictive , but in reality their policies differed little from <unk> 's . Much more than a " <unk> <unk> to the ... 1st century " the Roman Empire prospered between 81 and 96 , in a reign that Theodor <unk> described as the <unk> but intelligent <unk> of <unk> .

 The 18th Boat Race took place on the River Thames on 16 March 1861 . Held annually , The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge . The 1861 event , which featured the first ever non @-@ British competitor , suffered numerous interruptions from river traffic . Oxford won by 16 lengths . 
 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . The race was first held in 1829 , and since 1845 has taken place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions , having defeated Oxford by one length in the previous year 's race and led overall with ten wins to Oxford 's seven . 
 The challenge to race was sent from Oxford in the October term which was accepted by Cambridge . Both boats were built specifically for the race , Cambridge 's by Searle and Oxford 's by <unk> . Oxford were " occasionally looked after " by H. <unk> , who rowed in the 1860 race , and C. G. Lane who represented the Dark Blues in the 1858 and 1859 races . The race was <unk> by Joseph William <unk> who had rowed for Oxford twice in 1849 ( in the March and December races ) and the 1852 race . 
 The Cambridge crew weighed an average of 11 <unk> 4 @.@ <unk> lb ( 71 @.@ 9 kg ) , 0 @.@ <unk> pounds ( 0 @.@ 4 kg ) per rower more than their Dark Blue opposition . George Morrison returned to the Oxford crew , having rowed in the previous year 's race . Cambridge saw Chaytor , Blake , Coventry and Hall return . The race featured the first non @-@ British rower in the history of the event : William Robertson of <unk> College , Oxford was educated at <unk> Grammar School in Australia before representing the Dark Blues at number four . 
 As a result of strong winds and a large volume of land water running into the river , the race was re @-@ scheduled for <unk> . Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Middlesex station , handing the Surrey station to Oxford . The starter , Edward Searle , gave the command to start , with neither boat taking an early advantage . By the Star and Garter pub , Cambridge had edged ahead and <unk> to take a half @-@ length lead and by the Duke 's Head pub , the Light Blues had moved further in front . A steering error from Gaskell , the Cambridge <unk> , saw their lead eroded such that Oxford led by <unk> <unk> . At the football ground , rough water created by one of the nearby steamboats ( who , according to <unk> , had " <unk> put her <unk> @-@ wheels into motion " ) caused a swell to slow the Oxford boat . 
 The Dark Blue crew 's rhythm combined with more poor steering from Cambridge allowed Oxford to pull away , three lengths ahead by the Crab Tree and six by <unk> Bridge . Further <unk> to Cambridge 's passage came from a sailing barge which they forced to steer around , and by <unk> , they were ten lengths behind . Oxford suffered briefly at the hands of a barge blocking their route but by Barnes Bridge were at least twelve lengths ahead . They passed the flag boat ( indicating the finish of the race ) at the Ship Tavern in a time of 23 minutes 30 seconds , and a lead of 16 lengths . It was the largest winning margin since the 1841 race and would be the first in a series of nine consecutive victories for Oxford . 
 Tropical Storm Dean caused minor flooding along portions of the East Coast of the United States in September 1983 . The seventh tropical cyclone and fourth named storm the 1983 Atlantic hurricane season , Dean developed from a frontal low to the northeast of the Bahamas on September 26 . Initially subtropical , it gained characteristics of a tropical cyclone while tracking slowly north @-@ northeastward . By September 27 , the system was reclassified as Tropical Storm Dean . While tracking northward on September 28 , Dean peaked with winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) , shortly before curving west @-@ northwestward and slowly <unk> @-@ off in intensity . Eventually , Dean made landfall in Virginia on the <unk> Peninsula on September 29 as a weakening tropical storm . Dean rapidly weakened over land and was no longer <unk> as a tropical cyclone by early on October 1 . 
 Offshore Virginia , swells generated by the storm stranded a tugboat and injured two people . Waves along the coast also caused beach erosion , especially in Virginia and North Carolina . Inland , effects were minor and generally limited to mostly light rainfall . More than 100 <unk> on the Outer Banks of North Carolina were forced to evacuate due to flooding on North Carolina Highway 12 . Although near @-@ hurricane @-@ force wind gusts <unk> coastal areas of Virginia and North Carolina , wind damage from the storm was minimal . The remnants of the storm brought rainfall to portions of New England , especially to Connecticut , where precipitation from the storm peaked at 4 @.@ 62 in ( 117 mm ) . Damage from the storm was unknown , but presumed to be minimal . 
 A frontal cloud band moved offshore the East Coast of the United States on September 22 . During the next few days , the cloud band became stationary while stretching from The Bahamas to northeast of Bermuda . Around that time , a 1 @,@ <unk> mbar ( 30 @.@ 6 inHg ) high pressure stalled over the Northeastern United States , producing a strong pressure gradient and gale force winds over the East Coast of the United States . While located about <unk> mi ( <unk> km ) east of <unk> Beach , Florida , a low @-@ level circulation developed within the frontal cloud band on September 26 . At around 1800 UTC that day , the NHC classified the system as a subtropical storm , due to a ship report of gale force winds 230 mi ( 370 km ) from the center . Initially , it tracked north @-@ northeastward under the influence of the frontal cloud band that spawned the storm . The wind field quickly <unk> , while the storm itself separated from the frontal cloud band . As a result , it was re @-@ classified as Tropical Storm Dean at 1800 UTC on September 27 while approximately 575 mi ( <unk> km ) east of Jacksonville , Florida . The National Hurricane Center , which initiated advisories on the storm at <unk> UTC on the same day , indicated that a weak ridge to the north and a cold low moving offshore of the Southeastern United States would cause Dean to move slowly and possibly curve northwestward . 
 Early on September 28 , a reconnaissance aircraft recorded Dean 's minimum barometric pressure of 999 mbar ( 29 @.@ 5 inHg ) . Although forecast models initially indicated that the storm would continue northeastward , they quickly switched to a westward movement on September 29 . After curving northwestward later that day , Dean attained its maximum sustained wind speed of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) , as reported by a ship . While a reconnaissance aircraft flew into Dean north of center late on September 29 , it reported hurricane @-@ force wind gusts . However , the storm soon began to weaken . At around 1200 UTC on September 30 , Dean made landfall in Virginia on the <unk> Peninsula with winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) . Operationally , the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories four hours after Dean struck the state . At 1800 UTC on September 30 , the storm weakened to a tropical depression . At 0000 UTC on October 1 , Dean became <unk> as a tropical cyclone while located over Virginia near the mouth of the Potomac River . The remnants continued northwestward , before curving to the northeast while near the border of Virginia and West Virginia . It crossed the Mid @-@ Atlantic and New England before re @-@ emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near Boston , Massachusetts . By October 2 , the remnants of Dean had dissipated just offshore of the East Coast of the United States . 
 As Dean approached the United States , numerous gale warnings were issued . Many of these warnings were issued from North Carolina up to Rhode Island . Small craft advisories were also raised along much of the eastern seaboard , covering places between Cape Cod , Massachusetts to Jupiter Inlet , Florida . In Norfolk , Virginia , the naval station was placed under " hurricane condition 3 " , meaning that destructive winds were anticipated within 48 hours . In parts of North Carolina , residents were urged to prepare for the storm and remain out of the rough coastal waters . 
 As the storm moved inland over Virginia , its outer bands and high winds prompted more than 100 <unk> on <unk> Island and Cape Hatteras to evacuate after 1 ft ( 0 @.@ 30 m ) of water flooded North Carolina Highway 12 . Along the coast , wave between 6 and 10 ft ( 1 @.@ 8 and 3 @.@ 0 m ) were measured . Minor beach erosion ensued , although some beaches lost as much as 20 ft ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) of sand . <unk> lines associated with Dean brought near @-@ hurricane @-@ force wind gusts and brief , heavy rainfall . Winds caused little effect other than isolated power outages , especially on the Outer Banks . Aside from the minor damage caused by Dean , there was also a positive side to the storm . Throughout coastal waters off North Carolina , king <unk> appeared in near @-@ record numbers , improving the local fishing industry . Some catchers stated that they were finding some fish weighing up to 30 lb ( 14 kg ) . 
 About 300 mi ( 480 km ) off the coast of Virginia , large swells from Dean stranded a tugboat on September 29 with six people on board . Two of the crew were injured during the incident ; however , they were not seriously hurt . The ship was towed to Cape May , New Jersey later that day by the United States Coast Guard . Waves up to 8 ft ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) caused beach erosion across the Virginia coastline . In addition to minor erosion , waves caused " slight flooding " at <unk> Beach , totaling to $ 500 to $ 5 @,@ 000 in damage ( 1983 USD ) . Although winds were estimated to have been around 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) as the storm moved inland , structural damage was minimal . Many areas near Dean 's path experienced light rainfall of 1 to 3 in ( 25 to 76 mm ) of rain , especially in Virginia where the <unk> peak was 1 @.@ 29 in ( 33 mm ) in Richmond . 
 In Maryland , thousands of tons of sand was removed by rough seas near Ocean City ; beach erosion also occurred at nearby <unk> Island . Additionally , wind gusts between 50 and 55 mph ( 80 and 89 km / h ) resulted in minor damage , while minimal flooding was reported following rainfall . Damage in Maryland was light , totaling to between $ 500 and $ 5 @,@ 000 ( 1983 USD ) . Minor effects were reported in Delaware , limited to winds gusts up to 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) , which caused the loss of tons of sand along beaches . In coastal New Jersey , locally heavy rainfall resulted in traffic jams , downed power lines , and numerous <unk> problems . In some areas of New York , especially in the southeastern portions of the state , rainfall exceeding 2 in ( 51 mm ) in 24 hours flooded roadways and delayed trains . The remnants of Dean dropped light precipitation in New England . Rainfall from the storm peaked at 4 @.@ 62 in ( 117 mm ) at the <unk> Ranger Station in Connecticut . 
 The 1869 Atlantic hurricane season was the earliest season in the Atlantic hurricane database in which there were at least ten tropical cyclones . Initially there were only three known storms in the year , but additional research uncovered the additional storms . <unk> Christopher <unk> estimates up to six storms may remain missing from the official database for each season in this era , due to small tropical cyclone size , sparse ship reports , and relatively unpopulated <unk> . All activity occurred in a three @-@ month period between the middle of August and early October . 
 Out of the ten tropical storms , seven reached hurricane intensity , of which four made landfall on the United States . The strongest hurricane was a Category 3 on the modern @-@ day Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale which struck New England at that intensity , one of four storms to do so . It left heavy damage , killing at least one person . The most notable hurricane of the season was the <unk> Gale , which was predicted nearly a year in advance . The hurricane was one of six to produce hurricane force winds in Maine , where it left heavy damage and flooding . The <unk> Gale left 37 deaths along its path , with its destruction greatest along the Bay of <unk> ; there , the hurricane produced a 70 @.@ 9 ft ( 21 @.@ 6 m ) high tide near the head of the bay . 
 The first tropical cyclone of the season was observed on August 12 , about 500 mi ( 800 km ) southeast of Cape Race , Newfoundland . Its entire track was unknown , and its existence was only confirmed for 24 hours , based on three ship reports . The second , a barque , the <unk> Frederik Carl , sustained damage to all of its sails . The Hurricane Research Division ( <unk> ) assessed the storm to have moved northeastward in its limited duration , and based on the ship reports estimated peak winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) ; this would make it a Category 2 hurricane on the modern @-@ day Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale . 
 By August 16 , a strong hurricane was located in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico south of Louisiana . With estimated winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) , it tracked westward and struck Texas on Matagorda Island before passing near <unk> . The hurricane quickly weakened over land and dissipated late on August 17 . Damage from the hurricane was heaviest in <unk> and <unk> . In the latter city , strong waves damaged wharves and boats while the storm surge flooded the streets with about 1 ft ( 0 @.@ 30 m ) of water . <unk> winds knocked down several houses as well as a church , and many buildings lost their roofs . In Sabine Pass , the winds ruined a variety of fruit crops . 
 The third hurricane of the season was only known due to it affecting one ship . A vessel in the Royal Mail Steam <unk> Company reported a hurricane on August 27 , about halfway between Bermuda and the Azores . The storm was estimated to have been moving north @-@ northwestward with winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) , although its entire track is unknown . 
 A tropical storm was first observed on September 1 to the east of the Bahamas . There , it left heavy damage to a brig sailing from Nassau to New York . The storm tracked generally northeastward , damaging another ship on September 2 near Bermuda . 
 On September 4 , a hurricane was located in the northern Gulf of Mexico , moving north @-@ northwestward . The next day , it moved ashore in southeastern Louisiana with winds estimated at 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) , passing west of New Orleans . It dissipated early on September 6 . The hurricane dropped heavy rainfall along its path that caused flooding . In addition , strong winds uprooted trees and damaged fences . High tides flooded Grand Isle with 2 ft ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) of water . 
 On September 7 , three ships observed hurricane force winds over the western Atlantic Ocean , between the Bahamas and Bermuda . The storm moved northward , impacting several other ships as it paralleled the east coast of the United States ; one of them reported a pressure of <unk> mbar ( 28 @.@ 24 inHg ) , which indicated the system was an intense hurricane . Late on September 8 , it reached a peak intensity of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) with a pressure of 950 mbar ( 28 @.@ 05 inHg ) . After <unk> Long Island , the hurricane weakened slightly and made landfall on southwestern Rhode Island at peak intensity . It was one of four hurricanes , along with the 1938 New England hurricane , the 1944 Great Atlantic hurricane , and Hurricane Carol in 1954 , to strike New England as a major hurricane , or Category 3 or higher on the Saffir @-@ Simpson scale . 
 At landfall , the hurricane was compact , estimated around 60 mi ( 97 km ) wide . However , less than 10 miles ( 16 km ) west of the center , there were no strong winds . The hurricane produced a storm surge of 8 ft ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) , which was <unk> due to it moving ashore at low tide . In Providence , Rhode Island , high waves damaged coastal wharves and left flooding . The hurricane weakened quickly over land , passing just west of Boston early on September 9 as a minimal hurricane . There , the winds downed many trees and left severe damage . All telegraph lines between New York and Boston were cut , although the storm did produce beneficial heavy rainfall . Shortly thereafter it dissipated over Maine . There was one confirmed death in Massachusetts . Offshore Maine , a schooner capsized , killing all but one in the crew . 
 A ship about halfway between South America and Cape Verde reported a hurricane on September 11 . The storm tracked generally west @-@ northwestward , affecting several other ships with damaging winds . On September 15 , a ship traveling from St. Thomas to England encountered the hurricane and observed a minimum barometric pressure of 979 mbar ( 28 @.@ 90 inHg ) ; this suggested peak winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) . By September 16 the hurricane had weakened slightly as its track turned to the north and northeast . It was last observed on September 18 to the west of the Azores as a tropical storm . 
 The only basis for identifying the eighth tropical cyclone of the season was from a report by the bark Crescent Wave . On September 14 , the ship encountered strong winds and heavy rainfall about halfway between the Lesser Antilles and Cape Verde . At the time , the storm was at least 600 mi ( 970 km ) east of the previous hurricane . 
 On October 1 , the brig Jenny observed " a <unk> gale lasting 3 days " off the south coast of Puerto Rico , which indicated a tropical storm in the region . Despite being located near several islands in the Caribbean , no land stations experienced any effects from the storm . 
 The final hurricane of the season was first observed on October 4 by a ship off the southeast coast of North Carolina . With winds estimated at 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) , the storm tracked northeastward , passing just east of Martha 's <unk> before moving across Cape Cod late on October 4 . As it moved along the coast , the storm produced heavy precipitation , reaching 12 @.@ 25 in ( 311 mm ) in <unk> , Connecticut . The strongest winds did not affect Massachusetts , although a few hours later the hurricane struck just east of Portland , Maine at peak intensity . This made it one of six storms to produce hurricane @-@ force winds in Maine , along with Hurricane Carol in 1953 , Hurricane Edna in 1954 , Hurricane <unk> in 1960 , Hurricane <unk> in 1969 , and Hurricane Gloria in 1985 . In Maine , the high rainfall caused widespread flooding , while the high winds destroyed at least 90 houses . The hurricane quickly weakened over land , and after turning northeastward into Atlantic Canada dissipated on October 5 near the Gulf of St. Lawrence . 
 The hurricane was referred as <unk> 's Gale after Lieutenant <unk> <unk> of the Royal Navy predicted in November 1868 that an unusually violent storm would produce very high tides on October 5 ; he did not specify the location , however . Although heavy damage occurred in New England , the devastation was greatest in Atlantic Canada along the Bay of <unk> . The hurricane produced a storm surge of around 7 ft ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) , which , in combination with the winds , the low pressure , and being in a region of naturally occurring high tides , produced a 70 @.@ 9 ft ( 21 @.@ 6 m ) high tide near the head of the bay . The high tides surpassed the <unk> across New Brunswick and left widespread flooding , killing many cattle and sheep and <unk> away roads . In the <unk> Basin , the floods washed two boats about 3 mi ( 5 km ) inland . In <unk> , water levels rose about 6 @.@ 6 ft ( 2 m ) higher than the previous highest level . There were 37 deaths between Maine , New Brunswick , and New York . 
 <unk> was a daughter of <unk> Ua Briain , High King of Ireland ( died 1119 ) . In the late eleventh century , following the death of his father , <unk> seized control of the Kingdom of Munster and moved to extend his authority throughout Ireland as High King of Ireland . In so doing , he gained control of the Norse @-@ Gaelic Kingdom of Dublin , and as a result began to extend his influence into the nearby Kingdom of the Isles . There is uncertainty concerning the political situation in the Isles in the last decade of the eleventh century . What is known for sure is that , before the end of the century , <unk> <unk> , King of Norway ( died 1103 ) led a <unk> fleet from Scandinavia into the Irish Sea region , where he held power until his death in 1103 . 
 The <unk> @-@ class battleship was a class of six pre @-@ dreadnought battleships built for the French Navy ( Marine <unk> ) before World War I. The ships were assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet after commissioning in 1911 . After the beginning of World War I in early August 1914 , five of the sister ships participated in the Battle of <unk> . They spent most of the rest of the war blockading the Straits of Otranto and the Dardanelles to prevent warships of the Central Powers from breaking out into the Mediterranean . One ship was sunk by a German submarine in 1917 . 
 The remaining five ships were obsolescent by the end of the war and most were assigned to secondary roles . Two of the sisters were sent to the Black Sea to support the Whites during the Russian Civil War . One ship ran aground and the crew of the other mutinied after one of its members was killed during a protest against intervention in support of the Whites . Both ships were quickly condemned and later sold for scrap . The remaining three sisters received partial <unk> in the mid @-@ 1920s and became training ships until they were condemned in the mid @-@ 1930s and later scrapped . The only survivor still afloat at the beginning of World War II in August 1939 had been <unk> in 1931 and was serving as part of the navy 's torpedo school . She was captured by the Germans when they occupied <unk> France in 1942 and scuttled by them after the Allied invasion of southern France in 1944 . 
 The <unk> @-@ class ships were ordered as the second <unk> of a French naval expansion plan that began in response to the growth of the Imperial German Navy after 1900 . <unk> began in 1905 for an enlarged version of the preceding <unk> @-@ class design . French analyses of the Russian defeat by the Japanese at the Battle of <unk> in May 1905 credited the latter 's victory to the large number of medium @-@ caliber hits that heavily damaged the <unk> of the Russian ships and started many fires that the crews had difficulty <unk> . The superior speed and handling of the Japanese ships was also credited with a role in their victory . 
 The French decided that the increasing range of naval combat dictated the use of the 240 @-@ millimeter ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) gun in lieu of the 194 @-@ millimeter ( 7 @.@ 6 in ) gun used on the <unk> class as the larger gun had a greater ability to penetrate armor at longer ranges while still having a good rate of fire . The navy also wanted a faster ship , but this could only be done by reducing armor <unk> without exceeding the 18 @,@ 000 metric tons ( 18 @,@ 000 long tons ) limit imposed by the Minister of the Navy , <unk> Thomson , for <unk> reasons . A preliminary design with the usual triple @-@ expansion steam engines was accepted in March 1906 , but various modifications were requested . One proposal was made to replace the 240 @-@ millimeter guns turrets with single 305 @-@ millimeter ( 12 in ) turrets to create an " all @-@ big @-@ gun " ship , like the British battleship HMS <unk> , but this was rejected as it would have raised the displacement above the 18 @,@ 000 @-@ metric ton limit and the slower @-@ firing 305 @-@ millimeter guns would have reduced the volume and weight of fire to an unacceptable degree . 
 The design was estimated to displace 18 @,@ <unk> tonnes ( 18 @,@ <unk> long tons ) before the adoption of the heavier <unk> 1906 gun required a new and larger turret to handle the gun which meant that the turret 's supporting structure also had to be reinforced . In an unsuccessful bid to reduce the displacement , many sections of armor were reduced in thickness , but the ships exceeded even the design estimate as built . 
 The <unk> were significantly larger than their predecessors of the <unk> class . The ships were 145 meters ( <unk> ft 9 in ) long at the waterline and 146 @.@ 6 meters ( <unk> ft 0 in ) long overall , over 13 meters ( 42 ft 8 in ) longer than the earlier ships . They had a beam of 25 @.@ 8 meters ( 84 ft 8 in ) and a draft of 8 @.@ 44 meters ( 27 ft 8 in ) at deep load . The <unk> @-@ class ships were slightly overweight ; they actually displaced 18 @,@ 754 metric tons ( 18 @,@ <unk> long tons ) at normal load . This was over 4 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 3 @,@ 900 long tons ) more than the earlier ships . When serving as <unk> , their crew consisted of 40 officers and <unk> enlisted men . Without an admiral and his staff embarked , the crew numbered 28 officers and <unk> enlisted men . 
 The <unk> @-@ class ships had four license @-@ built Parsons direct @-@ drive steam turbines , each of which drove a single propeller , using steam from 26 coal @-@ fired Belleville or <unk> boilers . Each boiler type was installed on three ships of the class . The boilers were housed in two large compartments , 17 in the forward boiler room that used the three forward funnels and 9 in the aft boiler which exhausted through the rear pair of funnels . The <unk> were amidships , between the boiler rooms , in three compartments . The center engine room housed the turbines for the two center propeller shafts and the turbine for each of the outer shafts had their own compartment flanking the center engine room . The turbines were rated at a total of 22 @,@ 500 shaft horsepower ( 16 @,@ 800 kW ) using steam provided by the boilers at a working pressure of 18 kg / <unk> ( 1 @,@ <unk> <unk> ; 256 <unk> ) . Designed for a maximum speed of 19 @.@ 25 knots ( 35 @.@ 65 km / h ; 22 @.@ 15 mph ) , they <unk> exceeded that during their sea trials with speeds ranging from 19 @.@ 7 to 20 @.@ 66 knots ( 36 @.@ 5 to 38 @.@ 3 km / h ; 22 @.@ 7 to 23 @.@ 8 mph ) . 
 The <unk> boilers were not well suited for use with turbines and burned more coal than the Belleville boilers . They also produced copious amounts of smoke and sparks ; occasionally even flames from incomplete combustion of the coal . The <unk> carried a maximum of 2 @,@ <unk> tonnes ( 1 @,@ 995 long tons ) of coal which gave them an estimated range from 3 @,@ 120 – 4 @,@ <unk> nautical miles ( 5 @,@ <unk> – 9 @,@ <unk> km ; 3 @,@ 590 – 5 @,@ 600 mi ) at a speed of 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) , depending on which boilers were fitted . Their endurance was almost half that of their predecessors due to the <unk> fuel consumption of their turbines at low speeds and meant that they needed frequent coaling stops during the war . 
 The main battery of the <unk> @-@ class ships consisted of four 305 mm <unk> 1906 guns mounted in two twin @-@ gun turrets , one each fore and aft of the superstructure . Each turret could elevate up to + 12 ° that gave the guns a maximum range of 14 @,@ 500 meters ( 15 @,@ 900 yd ) . The guns fired 440 @-@ kilogram ( 970 lb ) armour @-@ piercing projectiles at a muzzle velocity of 780 m / s ( 2 @,@ 600 ft / s ) at a rate of 1 @.@ 5 rounds per minute . Each turret stored eight rounds along the rear wall and their propellant was kept between the floor of the firing chamber and the bottom of the turret . The ships normally <unk> 75 rounds per gun , but space was available for an additional 10 rounds . Their secondary armament consisted of twelve <unk> / 50 <unk> 1902 guns in six twin @-@ gun turrets , three on each side of the ship . Maximum elevation of the turrets was + 13 ° and the 240 @-@ kilogram ( <unk> lb ) shell could be fired to a range of 14 @,@ 000 meters ( 15 @,@ 000 yd ) . The guns could fire at a rate of two rounds per minute . Each turret had space for 12 shells and the necessary 36 propellant charges ; 80 rounds per gun was normally carried , but maximum capacity was 100 rounds per gun . 
 The <unk> carried a number of smaller guns to defend themselves against torpedo boats . These included sixteen 75 @-@ millimeter ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) <unk> 1908 Schneider guns mounted in <unk> <unk> in the hull sides . These guns had a range of 8 @,@ 000 meters ( 8 @,@ 700 yd ) and could fire approximately 15 rounds per minute . Because the shell hoists were slow and the shells difficult to handle in their three @-@ round cases in the magazines , a total of 576 rounds were stored close to the guns in ready @-@ use <unk> . Each gun was provided with 400 rounds , but the maximum storage available was 430 rounds per gun . The ships also mounted ten 47 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) <unk> guns in <unk> mounts on the superstructure . They had the same rate of fire as the larger 75 mm guns , but only a range of 6 @,@ 000 meters ( 6 @,@ 600 yd ) . Each gun had 36 rounds nearby in ready @-@ use <unk> and the ships were provided with a maximum of 800 rounds per gun . 
 The battleships were also armed with two submerged 450 @-@ millimeter ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes , one on each broadside . Each tube was angled 10 ° forward and 3 ° downward . Each ship carried six <unk> <unk> torpedoes . They had a 114 @-@ kilogram ( 251 lb ) warhead and two speed / range settings : 3 @,@ 000 meters ( 3 @,@ 300 yd ) at 28 knots ( 52 km / h ; 32 mph ) or 2 @,@ 000 meters ( 2 @,@ 200 yd ) at 33 knots ( 61 km / h ; 38 mph ) . The <unk> also had storage space for 10 <unk> <unk> 1906 mines , which had an explosive charge of 60 kilograms ( 130 lb ) of <unk> . These could not be laid by the ships themselves , but had to be off @-@ loaded for use . 
 Finding the British <unk> & Stroud coincidence rangefinder design superior to existing French designs , the <unk> mounted a pair of 2 @-@ meter ( 6 ft 7 in ) <unk> rangefinders atop the conning tower and a 1 @.@ 37 @-@ meter ( 4 ft 6 in ) rangefinder on each turret top for use by the turret commanders . <unk> these into the overall fire @-@ control system took some time so eight <unk> & <unk> <unk> , which required knowledge of the target 's mast height and overall length , were used in the interim . During the war , the rangefinders were replaced by longer , more precise instrument . A triple 4 @.@ 57 @-@ meter ( 15 ft 0 in ) model was installed above the conning tower and 2 @-@ meter models replaced the smaller ones on the turret roofs . 
 The <unk> @-@ class ships were built with 6 @,@ 725 metric tons ( 6 @,@ <unk> long tons ) of armor , 36 percent of their designed displacement and almost 1 @,@ 200 metric tons ( 1 @,@ 200 long tons ) more than their predecessors . Their waterline armored belt had a maximum thickness of 250 millimeters ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) between the fore and aft turrets that reduced to 180 millimeters ( 7 @.@ 1 in ) towards the bow and stern . The belt consisted of two <unk> of armor , 4 @.@ 5 meters ( 14 ft 9 in ) high , that covered the sides of the hull up to the main deck and extended 1 @.@ 1 m ( 3 ft 7 in ) below the normal waterline . Most of the lower armor plates tapered to a thickness of 80 – 100 millimeters ( 3 @.@ 1 – 3 @.@ 9 in ) along their bottom edge and the upper plates tapered to 220 millimeters ( 8 @.@ 7 in ) amidships and down to 140 millimeters ( 5 @.@ 5 in ) at the ends of the ship . The belt armour was backed by 80 millimeters ( 3 @.@ 1 in ) of <unk> . It extended almost the entire length of the ship , with only the very stern unprotected . At the stern , the belt terminated in a 200 @-@ millimeter ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) transverse bulkhead ; the forward 154 @-@ millimeter ( 6 @.@ 1 in ) transverse bulkhead connected the sides of the forward barbette to the belt . 
 The main gun turrets had 340 millimeters ( 13 @.@ 4 in ) of armor on their faces , 260 @-@ millimeter ( 10 in ) sides , and roofs of three layers of 24 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 94 in ) mild @-@ steel plates . Their barbettes were protected by <unk> millimeters ( 9 @.@ 7 in ) of armor which <unk> to 66 millimeters ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) below the upper protected deck . The secondary gun turrets had 225 @-@ millimeter ( 8 @.@ 9 in ) faces , 188 @-@ millimeter ( 7 @.@ 4 in ) sides , and a roof of three layers of 17 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 67 in ) plates . The 240 @-@ millimeter turret barbettes had sides 154 to 148 millimeters ( 6 @.@ 1 to 5 @.@ 8 in ) . The front of the conning tower had armour 266 millimeters ( 10 @.@ 5 in ) thick and its sides were 216 millimeters ( 8 @.@ 5 in ) . The walls of its communication tube down to the fire @-@ control center ( <unk> central de <unk> ) were 200 millimeters thick down to the upper protected deck . 
 The <unk> took a long time to build . Construction was prolonged by a number of factors , chief of which were the 500 plus changes were made to the original design and in the inability of <unk> to make a timely decision . This meant that the builders sometimes had to rip out already completed sections to incorporate the modifications . Other problems were shortages of necessary infrastructure at the shipyards , lengthy delays in delivery of parts , and labor shortages and a lack of building slips in the naval dockyards . For example , water in the lower end of the newly completed Point @-@ du @-@ <unk> slip at Brest meant that building <unk> 's stern was delayed four months after the bow began and construction of <unk> could not begin until the armored cruiser <unk> @-@ <unk> was launched . 
 After commissioning in 1911 , all six ships were assigned to the First Battle Squadron ( <unk> <unk> de ligne ) of the Mediterranean Fleet where they participated in the fleet maneuvers in May – June 1913 . When the war began , the squadron , under the command of Vice Admiral Paul <unk> , was at sea preparing to escort troop convoys from French North Africa to France . Some of the ships unsuccessfully searched for the German battlecruiser SMS Goeben and the light cruiser SMS Breslau in the Western Mediterranean and escorted convoys . Later that month , all of the ships , except <unk> , participated in the Battle of <unk> in the Adriatic Sea and helped to sink an Austro @-@ Hungarian protected cruiser . They spent most of the rest of the war blockading the Straits of Otranto and the Dardanelles to prevent German , Austro @-@ Hungarian and Turkish warships from breaking out . <unk> participated in the attempt to ensure Greek <unk> to Allied operations in Macedonia in late 1916 . 
 <unk> , <unk> and <unk> briefly participated in the occupation of Constantinople after the end of the war and the latter two ships were sent to the Black Sea in early 1919 during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War . <unk> 's crew mutinied after one of its members was killed when a protest against intervention in support of the Whites was <unk> suppressed and forced the return of the French ships supporting the Whites . <unk> ran aground in February 1919 off the coast of the <unk> and could not be <unk> until some of her guns and armor were removed . 
 All of the surviving ships except <unk> were reduced to second @-@ line roles by 1920 . <unk> was not repaired after her salvage and was <unk> for a few years before being sold . <unk> was in bad shape and became a target ship before she was sold for scrap . <unk> and <unk> had their underwater protection modernized in the early 1920s and became training ships before they were condemned in the mid @-@ 1930s . <unk> was assigned to the Channel Division in the early 1920s before she too had her underwater protection modernized . She also became a training ship after its completion , but she was <unk> in 1931 and became a depot ship for the torpedo school . The ship was captured intact when the Germans occupied Toulon in November 1942 and was used by them as a barracks ship . <unk> was scuttled by the Germans in August 1944 and <unk> the following year before being scrapped . 
 <unk> 's wreck was discovered in 2007 between Algeria and Sardinia at a depth of over 1 @,@ 000 meters ( 3 @,@ 300 ft ) . 
 <unk> . <unk> <unk> , <unk> ( born 1968 ) is a Czech economist , politician , and <unk> . He led successful corruption cases against the Czech National Property Fund and the Environment Ministry as former employees of both . He is the first Pirate Party candidate to be elected to office in a national legislature . His <unk> term is 2012 – 2018 . 
 At the end of July 2012 , <unk> <unk> accepted the Czech Pirate , Green , and Christian Democrat Party <unk> nominations for District 26 . The Pirate Party was his primary affiliation due to its transparency and accountability platforms . His personal 12 @-@ point platform <unk> direct democracy , fair political party competition , and anti @-@ corruption oversight efforts alongside social welfare reforms . In the October 2012 elections , he won 24 @.@ 3 percent of the first round vote and 74 @.@ 4 percent of the first @-@ past @-@ the @-@ post runoff , giving him the seat . Another candidate , Karel <unk> , challenged the decision , but the Czech Supreme Administrative Court found the claims unfounded . He was the first Pirate Party candidate to be elected to national office , the 81 @-@ seat Czech Senate . His <unk> term is 2012 – 2018 . 
 Czech President <unk> <unk> has publicly considered <unk> for leading the Supreme <unk> Office . In 2013 , <unk> authored the first bill designed to protect <unk> , which was overwhelming rejected on the floor of the Senate . 
 In March 2011 , <unk> was awarded first prize from the <unk> Fund Against <unk> for his <unk> role in the Environment Ministry corruption scandal . In May 2011 , he was awarded the <unk> <unk> Prize by the Charter 77 Foundation for his " brave , consistent and uncompromising fight against corruption in government . " 
 Dangerously in Love is the debut studio album by American recording artist Beyoncé . It was released on June 24 , 2003 by Columbia Records . During the recording of Destiny 's Child 's third studio album , Survivor ( 2001 ) , the group announced that they would produce solo albums to be released . Recording sessions for the album took place from March 2002 to March 2003 at several studios , during the hiatus of her then @-@ group Destiny 's Child . As executive producer of the album , Beyoncé took a wider role in its production , co @-@ writing a majority of the songs , choosing which ones to produce and sharing ideas on the mixing and mastering of tracks . 
 The tracks in the album are a mixture of <unk> and ballads , which are basically inspired by R & B and soul genres ; it also features elements of hip hop and Arabic music . Although Beyoncé remained discreet about her interpretation of the songs , its underlying meanings were attributed by music writers as an allusion to her intimate relationship with then @-@ boyfriend and well @-@ known music <unk> Jay @-@ Z. Dangerously in Love received positive reviews from music critics upon its release , with critics praising Knowles ' " artistic leap " . The album also received numerous accolades , earning Beyoncé five Grammy Awards . 
 Dangerously in Love propelled Beyoncé in becoming a viable solo star , as well as one of the most <unk> singers in the recording industry . It became a worldwide commercial success , earning multi @-@ platinum certifications in Australia , the United Kingdom , and the United States . The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart , selling 317 @,@ 000 copies in its first week , earning Beyoncé the highest debut sales among Destiny 's Child members ' solo albums . Dangerously in Love has sold over 5 million copies in the United States as of 2016 and an estimated 11 million copies worldwide as of 2011 , and has produced two number one Billboard singles and multiple top tens . 
 Beyoncé launched her career as lead singer to R & B group Destiny 's Child in the late 1990s . According to Corey Moss of MTV News , " fans are eager to see " how Beyoncé , after years with the group , performs solo . While recording their third album , Survivor , in late 2000 , Beyoncé announced the group would be put on hiatus in order for the members to produce solo albums in the coming years , which they hoped would boost interest in Destiny 's Child . The idea of individual releases <unk> from the group 's manager and Beyoncé 's father , <unk> . 
 With different types of music for each member to produce , the albums were not intended to compete on the charts . Destiny 's Child 's management strategically planned to <unk> the release of each group member 's album to <unk> sales . Michelle Williams was the first to release a debut solo album , Heart to Yours , in April 2002 . Meanwhile , Beyoncé debuted on the big screen , starring in the comedy film Austin Powers in <unk> , and recorded her debut single , " Work It Out " , which is featured on the soundtrack to the film . Rowland collaborated with American rapper Nelly on the song " <unk> " as a featured artist ; it became a hit that year , leading the label to advance the release date of her debut solo album , <unk> Deep , in late 2002 . Beyoncé also starred in The Fighting Temptations and recorded another solo single . In August 2002 , she collaborated with boyfriend Jay @-@ Z as featured vocalist on the song " ' 03 Bonnie & Clyde " . The single earned Beyoncé credibility and paved the way for the release of Dangerously in Love . 
 Before Beyoncé began recording for Dangerously in Love , she selected the producers with whom she would collaborate . For two days , she held meetings with prospective producers from the West Coast across the East Coast , and had interviews with them . Beyoncé went to Miami , Florida to begin sessions with Canadian record producer Scott <unk> , her first collaborator , and lived in a Miami hotel in the following months . As she wanted to concentrate on the album , Beyoncé took her time to avoid pressure build @-@ up , significantly different from the hasty productions of Destiny 's Child . 
 As she did on Survivor , Beyoncé took a wider role in the production of Dangerously in Love , co @-@ writing a majority of the songs , choosing which ones to produce and sharing ideas on the mixing and mastering of tracks . Although Beyoncé did not create beats , she came up with melodies and ideas she shared with the producers . With 43 songs completed — 15 of which made it to the album — Beyoncé is credited as co @-@ writer and co @-@ producer , as well as the album 's executive producer alongside Matthew Knowles . 
 Beyoncé felt that recording an album without her group mates was " liberating and therapeutic " , coming into the studio and freely expressing her ideas with her collaborators . The dependency she developed with Destiny 's Child , however , meant it was harder " to be on [ her ] own creatively " . As she wanted to grow as an artist Beyoncé contacted other artists with a view to forming a collaborative partnership . When the collective finished writing several songs , she printed copies of each and sent them to prospective guest artists . She talked to them by phone for possible collaboration , eventually gaining their approval . Besides Jay @-@ Z , Beyoncé was able to work with Jamaican artist Sean Paul , American rapper Missy Elliott , among others . In contrast , some artists sent copies of songs to Beyoncé , which were eventually produced . Additionally , Beyoncé also worked with Timbaland and Missy Elliott on a track titled " Wrapped Around Me " for the album . Eventually , however , for reasons unknown , the song failed to appear on the album . 
 Dangerously in Love was originally a song of the same title which Beyoncé had written for Survivor . The song was deemed too sophisticated compared to other songs on Survivor , and the group decided not to release it as a single off the album . After recording several tracks for Dangerously in Love , Beyoncé decided to add " Dangerously in Love " , after realizing that it fit the <unk> theme of the album . Since the album 's release date was postponed to capitalize on the success of " <unk> " , Beyoncé had been offered the chance to further enhance the album . Although she was disappointed with the move , Beyoncé realized that " everything happens for a reason " , agreeing to return to the recording studio to work with other songwriters . This allowed her to record more songs , including the album 's lead single , " Crazy in Love " . In late 2002 , Beyoncé paused working on Dangerously in Love for a holiday tour with Destiny 's Child . With a few weeks left for recording in March 2003 , Beyoncé was still <unk> with other guests on the album , including Sean Paul and P. <unk> . 
 Beyoncé 's mother @-@ manager said that Dangerously in Love showcases her musical roots . While Williams and Rowland were on gospel and alternative pop , respectively , Beyoncé focused on recording R & B songs . Songs in the album are varied : from mid @-@ tempo and club @-@ oriented tracks in the first half , and ballads in the second half . Beyoncé commented : " My album is a good balance of ... ballads and ... mid @-@ <unk> with just <unk> ' <unk> @-@ your @-@ car feels , to a lot of ... up @-@ tempo club songs , to really sexy songs , to songs that make you feel emotional . It 's a nice mixture of different types of tracks . " Although the album contains high @-@ energy songs like " Crazy in Love " and " Naughty Girl " , the album 's focal mode , however , is slow and moody . Beyoncé said that she had written lots of ballads for the album . According to Beyoncé , she wanted to be understood as an artist and showcase her range , and by doing so , she blended various genres and musical influences in the album . The album incorporates R & B , hip hop , soul and reggae influences . The album took hip hop influences from Jay @-@ Z , <unk> , and Lil ' Kim ; the reggae is from Sean Paul ; and courtesy of <unk> , the album explores Arabic music . His personal study of that kind of music gave the album a Middle Eastern vibe . Beyoncé and the producers also used a wide array of <unk> . 
 When " ' 03 Bonnie & Clyde " was released as a single in late 2002 , critics and the public had speculated that Beyoncé and Jay @-@ Z were having a mutual affair . Despite widespread rumors , they remained silent about their relationship . According to critics , the title itself of the album sounded " more intriguing " with Beyoncé singing personal songs . Though love is the theme Beyoncé had incorporated in the album , " most the material is vague enough to be about any relationship " ; however , there are songs that suggested affirmation of their relationship . In the song " Signs " , Beyoncé sings about being in love with a <unk> , which <unk> is Jay @-@ Z 's <unk> sign . In response to the persistent rumors about them , Beyoncé stated , " People can come to whatever conclusion they like ... That 's the beauty of music ... I 'm a singer , I 'll talk about writing songs all you want . But when it comes to certain personal things any normal person wouldn 't tell people they don 't know , I just feel like I don 't have to [ talk about it ] . " 
 Beyoncé said that Dangerously in Love is lyrically similar to Destiny 's Child 's albums . But because she only had to write for herself , Beyoncé had the chance to compose personally deeper songs than her previous records with the group . With a theme that is based upon different stages of a romantic relationship , Dangerously in Love contains songs that speak of love and honesty . In addition , Beyoncé admitted that there are songs about love @-@ making . The personal content of the album , however , was not generally attributed to Beyoncé 's own experiences — although some were based from hers — instead , the theme kept recurring in her mind . Beyoncé later explained : " I wanted to have an album that everyone could relate to and would listen to as long as I 'm alive and even after ... Love is something that never goes out of style . It 's something everybody experiences , and if they are not in love , people usually want to feel that ... " While some songs merely focus on the " beauty of love " , the album also explores another side of love , with songs that " celebrate breakup " and songs that narrate a woman 's desire to have a degree of control in a relationship . The album 's hidden track , " Daddy " , is a tribute to Beyoncé 's father , <unk> Knowles , who fronted Destiny 's Child as their manager . The song is an account of Beyoncé wanting her future husband and child to possess qualities similar to her father 's . Originally , Beyoncé did not intend to include the track in the album , having thought its lyrics would make her appear immature . However , considering it one of the songs that reflected her life at that transitional moment , she instead relegated " Daddy " as the closing track . 
 Beyoncé said that she had trouble convincing executives at Columbia Records to release the album . The singer recounted that it almost was not released : " In 2003 , I had my first solo album . But when I played it through for my record label , they told me I didn 't have one hit on my album . I guess they were <unk> right , I had five . ' Dangerously In Love ' , ' Naughty Girl ' , ' Me , Myself and I ' , ' Baby Boy ' and ' Crazy In Love ' . " Since " <unk> " was concurrently charting atop the Billboard Hot 100 , Beyoncé 's management released , " Work It Out " , one of the songs on the soundtrack to Austin Powers in <unk> , instead of a single from Dangerously in Love to preclude it from possibly competing with the former . 
 From the original release date of October 2002 , the album was pushed to December in the same year , and to May in the following year . Beyoncé recorded a version of " In da Club " , and served its way to <unk> before its original release date . The single failed to dominate as a " <unk> favorite " ; <unk> Knowles , however , confirmed that it was just a " <unk> cut " and was not included in the album . Nonetheless , it earned enough airplay to appear on the Billboard Hot R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Singles & Tracks chart . While Beyoncé was wrapping up the album , several of its songs had leaked online . In efforts to prevent more tracks in the album from being spread illegally , as well as being a victim of <unk> , Columbia Records , with high commercial expectations from the album , pulled the release of Dangerously in Love to June 24 , 2003 , two weeks ahead of the planned July 8 release . 
 <unk> who pre @-@ ordered the album online received links where they could download a song called " I Can 't Take No More " ; the <unk> lasted until the album 's release . On June 14 , 2003 , Beyoncé premiered songs from the album during her first solo concert and the pay @-@ per @-@ view TV special , " Ford Presents Beyoncé , Friends & Family , Live From Ford 's 100th <unk> Celebration in <unk> , Michigan " . By the night of the album 's release , Beyoncé 's concert was broadcast in more than twenty theaters across the United States . Kelly Rowland , Michelle Williams , <unk> , <unk> Knowles and girl group <unk> also performed in the show . Beyoncé also promoted the album by performing in television shows such as the Saturday Night Live , Late Show with David Letterman , The Today Show , The Early Show , and The View . 
 By April 2003 , Beyoncé 's management was choosing the album 's lead single between two songs . <unk> to clubs , the song that would receive positive reception would be considered the lead single . Finally , " Crazy in Love " was released as the lead single off the album . With commercial success that included crossover music markets , the single spent eight consecutive weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 . " Baby Boy " followed , and received greater success than " Crazy in Love " . With its dominance on radio <unk> , the single surpassed " Crazy in Love " ' s chart performance , remaining on the top spot for nine consecutive weeks . " Me , Myself and I " was released as the third single and " Naughty Girl " as fourth and last ; although the last two releases only reached the top five on the Hot 100 , they all attained immediate commercial success and helped the album earn multi @-@ platinum certifications . 
 " Crazy in Love " was released as the lead single in mid @-@ 2003 . It was lauded by critics who described it as " <unk> catchy " . The single reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 , the official US singles chart , based on heavy rotation alone . The same week the song reached number one , Dangerously in Love debuted on the Billboard 200 at number one as well . The substantial airplay and later retail sales of " Crazy in Love " facilitated it to dominate the chart , subsequently spending eight straight weeks atop the Hot 100 , making it Beyoncé 's first number @-@ one single in her solo career . According to Nielsen SoundScan , " Crazy in Love " was the most downloaded song in the United States for four consecutive weeks in July 2003 . It also became a success internationally reaching the top of the charts in Ireland and the United Kingdom . " Baby Boy " was released as the second single in August 2003 . It was well received by critics , who declared it a " high @-@ profile collaboration " that " bridges the gap between the genres of R & B and <unk> . " It ultimately reached the top of the Hot 100 . It reached the chart 's top spot eight weeks after its debut , and stayed there for nine consecutive weeks . It peaked in the top two in the United Kingdom . 
 " Me , Myself and I " was released as the album 's third single in October 2003 . It received generally positive response , being considered a typical sounding R & B ballad with a familiar theme , in which Beyoncé sings with passion . It reached the top ten in Canada and the United States . " Naughty Girl " was the fourth single from the album , released in March 2004 . The song was lauded by critics , who cited its sensual vibe and writing : " Beyoncé borrowed a portion of <unk> Summer 's <unk> classic " Love to Love You Baby " to create this celebration of sensual <unk> . " <unk> , it became a top ten hit in the United States , Australia , Canada and New Zealand . 
 Dangerously in Love and its singles earned Beyoncé numerous awards and nominations . In 2003 , Beyoncé was recognized as New Female Artist and New R & B Artist , among the four awards she won during the Billboard Music Awards . At the 2013 American Music Awards , the album was nominated in the category for Favorite Soul / R & B Album . It also received a nomination in the category for Best Album at the 2003 <unk> Awards . At the 46th Annual Grammy Awards , Beyoncé won Best Contemporary R & B Album along with four other awards for the album 's songs . With that feat , she tied with Alicia Keys , <unk> Jones , and <unk> Hill for most <unk> won by a female artist in one night . At the 2004 <unk> Awards , the album was nominated in the category for Best International Album but lost to Justin Timberlake 's <unk> . However , the singer herself won in the category for Best International Female Solo Artist . Dangerously in Love was also nominated in the category for Best Album at the 2004 MTV Europe Music Awards . 
 The 1,000th issue of Entertainment Weekly , which celebrated " the new classics " in the entertainment industry in the period from 1983 to 2008 , ranked Dangerously in Love nineteenth in the Top 100 Best Albums of the past 25 years . The album also ranked at number 183 on the list " 200 <unk> Albums That <unk> Rock and Roll " according to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . 
 Dangerously in Love debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart , with sales of 317 @,@ 000 copies according to Nielsen SoundScan . In its second week the album <unk> to number two with 183 @,@ 000 sold , behind <unk> 's Chapter II . Although the album 's first @-@ week sales failed to match that of Survivor , which sold <unk> @,@ 000 units in its debut in 2001 , Beyoncé earned the highest among Destiny 's Child members ' solo albums by best weeks : Rowland sold 77 @,@ 000 copies for <unk> Deep in its strongest week while Williams earned 17 @,@ 000 copies for Heart to Yours in its top week . The album has been certified four @-@ time platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) . Dangerously in Love remains as Beyoncé 's best @-@ selling album to date , with cumulative sales of 5 million copies in the United States as of June 2016 . 
 <unk> , Dangerously in Love had similar commercial reception . On July 12 , 2003 , Beyoncé became the first female artist ( and the fifth artist ever ) to top both the singles — with " Crazy in Love " — and albums chart simultaneously in the United States and the United Kingdom , following The Beatles , Simon & <unk> , Rod Stewart , and Men at Work . As of June 2011 , the album had sold over 1 @,@ 150 @,@ 000 copies in the United Kingdom , and the British Phonographic Industry has since certified the album four @-@ times platinum for sales of more than 1 @.@ 2 million units . Dangerously in Love was the 15th @-@ best selling album of 2003 in the United Kingdom . It is her second best @-@ selling album in the UK . In Australia , it reached number two ; the album was certified triple platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association for sales of 210 @,@ 000 copies . In 2003 , Dangerously in Love was the 51st best @-@ selling album in Australia , and the <unk> the following year . As of 2015 , the album has sold more than 10 million copies worldwide . 
 With the release of Dangerously in Love and the combined commercial success of its singles , Beyoncé had established herself a viable solo artist . Rebecca <unk> of the New York Daily News wrote that the success of Dangerously in Love brought Beyoncé into a " <unk> solo star " who " <unk> from a <unk> group " , referring to Destiny 's Child . The album has also facilitated her to become one of the <unk> artists in the industry . She appeared on the cover of numerous magazines , <unk> TV for promotions , and has signed lucrative commercial deals . Beyoncé signed to <unk> , a conglomerate <unk> manufacturer , in 2003 , and appeared on several TV commercials for its products . 
 The creative output of the sessions for Dangerously in Love left several tracks ready for another album pressing . In late 2003 , Beyoncé planned to release a follow @-@ up album that would comprise left @-@ over songs from Dangerously in Love . The move was prompted when a P. <unk> @-@ collaboration called " <unk> " , a left @-@ over track from the album , was sent to radio stations and had received favorable response . 
 Meanwhile , the success of the album <unk> the public to <unk> that it signals Destiny 's Child to finally part ways , as had pop singer Justin Timberlake " could not go back to ' N <unk> after tasting solo success " . However , Beyoncé said that their side projects were only " a brief diversion in the <unk> that has become Destiny 's Child " . As time did not permit , Beyoncé 's musical aspirations were put on hiatus for her to concentrate on her Super Bowl performance , wherein she was slated to sing the U.S. national anthem , and the recording of Destiny 's Child 's fourth album , Destiny Fulfilled ; the group finally disbanded in 2005 . 
 After the group 's formal disbandment , Beyoncé recorded and released her second album , B 'Day , on September 4 , 2006 . The album gave Beyoncé her second number one in the United States , and its debut week sales exceeded that of Dangerously in Love , the former having sold <unk> @,@ 000 units . Despite the album 's first two singles ' average commercial performance — neither of which reached the peak of the Billboard Hot 100 — its " handsome debut " was noted by Keith <unk> of Billboard as having generated " by goodwill earned from the performance of [ Beyoncé 's ] smash first album Dangerously in Love .

 <unk> is a fungal genus in the family <unk> . The genus is monotypic , containing the single species <unk> <unk> . It is an earthstar , so named because the spore @-@ bearing <unk> 's outer wall splits open into the shape of a star . The inedible fungus has a cosmopolitan distribution , and has been found in Africa , Asia , North and South America , and Europe , where it grows in <unk> @-@ rich forests or in woodlands , especially on well @-@ drained and sandy soils . A somewhat rare fungus , it appears on the Red <unk> of 12 European countries , and in 2004 it was one of 33 species proposed for protection under the Bern Convention by the European Council for Conservation of Fungi . 
 The fruit body , initially shaped like a puffball , is <unk> within an outer covering that splits open from the top to form rays . These rays curve down to expose an inner <unk> spore case , which contains the fertile spore @-@ bearing tissue , the gleba . The fungus is unique among the earthstars in having a spore case that is supported by multiple stalks , and is <unk> by several small holes <unk> of its common names salt @-@ <unk> earthstar and <unk> . It is the largest of the earthstar fungi , and reaches diameters of up to 12 cm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) . Its spherical spores have elongated warts that create a ridge @-@ like pattern on their surface . The spores are dispersed when falling water hits the outer wall of the spore sac , creating <unk> of air that force the spores through the holes . 
 In North America the fungus began to be reported in the late 19th century , first from Colorado by Charles Horton Peck , and later from Florida , collected by <unk> Underwood in 1891 ; both findings were reported by Andrew Price Morgan in April 1892 . In 1897 , <unk> <unk> Cook also reported having collected it the year before from " <unk> Beach " . Curtis Gates Lloyd described <unk> <unk> from a South African specimen in 1919 , but in 1942 , William Henry Long examined that specimen and concluded that it was a weathered spore sac of M. <unk> that had become detached from the outer star @-@ shaped exoperidium . This conclusion was confirmed in a later study of the material . 
 <unk> had been classified in the <unk> family until 1973 , when British mycologist Donald <unk> placed it in the <unk> based on the presence of <unk> ( stout columns that extend from the peridium to the central core of the fruit body ) in the gleba , and the absence of a true hymenium . In his 1989 <unk> , <unk> <unk> returned it to the <unk> . Molecular analysis of DNA sequences has confirmed the traditional belief that <unk> and Geastrum are closely related . 
 <unk> Jan <unk> proposed a variety <unk> in 1958 , which has been sunk back into <unk> with the species . M. <unk> is the sole species in <unk> , making the genus monotypic . Because the original type material has been lost , in 1989 <unk> suggested that Dickson 's illustration in his 1776 publication ( <unk> . III : <unk> & b ) be used as the <unk> . 
 <unk> <unk> is a distinctive species easily characterized by its size — being the largest earthstar fungus — as well as the multiple openings on its spore <unk> and stalk supporting the <unk> . Historically , it was thought that the holes might have been a result of insects . This was discussed and rejected by Thomas <unk> Woodward in 1797 : 
 It has been doubted whether these mouths might not be accidental , and formed by insects after the expansion of the plant . But this ( not to mention their <unk> , and that each is <unk> by its border of <unk> ) is clearly <unk> , from the marks of the projections formed by the mouths being seen on the expanded rays , when <unk> opened ... I have likewise found an abortive plant , in which the seed did not <unk> ; but which had numerous projecting papillae on the head , where the mouths should have been formed . 
 <unk> is saprobic , deriving nutrients from decomposing organic matter . Fruit bodies grow grouped in well @-@ drained or sandy soil , often in the partial shade of trees . The species occurs in deciduous forests and mixed forests , gardens , along <unk> and grassy road banks , and grazed grasslands . In the Northern Hemisphere , it tends to grow on well @-@ drained south @-@ facing slopes , while it prefers a similar habitat on north @-@ facing slopes in Australia . In Europe , its major habitat is riparian mixed forests dominated by <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> along the great rivers . In Hawaii , it has been collected at elevations above 2 @,@ 000 m ( 6 @,@ 600 ft ) where it appears to favor the <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) forest . 
 The species is widespread , being known in its natural habitat from all five continents , but is not found in abundance . <unk> <unk> is rare in Europe , where it appears on the Regional Red <unk> of 12 countries , and is one of 33 candidate species for listing in <unk> I of the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural <unk> ( the " Bern Convention " ) . Although originally described from England , it was considered extinct in mainland Britain until it was found again in Suffolk in 2006 near Ipswich , one of its original localities — it had been last reported in the country in 1880 . The fungus is considered extinct in Switzerland . Its most northerly location is southern Sweden , although it is generally rare in northern Europe . It is similarly widespread but rarely encountered in North America , although there may be isolated localities , like New Mexico , where it is more abundant . In Australia , where its range is limited to the central New South Wales coast , it may have been introduced from exotic plant material . 
 The <unk> <unk> and the Pacific white @-@ sided <unk> are considered <unk> related species . Some researchers have suggested they are the same species , but morphological and life @-@ history evidence shows otherwise . The two sister species diverged at around 1 @.@ 9 – 3 @.@ 0 million years ago . Recent analysis of the mitochondrial <unk> b gene indicates that the genus <unk> , as traditionally conceived , is not a natural ( monophyletic ) group . Another study finds that the <unk> and the Pacific white @-@ sided <unk> form the sister group to the ( expanded ) genus <unk> . If this placement is accurate , a new genus name will need to be coined to accommodate these two species . 
 The <unk> <unk> is small to medium in length compared with other species in the family . There is significant variation in size among the different population areas . The largest <unk> <unk> have been encountered off the coast of Peru , where they are up to 210 cm ( 6 feet ) in length and 100 kg ( 210 pounds ) in mass . The size for <unk> <unk> in New Zealand have been recorded to be a length range of 167 – 178 cm and a weight range of 69 – 78 kg for females and a length range of 165 – 175 cm and a weigh range of 70 – 85 kg for males . 
 Females with calves tend to gather in nursery groups in shallow water . Nursery groups likely provide mothers and calves more time to rest , which is important for both . While the <unk> of nursery groups vary by month , resting is the predominant behaviour during most months . The formation of nursery groups in shallow waters also allows members to hunt prey species that inhabit in these waters . Both adults and calves have been observed to chase and catch fish , and the adults may be teaching the calves how to hunt . In contrast to shallower waters , hunting in deep water at night may be too dangerous for calves . <unk> are particularly vulnerable to predators like killer <unk> and use of shallow water by nursery groups may be a way to avoid predation . Nursery groups tend to avoid mating groups . Adult males in these groups will aggressively herd and chase females . They can separate calves from their mothers and harass them , as well . <unk> may also become even more vulnerable to predators as they become exhausted and <unk> . Mother <unk> may look after calves that are not their own . 
 The <unk> <unk> is listed on <unk> II of the Convention on the Conservation of <unk> Species of Wild Animals ( <unk> ) as it has an <unk> conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co @-@ operation organised by tailored agreements . 
 The effect of <unk> farming on <unk> <unk> has been studied in Admiralty Bay , New Zealand . <unk> <unk> are commonly seen in this area , which is also where the greatest density of farming activity is proposed . Apparently , <unk> rarely enter existing farms , and when they do , they usually swim quickly up the lanes and between rows of lines and floats . 
 While <unk> <unk> tourism is a larger industry in New Zealand than it is in Argentina , the effects of tourism on the <unk> seem to be lower in the former than the latter . New Zealand tours are operated under permits , and are limited in number and have conditions and guidelines related to approach procedures and swim operations . By contrast , no direct regulation of <unk> watching is done in Argentina . As such , <unk> activities are often disturbed by touring vessels .

 In 2012 <unk> opened the Mandarin Chinese Language <unk> <unk> School Chinese language @-@ <unk> magnet school in <unk> , in the Gordon Elementary School building . It is <unk> 's first Chinese immersion school . In the future the school will move to the St. George Place area of Houston . 
 <unk> is building a new campus for <unk> Elementary School , and this campus , designed by <unk> Architects , will have a capacity of 750 students . The groundbreaking ceremony was held on November 10 , 2014 . 
 Maud W. Gordon Elementary School in <unk> does not have a <unk> boundary ; before 2012 it drew excess students from apartments west of <unk> , in Houston , to relieve other schools in Houston west of <unk> such as <unk> , Cunningham , <unk> , and Milne . From its opening to 1953 to 1983 Gordon served as a neighborhood school . After its closure Gordon temporarily housed the Post Oak School and later served as administrative offices . It re @-@ opened as a relief school in 1988 for <unk> and Cunningham schools . It was scheduled to re @-@ open in September of that year . 
 On April 29 , 1992 , during an attendance boundary hearing committee for Southwest Houston , residents of a small portion of <unk> <unk> to Cunningham Elementary School , a school in Houston that was one block away from the city limits of <unk> , advocated for a <unk> to <unk> Elementary School , a facility in the City of <unk> that was about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) away from that section . <unk> was about 50 % White and had a middle class student body while Cunningham was 95 % Hispanic .

 Alien <unk> is a platformer video game for Microsoft Windows , Macintosh , Xbox 360 ( through Xbox Live Arcade ) , and PlayStation 3 ( through PlayStation Network ) . It was developed by <unk> Software Productions and published by <unk> Media . Players control an extraterrestrial spider who has crash @-@ landed on Earth , as he seeks to repair his spacecraft and rescue a fellow extraterrestrial spider . 
 <unk> on 8 November 2011 , Alien <unk> was published on 20 March 2013 for the Xbox 360 , Microsoft Windows , and Macintosh , and on 8 May 2013 for the PlayStation 3 . It received mixed to negative reviews upon release ; critics praised the game 's aesthetics but found the gameplay frustrating due to <unk> controls and an <unk> level of <unk> that hampered progression through the game . 
 Alien <unk> has a minimal plot . The story follows the <unk> , a spider from the planet <unk> , who has crash @-@ landed on Earth during an attempt to rescue a lady spider , <unk> . <unk> must locate <unk> and collect pieces of his spacecraft in order to return to <unk> . 
 On 8 November 2011 , the game was announced in a press release , with <unk> Software Productions as the developer and <unk> Media as the publisher . The press release indicated that the game would be released in the second quarter of 2012 . 
 Alien <unk> was advertised as a PlayStation Vita game early in its development history , with Sony using gameplay footage of the game on the Vita at a presentation at Gamescom 2011 . The game was never released on that platform , however . In an interview , <unk> Software CEO Daniel <unk> claimed that the game was developed for all major platforms , and after bringing <unk> Media on board as a publisher , the latter chose which platforms to release the game on , and when . The project manager at <unk> Media for Alien <unk> , Andrew <unk> , noted that the developer attempted to secure a publisher by pitching the game on a large number of platforms . In a separate interview with Daniel <unk> , conducted in October 2012 , <unk> Software 's CEO called the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 the game 's lead platforms , stating that the game was " designed to be played with a <unk> " . 
 The game was delayed several times . In August 2012 , the website <unk> Fans reported that the game would be delayed into the fall of that year . By October , a preview on the gaming website <unk> listed the release date as 31 December 2012 . The game was released on the Xbox 360 , Microsoft Windows , and Macintosh on 20 March 2013 , and was released on the PlayStation 3 on 8 May 2013 . 
 Alien <unk> received mixed to negative reviews upon release . At Metacritic , a video game review aggregator , the Xbox 360 version of the game received an average score of 55 out of 100 , based on 19 reviews . 
 The game 's visuals were praised by reviewers . GamesRadar 's Lorenzo <unk> opined that " <unk> characters , beautiful visuals , and upbeat music stand out as the high points of Alien <unk> " . A large number of reviewers called the game and its characters " cute " . While a few of the reviewers praised the game 's music , Jeremy <unk> of Hardcore Gamer found that it lacked staying power . He noted , however , that the music could be muted without also <unk> the sound effects , allowing people to play their own music . 
 Critics near universally took issue with the game 's controls . Critics found that the <unk> that they shot did not go where they wanted them to go , and multiple reviewers described navigation as " trial and error " . Reviewers also found that they could not always jump when they wanted to , and one reviewer found that power @-@ ups failed to activate when she wanted them to . Reviewers also complained that it was extremely difficult to get enough stars to progress from one stage to the next , forcing players to replay the same levels over and over again . Because points are <unk> each time <unk> dies , the problems with the control scheme <unk> how difficult it is to get enough stars to progress . 
 Opinions on the game 's mid @-@ level <unk> system were mixed . Matt Cullen of Canadian Online Gaming noted that the checkpoints meant that players were not sent too far back into the level after each death , saving time . Official Xbox Magazine 's Taylor <unk> , however , noted that the checkpoints save players ' point progress , meaning that players would have to start the level over if their performance wasn 't good enough before they reached the <unk> . 
 The preferred habitat is open woodland and transitional zones . It has adapted well to urban environments and is a common city bird in Sydney , Canberra and Perth . An omnivorous and opportunistic <unk> , it eats a wide variety of plant and animal material , as well as food waste from urban areas . In eastern Australia its range is strongly correlated with the presence of sheep , and it has been blamed for killing lambs . However , this is very rare , and the <unk> most often <unk> for <unk> and stillborn animals as well as newborn lamb <unk> . The Australian <unk> is territorial , with pairs generally bonding for life . Breeding takes place between July and September , with almost no variation across its range . The nest is a bowl @-@ shaped structure of sticks sited high in a tree , or occasionally in a man @-@ made structure such as a <unk> or other building . 
 C. c. <unk> , the nominate or eastern subspecies , is found across most of eastern Australia . Its range is also highly correlated with the presence of sheep . This is thought to be because of the frequency of dead animals , which can be an important source of food . <unk> Ian Rowley held that the eastern subspecies was expanding eastwards before European colonisation , and that this suggested it was of younger origin than the western subspecies , which appears static . The advent of agriculture facilitated further spread . 
 C. c. <unk> , the western subspecies , occurs from the head of the Great Australian Bight in South Australia <unk> into Western Australia where its northern limits are Shark Bay and the <unk> @-@ eucalypt boundary line . It is less specialised in its habitat , as it does not share its distribution with the little <unk> , and does not appear to <unk> with the range of sheep . The western subspecies has a slightly lower @-@ pitched call than that of the eastern subspecies , with similarities to calls of the little <unk> . Of smaller size overall , it has a more slender bill and shorter <unk> . There is otherwise no difference in plumage . Intermediate birds are found in the <unk> Peninsula , <unk> Ranges and vicinity of Lake <unk> in South Australia . 
 Juveniles resemble adults , but lack throat <unk> , and sometimes have a pink <unk> <unk> . The bill is shorter and shallower ; its base can be pinkish and the tip can be light grey . The plumage is more <unk> and softer in appearance , lacks the glossy highlights and often having a brown tinge . The bare skin on the throat is pink in bird that have recently left the nest . Eye colour varies with age , gradually <unk> from juvenile to adult . <unk> up to four months old have blue @-@ grey irises , juveniles aged from four to fifteen months have dark brown irises , and immature birds have <unk> irises with an inner blue rim around each pupil until age two years and ten months . <unk> birds older than one year develop <unk> , while some pink remains in the <unk> until the bird is two or three years of age . 
 The volume , pitch , tempo and order of notes can be changed depending on the message the Australian <unk> intends to convey . There are a variety of contact calls : a pair often makes a low <unk> sound when <unk> each other while roosting , and members of a flock carry on with a quiet chattering while at rest . Birds make a call and answer sequence if temporarily out of sight of one another while foraging . Birds in flocks make a single high @-@ pitched <unk> while flying over another territory as a transit call to signify they are just passing through . An Australian <unk> will give a longer <unk> with a downward <unk> to signify its return to the nest to its mate . 
 <unk> in distinguishing Australian <unk> has hampered understanding of seasonal movements . The Australian <unk> is thought to be largely sedentary , with most movement of over 16 km ( 9 @.@ 9 mi ) due to flocks of non @-@ breeding <unk> birds . <unk> birds leave their parents and join flocks when they are four or five months old . Smaller flocks of 8 – 30 birds stay within an area of around 260 square kilometres , while larger flocks of up to 300 birds may travel hundreds of kilometres seeking food . 
 A single breeding pair and their brood can occupy a territory of up to around 120 hectares ( 300 acres ) and remains there year @-@ round , though groups of <unk> may enter this area to forage . Australian <unk> will defend their territory by chasing , dive @-@ bombing and occasionally striking the backs of birds of prey , foxes or even people . They generally mate for life , though occasionally one male has been found to be mated with two females in adjacent territories . If the female dies , the male Australian <unk> maintains the territory and finds another mate , while if the male bird is lost , the female abandons the territory . No courtship behaviour has been observed , and species that mate for life often lack elaborate courting displays . Once they begin breeding at three years of age , they live another four to five years on average . During this time they produce two surviving young each year on average . The longest @-@ lived Australian <unk> recorded is an adult ( of at least 3 years of age ) that was banded and recaptured alive 12 years and 5 months later . 
 Australian <unk> generally walk when moving around on the ground , though do hop when <unk> . They <unk> themselves frequently , particularly when roosting in the middle of the day . They also engage in <unk> , where birds will <unk> each other 's head and neck . This takes place particularly in autumn , winter and spring , and is important in pair bonding . Either member may initiate it , generally by landing near the other bird , <unk> next to its mate , then <unk> its head forward and presenting its nape . 
 Australian <unk> begin breeding once they are three years old . Breeding season is from July to September , with no substantial difference in timing across its range around the country despite it inhabiting a range of diverse climates and habitats across 19 degrees of latitude . Rowley has pointed out this is unusual for a bird species with a wide range and has postulated that breeding is initiated by day length . Rarely , breeding can take place in May , June or October . Australian <unk> generally nest in tall trees , never near to the ground as some species do . The nest also functions as a lookout post and so tall or <unk> trees are selected . The <unk> occasionally nest on buildings , telegraph poles , or tall <unk> which allow the species to occupy areas lacking in tall trees . <unk> may have assisted the spread of the species in North Queensland and the Northern Territory . The highest recorded <unk> nest in Australia was found atop the <unk> Tower in Sydney . 
 Nests are generally large and untidy , consisting of a bowl or platform of sticks lined with grasses , <unk> , and feathers that can be up to 5 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick . As they are relatively heavy , they are built on larger forks in trees rather than out in the canopy . Building the nest is often time @-@ consuming initially as the birds try ( and often fail ) to wedge sticks , which are 30 – 60 cm ( 12 – 24 in ) long and 0 @.@ 6 – 1 @.@ 2 cm ( 1 ⁄ 4 – 1 ⁄ 2 in ) thick , into the tree fork to make a platform . <unk> sticks and rootlets are used to make the bowl before the bowl is lined with feathers . Both birds build the nest , with the female taking over the lining of the nest while the male brings her material . New nests are built each year generally , as the re @-@ use of old ones might spread disease or parasites — nests become <unk> with <unk> as the nestlings grow and the parents cannot keep up with its removal . Furthermore , old nests often <unk> within twelve months due to their exposed locations . The female develops a brood patch — a patch of bare skin on the bird 's underparts that <unk> and becomes much more extensive from around three weeks before the first egg is laid . The skin itself is <unk> and wrinkled , and does not get re @-@ feathered until December after the breeding season has finished . 
 Their <unk> locations makes monitoring of Australian <unk> nests difficult . A clutch can comprise up to six eggs , though usually four or five are laid , with five being the <unk> number . Measuring 45 by 30 mm ( 1 3 ⁄ 4 by 1 1 ⁄ 4 in ) , eggs are pale green or bluish @-@ green and <unk> with darker olive , brown and blackish markings . <unk> are quite variable , and thus which Australian <unk> laid them cannot be reliably identified . Incubation of the eggs is done solely by the female over roughly 20 days . Incubation is intermittent initially , becoming constant by the time the third or fourth egg is laid . Only one brood is raised per year , though a second clutch may be laid if the first clutch is lost early in the season . Late clutches have poor survival rates , possibly due to chicks getting <unk> on hot days as the year progresses or being eaten by wedge @-@ tailed eagles . The chicks are <unk> and <unk> ; that is , they are born helpless , naked and blind , and remain in the nest for an extended period . They have pink skin until 5 days of age , when feathers under the skin turn it grey . They lose their egg tooth at the same time . Their eyes begin opening at 5 to 6 days of age and are fully open by 11 to 12 days , by which time their feathers begin emerging . At 14 days , their primary feathers begin emerging , and they are fully feathered by 35 – 36 days old . They leave the nest at 40 – 45 days of age , and stay with the parents for three to four months after that . They follow their parents and beg for food for the first month outside the nest but are feeding themselves by the third month . Young birds are often attacked when they enter neighbouring territories , and <unk> ensue as their parents try to defend them and herd them back . 
 In Australian Aboriginal mythology , Crow is a <unk> , culture hero and ancestral being . In the <unk> nation in central Victoria he was known as <unk> ( also <unk> or <unk> ) and was regarded as one of two <unk> ancestors , the other being the more <unk> <unk> <unk> . Legends relating to Crow have been observed in various Aboriginal language groups and cultures across Australia . 
 The Clifton <unk> Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Avon <unk> and the River Avon , linking Clifton in Bristol to Leigh Woods in North Somerset . Since opening in 1864 , it has been a toll bridge . The income from the tolls continues to provide funds for its maintenance . The bridge is built to a design by William Henry <unk> and John <unk> , based on an earlier design by <unk> Kingdom <unk> , and contributed to by Sarah <unk> . It is a grade I listed building and forms part of the <unk> road . 
 The idea of building a bridge across the Avon <unk> originated in 1753 . Original plans were for a stone bridge and later <unk> were for a wrought iron structure . In 1831 , an attempt to build <unk> 's design was halted by the Bristol riots , and the revised version of his designs was built after his death and completed in 1864 . Although similar in size , the bridge towers are not identical in design , the Clifton tower having side cut @-@ outs , the Leigh tower more pointed arches atop a 110 @-@ foot ( 34 m ) red sandstone @-@ clad <unk> . <unk> @-@ mounted " <unk> " at the top of each tower allow movement of the three independent wrought iron chains on each side when loads pass over the bridge . The bridge deck is suspended by 162 vertical wrought @-@ iron rods in 81 matching pairs . 
 The Clifton Bridge Company initially managed the bridge under licence from a charitable trust . The trust subsequently purchased the company shares , completing this in 1949 and took over the running of the bridge using the income from tolls to pay for maintenance . The bridge is a distinctive landmark , used as a symbol of Bristol on postcards , promotional materials , and <unk> web sites . It was also used as a backdrop to several films and television advertising and programmes . It has also been the venue for significant cultural events such as the first modern <unk> jump in 1979 , the last ever Concorde flight in 2003 and a handover of the Olympic <unk> relay in 2012 . 
 In 1753 <unk> merchant William <unk> had left a bequest in his will of £ 1 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to £ 140 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) , invested with instructions that when the interest had accumulated to £ 10 @,@ 000 ( £ 1 @,@ 370 @,@ 000 ) , it should be used for the purpose of building a stone bridge between Clifton Down ( which was in Gloucestershire , outside the City of Bristol , until the 1830s ) and Leigh Woods in Somerset . Although there was little development in the area before the late 18th century , as Bristol became more prosperous , Clifton became fashionable and more wealthy merchants moved to the area . In 1793 William Bridges published plans for a stone arch with abutments containing factories , which would pay for the upkeep of the bridge . The French Revolutionary Wars broke out soon after the design was published , affecting trade and commerce , so the plans were <unk> . Sarah <unk> patented designs for a suspension bridge across the <unk> which she later gave to <unk> . 
 A ceremony to mark the start of the construction works was held on 21 June 1831 . A few days later work was halted by the Bristol riots , which took place after the House of Lords rejected the second Reform Bill , which aimed to eliminate some of the rotten <unk> and give parliamentary seats to Britain 's fast growing industrial towns such as Bristol . Five hundred to six hundred young men were involved in the riots and <unk> was sworn in as a special constable . The riots severely <unk> commercial confidence in Bristol ; subscriptions to the bridge company ceased , and along with it , further construction of the bridge . 
 <unk> died in 1859 , without seeing the completion of the bridge . His colleagues in the Institution of Civil Engineers felt that completion of the Bridge would be a fitting memorial , and started to raise new funds . In 1860 , <unk> 's Hungerford suspension bridge over the Thames in London was demolished to make way for a new railway bridge to Charing Cross railway station . Its chains were purchased for use at Clifton . 
 A revised design was made by William Henry <unk> and Sir John <unk> , with a wider , higher and <unk> deck than <unk> intended , with triple chains instead of double . 
 On 8 December 1864 , the bridge was lit by magnesium flares for its ceremonial opening parade , but they were blown out by the wind . The custom of lighting the bridge has continued with more recent events , although later thousands of electric light bulbs were attached to the bridge instead of flares . 
 In 1860 the Clifton Bridge Company was set up to oversee the final stages of completion and manage the operation of the bridge . They paid £ 50 each year to the trustees who gradually purchased the shares in the company . The revenues from tolls were minimal initially as there was not much traffic ; however , this increased after 1920 with greater car ownership . In 1949 the trustees purchased all the outstanding shares and <unk> . The bridge is managed by a charitable trust , originally formed by the Society of <unk> <unk> following <unk> 's bequest . The trust was authorised to manage the bridge and collect tolls by Acts of Parliament in 1952 , 1980 and 1986 . A toll of £ 0 @.@ 50 has been <unk> on vehicles since 2007 , but the £ 0 @.@ 05 toll that the Act allows for <unk> or pedestrians is not collected . Human toll collectors were replaced by automated machines in 1975 . The tolls are used to pay for the upkeep of the bridge , including the strengthening of the chain anchor points , which was done in 1925 and 1939 , and regular painting and maintenance , which is carried out from a motorised <unk> <unk> beneath the deck . By 2008 over 4 million vehicles crossed the bridge each year . In February 2012 , the bridge trustees applied to the Department for Transport to increase the toll to £ 1 , subsequently implemented on 24 April 2014 . 
 On 1 April 1979 , the first modern <unk> jumps were made from the bridge by members of the University of Oxford Dangerous Sports Club . In 2003 and 2004 , the weight of crowds travelling to and from the Ashton Court Festival and Bristol International <unk> <unk> put such great strain on the bridge that it was decided to close the bridge to all motor traffic and pedestrians during the events . The closure of the bridge for major annual events has continued each year since then . 
 On 26 November 2003 , the last ever Concorde flight ( Concorde 216 ) flew over the bridge before landing at <unk> Aerodrome . In April 2006 , the bridge was the <unk> of the <unk> 200 weekend , celebrating the 200th anniversary of the birth of <unk> Kingdom <unk> . At the climax of the celebration a <unk> display was launched from the bridge . The celebrations also saw the activation of an LED @-@ based lighting array to illuminate the bridge . 
 On 4 April 2009 , the bridge was shut for one night to allow a crack in one of the support <unk> to be repaired . On 23 May 2012 , the London 2012 Olympic <unk> relay crossed over the bridge , where two of the <unk> came together in a " kiss " to exchange the flame in the middle of <unk> 's iconic landmark . The bridge carries four million vehicles per year , along part of the <unk> road . The bridge is a grade I listed building . 
 In November 2011 it was announced that a new visitor centre , costing nearly £ 2 million , was to be built at the Leigh Woods end of the bridge to replace the temporary building currently being used . The new facilities were scheduled to be completed before the 150th anniversary of the opening , which was celebrated on 8 December 2014 . In December 2012 it was announced that the bridge had received £ 595 @,@ 000 of funding from the Heritage <unk> Fund to improve the visitor centre . 
 Although similar in size , the bridge towers are not identical in design , the Clifton tower having side cut @-@ outs , the Leigh tower more pointed arches . <unk> 's original plan proposed they be topped with then @-@ fashionable <unk> , but the ornaments were never constructed . 
 The 85 @-@ foot @-@ tall ( 26 m ) Leigh Woods tower stands atop a 110 @-@ foot ( 34 m ) red sandstone @-@ clad <unk> . In 2002 it was discovered that this was not a solid structure but contained 12 vaulted chambers up to 35 feet ( 11 m ) high , linked by shafts and tunnels . 
 <unk> @-@ mounted " <unk> " at the top of each tower allow movement of the chains when loads pass over the bridge . Though their total travel is <unk> , their ability to absorb forces created by chain <unk> prevents damage to both tower and chain . 
 The bridge has three independent wrought iron chains per side , from which the bridge deck is suspended by eighty @-@ one matching vertical wrought @-@ iron rods ranging from 65 feet ( 20 m ) at the ends to 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) in the centre . <unk> of numerous parallel rows of <unk> connected by bolts , the chains are anchored in tunnels in the rocks 60 feet ( 18 m ) below ground level at the sides of the <unk> . The deck was originally laid with wooden <unk> , later covered with asphalt , which was renewed in 2009 . The weight of the bridge , including chains , rods , <unk> and deck is approximately 1 @,@ 500 tons . 
 Two men were killed during the construction of the bridge . In 1885 , a 22 @-@ year @-@ old woman named Sarah Ann <unk> survived a suicide attempt off the bridge when her <unk> skirts acted as a parachute ; she subsequently lived into her eighties . 
 The Clifton <unk> Bridge is well known as a suicide bridge and is fitted with plaques that advertise the telephone number of The <unk> . Between 1974 and 1993 , 127 people fell to their deaths from the bridge . In 1998 barriers were installed on the bridge to prevent people jumping . In the four years after installation this reduced the suicide rate from eight deaths per year to four . <unk> Powell , the wife of UK rhythm and blues singer <unk> Fame , formerly the <unk> of <unk> , committed suicide from the bridge on 13 August 1993 . 
 In 1957 a <unk> @-@ based RAF Vampire jet from <unk> Squadron <unk> by Flying officer John Greenwood flew under the deck while performing a victory roll before crashing in Leigh Woods , killing the pilot . The accident caused a <unk> that led to the temporary closure of the nearby Bristol to <unk> railway line . A police helicopter flew under the bridge during a search in 1997 . 
 On 12 February 2014 the bridge was closed to traffic due to wind for the first time in living memory . 
 The social history of viruses describes the influence of viruses and viral infections on human history . <unk> caused by viruses began when human behaviour changed during the Neolithic period , around 12 @,@ 000 years ago , when humans developed more densely populated agricultural communities . This allowed viruses to spread rapidly and subsequently to become endemic . <unk> of plants and livestock also increased , and as humans became dependent on agriculture and farming , diseases such as <unk> of potatoes and <unk> of cattle had devastating consequences . 
 <unk> and <unk> viruses are among the oldest that infect humans . Having evolved from viruses that infected other animals , they first appeared in humans in Europe and North Africa thousands of years ago . The viruses were later carried to the New World by Europeans during the time of the Spanish <unk> , but the indigenous people had no natural resistance to the viruses and millions of them died during <unk> . <unk> <unk> have been recorded since 1580 , and they have occurred with increasing frequency in subsequent centuries . The pandemic of 1918 – 19 , in which 40 – 50 million died in less than a year , was one of the most devastating in history . 
 Louis <unk> and Edward <unk> were the first to develop <unk> to protect against viral infections . The nature of viruses remained unknown until the invention of the electron microscope in the 1930s , when the science of <unk> gained momentum . In the 20th century many diseases both old and new were found to be caused by viruses . There were <unk> of <unk> that were only controlled following the development of a vaccine in the 1950s . HIV is one of the most pathogenic new viruses to have emerged in centuries . Although scientific interest in them arose because of the diseases they cause , most viruses are beneficial . They drive evolution by transferring genes across species , play important roles in ecosystems and are essential to life . 
 Over the past 50 @,@ 000 – 100 @,@ 000 years , as modern humans increased in numbers and dispersed throughout the world , new infectious diseases emerged , including those caused by viruses . Earlier , humans lived in small , isolated communities , and most epidemic diseases did not exist . <unk> , which is the most lethal and devastating viral infection in history , first emerged among agricultural communities in India about 11 @,@ 000 years ago . The virus , which only infected humans , probably descended from the <unk> of rodents . <unk> probably came into contact with these rodents , and some people became infected by the viruses they carried . When viruses cross this so @-@ called " species barrier " , their effects can be severe , and humans may have had little natural resistance . Contemporary humans lived in small communities , and those who succumbed to infection either died or developed immunity . This acquired immunity is only passed down to offspring temporarily , by antibodies in breast milk and other antibodies that cross the <unk> from the mother 's blood to the <unk> child 's . Therefore , sporadic outbreaks probably occurred in each generation . In about 9000 BC , when many people began to settle on the fertile flood plains of the River Nile , the population became dense enough for the virus to maintain a constant presence because of the high concentration of susceptible people . Other <unk> of viral diseases that depend on large concentrations of people , such as <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , also first occurred at this time . 
 The Neolithic age , which began in the Middle East in about <unk> BC , was a time when humans became farmers . This agricultural revolution embraced the development of <unk> and presented an opportunity for the rapid spread of several species of plant viruses . The divergence and spread of <unk> – southern <unk> mosaic virus – date from this time . The spread of the <unk> of potatoes , and other fruits and vegetables , began about 6 @,@ 600 years ago . 
 About 10 @,@ 000 years ago the humans who inhabited the lands around the Mediterranean basin began to <unk> wild animals . <unk> , cattle , goats , sheep , horses , camels , cats and dogs were all kept and bred in captivity . These animals would have brought their viruses with them . The transmission of viruses from animals to humans can occur , but such <unk> infections are rare and subsequent human @-@ to @-@ human transmission of animal viruses is even rarer , although there are notable exceptions such as influenza . Most viruses are species @-@ specific and would have posed no threat to humans . The rare <unk> of viral diseases originating in animals would have been short @-@ lived because the viruses were not fully adapted to humans and the human populations were too small to maintain the chains of infection . 
 Other , more ancient , viruses have been less of a threat . <unk> viruses first infected the ancestors of modern humans over 80 million years ago . <unk> have developed a tolerance to these viruses , and most are infected with at least one species . Records of these <unk> virus infections are rare , but it is likely that early <unk> suffered from <unk> , influenza and <unk> caused by viruses just as humans do today . More recently evolved viruses cause <unk> and <unk> – and it is these that history records . The influenza virus is one that seems to have crossed the species barrier from pigs to ducks and water <unk> and hence to humans . It is possible that a fatal plague in the Middle East at the time of the late 18th Dynasty was associated with this transmission at <unk> . 
 Among the earliest records of a viral infection is an Egyptian stele thought to depict an Egyptian priest from the 18th Dynasty ( 1580 – <unk> BC ) with a foot drop <unk> characteristic of a <unk> infection . The mummy of <unk> – a ruler during the 19th Dynasty – shows signs of <unk> , and that of <unk> V and some other Egyptian mummies buried over 3000 years ago show evidence of smallpox . There was an epidemic of smallpox in Athens in 430 BC , in which a quarter of the <unk> army and many of the city 's civilians died from the infection . 
 A <unk> infection <unk> lifelong immunity . Therefore , the virus requires a high population density to become endemic , and this probably did not occur in the Neolithic age . Following the emergence of the virus in the Middle East , it reached India by 2500 BC . <unk> was so common in children at the time that it was not recognised as a disease . In Egyptian hieroglyphs it was described as a normal stage of human development . One of the earliest descriptions of a virus @-@ infected plant can be found in a poem written by the Japanese Empress <unk> ( <unk> – 770 ) , in which she describes a plant in summer with <unk> leaves . The plant , later identified as <unk> <unk> , is often infected with <unk> yellow leaf <unk> virus . 
 <unk> to influenza infections date from the late 15th and early 16th centuries , but infections almost certainly occurred long before then . In <unk> , an epidemic occurred that was possibly the first in Europe , and in <unk> , an outbreak of what is now thought to be <unk> influenza , struck Native Americans in Hispaniola . There is some evidence to suggest that source of the infection was pigs on Columbus 's ships . During an influenza epidemic that occurred in England between <unk> and <unk> , five per cent of the population – about 150 @,@ 000 – died from the infection . The mortality rate was nearly five times that of the 1918 – 19 pandemic . The first pandemic that was reliably recorded began in July 1580 and swept across Europe , Africa , and Asia . The mortality rate was high – 8 @,@ 000 died in Rome . The next three <unk> occurred in the 18th century , including that during <unk> – 82 , which was probably the most devastating in history . This began in November <unk> in China and reached Moscow in December . In February 1782 it hit Saint Petersburg , and by May it had reached Denmark . Within six weeks , 75 per cent of the British population were infected and the pandemic soon spread to the Americas . 
 By the 18th century , smallpox was endemic in Europe . There were five <unk> in London between <unk> and <unk> , and large outbreaks occurred in other major European cities . By the end of the century about 400 @,@ 000 Europeans were dying from the disease each year . It reached South Africa in <unk> , having been carried by ships from India , and in 1789 the disease struck Australia . In the 19th century , smallpox became the single most important cause of death of the Australian <unk> . 
 In 1546 <unk> <unk> ( <unk> – 1553 ) wrote a classic description of <unk> . He thought the disease was caused by " seeds " ( <unk> ) that were spread from person to person . An epidemic hit London in <unk> , recorded by Thomas <unk> ( 1624 – 1689 ) , who thought it was caused by toxic <unk> emanating from the earth . His theory was wrong but he was a skilled observer and kept meticulous records . 
 Yellow fever is an often lethal disease caused by a <unk> . The virus is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes ( <unk> <unk> ) and first appeared over 3 @,@ 000 years ago . In 1647 , the first recorded epidemic occurred on Barbados and was called " Barbados <unk> " by John Winthrop , who was the governor of the island at the time . He passed quarantine laws to protect the people – the first ever such laws in North America . Further <unk> of the disease occurred in North America in the 17th , 18th and 19th centuries . The first known cases of <unk> fever occurred in Indonesia and Egypt in 1779 . Trade ships brought the disease to the US , where an epidemic occurred in Philadelphia in <unk> . 
 Many paintings can be found in the museums of Europe depicting <unk> with attractive coloured stripes . Most , such as the still life studies of Johannes <unk> , were painted during the 17th century . These flowers were particularly popular and became sought after by those who could afford them . At the peak of this <unk> <unk> in the <unk> , one bulb could cost as much as a house . It was not known at the time that the stripes were caused by a virus accidentally transferred by humans to <unk> from <unk> . <unk> by the virus , the plants turned out to be a poor investment . Only a few bulbs produced flowers with the attractive characteristics of their parent plants . 
 Until the Irish Great Famine of 1845 – 1852 , the <unk> cause of disease in potatoes was not the mould that causes <unk> , it was a virus . The disease , called " <unk> " , is caused by potato <unk> virus , and it was widespread in England in the 1770s , where it destroyed 75 per cent of the potato crop . At that time , the Irish potato crop remained relatively unscathed . 
 The experiment was repeated on eleven <unk> children , all of whom survived the ordeal , and by <unk> even King George I 's grandchildren had been <unk> . The practice was not entirely safe and there was a one in fifty chance of death . The procedure was expensive ; some medical practitioners charged between £ 5 and £ 10 and some sold the method to other practitioners for fees between £ 50 to £ 100 , or for half of the profits . <unk> became a lucrative franchise , but it remained beyond the means of many until the late 1770s . At the time nothing was known about viruses or the immune system , and no one knew how the procedure afforded protection . 
 At the turn of the 20th century , evidence for the existence of viruses was obtained from experiments with <unk> that had pores too small for bacteria to pass through ; the term " <unk> virus " was coined to describe them . Until the 1930s most scientists believed that viruses were small bacteria , but following the invention of the electron microscope in 1931 they were shown to be completely different , to a degree that not all scientists were convinced they were anything other than <unk> of toxic proteins . The situation changed radically when it was discovered that viruses contain genetic material in the form of DNA or RNA . Once they were recognised as distinct biological entities they were soon shown to be the cause of numerous infections of plants , animals and even bacteria . 
 Of the many diseases of humans that were found to be caused by viruses in the 20th century one , smallpox , has been eradicated . The diseases caused by viruses such as HIV and influenza virus have proved to be more difficult to control . Other diseases , such as those caused by <unk> , are presenting new challenges . 
 As humans have changed their behaviour during history , so have viruses . In ancient times the human population was too small for <unk> to occur and , in the case of some viruses , too small for them to survive . In the 20th and 21st century increasing population densities , revolutionary changes in agriculture and farming methods , and high speed travel have contributed to the spread of new viruses and the re @-@ appearance of old ones . Like smallpox , some viral diseases might be conquered , but new ones , such as severe acute respiratory syndrome ( <unk> ) , will continue to emerge . Although <unk> are still the most powerful weapon against viruses , in recent decades <unk> drugs have been developed to specifically target viruses as they replicate in their hosts . The 2009 influenza pandemic showed how rapidly new strains of viruses continue to spread around the world , despite efforts to contain them . 
 <unk> in virus discovery and control continue to be made . Human <unk> , which is a cause of respiratory infections including pneumonia , was discovered in 2001 . A vaccine for the <unk> that cause cervical cancer was developed between 2002 and 2006 . In 2005 , human T <unk> viruses 3 and 4 were discovered . In 2008 the WHO Global <unk> <unk> Initiative was re @-@ launched with a plan to eradicate <unk> by 2015 . In 2010 , the largest virus , <unk> <unk> was discovered to infect <unk> . These giant viruses have renewed interest in the role viruses play in evolution and their position in the tree of life . 
 <unk> virus was a major cause of death in the 20th century , killing about 300 million people . It has probably killed more humans than any other virus . In 1966 an agreement was reached by the World Health Assembly ( the decision @-@ making body of the World Health Organisation ) to start an " intensified smallpox eradication programme " and attempt to eradicate the disease within ten years . At the time , smallpox was still endemic in 31 countries including Brazil , the whole of the Indian sub @-@ continent , Indonesia and sub @-@ Saharan Africa . This ambitious goal was considered <unk> for several reasons : the vaccine afforded exceptional protection ; there was only one type of the virus ; there were no animals that naturally carried it ; the incubation period of the infection was known and rarely varied from 12 days ; and infections always gave rise to symptoms , so it was clear who had the disease . 
 Following mass <unk> , disease detection and containment were central to the eradication campaign . As soon as cases were detected , the victims were isolated as were their close contacts , who were <unk> . <unk> came quickly ; by 1970 smallpox was no longer endemic in western Africa , nor , by 1971 , in Brazil . By 1973 , smallpox remained endemic only in the Indian sub @-@ continent , <unk> and Ethiopia . Finally , after 13 years of coordinated disease surveillance and <unk> campaigns throughout the world , the World Health Organisation declared smallpox eradicated in 1979 . Although the main weapon used was <unk> virus , which was used as the vaccine , no one seems to know exactly where <unk> virus came from ; it is not the strain of <unk> that Edward <unk> used , and it is not a weakened form of smallpox . 
 The eradication campaign led to the death of Janet Parker ( c . 1938 – 1978 ) and the subsequent suicide of the smallpox expert Henry <unk> ( 1930 – 1978 ) . Parker was an employee of the University of Birmingham who worked in the same building as <unk> 's smallpox laboratory . She was infected by a strain of smallpox virus that <unk> 's team had been investigating . <unk> of the accident and having blamed himself for it , <unk> committed suicide . 
 Before the September 11 attacks on the United States in 2001 , the World Health Organisation proposed the destruction of all the known remaining stocks of smallpox virus that were kept in laboratories in the US and Russia . <unk> of <unk> using smallpox virus and the possible need for the virus in the development of drugs to treat the infection have put an end to this plan . Had the destruction gone ahead , smallpox virus might have been the first to be made extinct by human intervention . 
 Before the introduction of <unk> in the US in the 1960s there were more than 500 @,@ 000 cases each year resulting in about 400 deaths . In developed countries children were mainly infected between the ages of three and five years old , but in developing countries half the children were infected before the age of two . In the US and the UK , there were regular annual or <unk> <unk> of the disease , which depended on the number of children born each year . The current epidemic strain evolved in the first part of the 20th century – probably between 1908 and 1943 . 
 In London between 1950 and 1968 there were <unk> every two years , but in Liverpool , which had a higher birth rate , there was an annual cycle of <unk> . During the Great Depression in the US before the Second World War the birth rate was low , and <unk> of <unk> were sporadic . After the war the birth rate increased , and <unk> occurred regularly every two years . In developing countries with very high birth rates , <unk> occurred every year . <unk> is still a major problem in densely populated , less @-@ developed countries with high birth rates and lacking effective <unk> campaigns . 
 During the summers of the mid @-@ 20th century , parents in the US and Europe <unk> the annual appearance of <unk> ( or <unk> ) , which was commonly known as " <unk> <unk> " . The disease was rare at the beginning of the century , and worldwide there were only a few thousand cases per year , but by the 1950s there were 60 @,@ 000 cases each year in the US alone and an average of 2 @,@ 300 in England and Wales . 
 During 1916 and 1917 there had been a major epidemic in the US ; 27 @,@ 000 cases and 6 @,@ 000 deaths were recorded , with 9 @,@ 000 cases in New York City . At the time nobody knew how the virus was spreading . Many of the city 's inhabitants , including scientists , thought that impoverished <unk> @-@ dwelling immigrants were to blame even though the prevalence of the disease was higher in the more prosperous districts such as <unk> Island – a pattern that had also been seen in cities like Philadelphia . Many other <unk> countries were affected at the same time . In particular , before the outbreaks in the US , large <unk> had occurred in Sweden . 
 The reason for the rise of <unk> in <unk> countries in the 20th century has never been fully explained . The disease is caused by a virus that is passed from person to person by the <unk> @-@ oral route , and naturally <unk> only humans . It is a paradox that it became a problem during times of improved sanitation and increasing <unk> . Although the virus was discovered at the beginning of the 20th century , its <unk> was <unk> until the 1950s . It is now known that fewer than two per cent of individuals who are infected develop the disease , and most infections are mild . During <unk> the virus was effectively everywhere , which explains why public health officials were unable to isolate a source . 
 Following the development of <unk> in the mid @-@ 1950s , mass <unk> campaigns took place in many countries . In the US , after a campaign promoted by the March of <unk> , the annual number of <unk> cases fell dramatically ; the last outbreak was in 1979 . In 1988 the World Health Organisation along with others launched the Global <unk> <unk> Initiative , and by 1994 the Americas were declared to be free of disease , followed by the Pacific region in 2000 and Europe in 2003 . At the end of 2012 , only 223 cases were reported by the World Health Organisation . <unk> <unk> type 1 infections , 122 occurred in Nigeria , one in Chad , 58 in Pakistan and 37 in Afghanistan . <unk> teams often face danger ; seven <unk> were murdered in Pakistan and nine in Nigeria at the beginning of 2013 . In Pakistan , the campaign was further hampered by the murder on 26 February 2013 of a police officer who was providing security . 
 The human <unk> virus ( HIV ) is the virus that – when the infection is not treated – can cause AIDS ( acquired <unk> syndrome ) . Most <unk> believe that HIV originated in sub @-@ Saharan Africa during the 20th century , and over 70 million individuals have been infected by the virus . By 2011 , an estimated 35 million had died from AIDS , making it one of the most destructive <unk> in recorded history . HIV @-@ 1 is one of the most significant viruses to have emerged in the last quarter of the 20th century . When , in 1981 , a scientific article was published that reported the deaths of five young gay men , no one knew that they had died from AIDS . The full scale of the epidemic – and that the virus had been silently emerging over several decades – was not known . 
 HIV crossed the species barrier between <unk> and humans in Africa in the early decades of the 20th century . During the years that followed there were enormous social changes and turmoil in Africa . Population shifts were unprecedented as vast numbers of people moved from rural farms to the expanding cities , and the virus was spread from remote regions to densely populated urban <unk> . The incubation period for AIDS is around 10 years , so a global epidemic starting in the early 1980s is credible . At this time there was much <unk> and <unk> . The " out of Africa " theory for the origin of the HIV pandemic was not well received by Africans , who felt that the " blame " was <unk> . This led the World Health Assembly to pass a 1987 resolution , which stated that HIV is " a naturally occurring [ virus ] of undetermined geographic origin " . 
 The HIV pandemic has challenged communities and brought about social changes throughout the world . Opinions on sexuality are more openly discussed . <unk> on sexual practices and drug use – which were once taboo – is sponsored by many governments and their healthcare providers . <unk> on the ethics of provision and cost of anti @-@ <unk> drugs , particularly in poorer countries , have highlighted <unk> in healthcare and stimulated far @-@ reaching legislative changes . In developing countries the impact of HIV / AIDS has been profound ; key organisations such as healthcare , defense and civil services have been severely disrupted . Life expectancy has fallen . In Zimbabwe , for example , life expectancy was 79 years in 1991 but by 2001 it had fallen to 39 years . 
 When influenza virus undergoes a genetic shift many humans have no immunity to the new strain , and if the population of susceptible individuals is high enough to maintain the chain of infection , <unk> occur . The genetic changes usually happen when different strains of the virus co @-@ infect animals , particularly birds and <unk> . Although many viruses of vertebrates are restricted to one species , influenza virus is an exception . The last pandemic of the 19th century occurred in 1899 and resulted in the deaths of 250 @,@ 000 people in Europe . The virus , which originated in Russia or Asia , was the first to be rapidly spread by people on trains and <unk> . 
 A new strain of the virus emerged in 1918 , and the subsequent pandemic of Spanish flu was one of the worst natural disasters in history . The death toll was enormous ; throughout the world around 50 million people died from the infection . There were 550 @,@ 000 reported deaths caused by the disease in the US , ten times the country 's losses during the First World War , and 228 @,@ 000 deaths in the UK . In India there were more than 20 million deaths , and in Western Samoa 22 per cent of the population died . Although cases of influenza occurred every winter , there were only two other <unk> in the 20th century . 
 In 1957 another new strain of the virus emerged and caused a pandemic of Asian flu ; although the virus was not as <unk> as the 1918 strain , over one million died worldwide . The next pandemic occurred when Hong Kong flu emerged in 1968 , a new strain of the virus that replaced the 1957 strain . <unk> mainly the elderly , the 1968 pandemic was the least severe , but 33 @,@ 800 were killed in the US . New strains of influenza virus often originate in East Asia ; in rural China the concentration of ducks , pigs , and humans in close proximity is the highest in the world . 
 The most recent pandemic occurred in 2009 , but none of the last three has caused anything near the devastation seen in 1918 . <unk> why the strain of influenza that emerged in 1918 was so devastating is a question that still remains <unk> . 
 <unk> are viruses that are transmitted to humans and other vertebrates by blood @-@ sucking insects . These viruses are diverse ; the term " <unk> " – which was derived from " <unk> @-@ borne virus " – is no longer used in formal taxonomy because many species of virus are known to be spread in this way . There are more than 500 species of <unk> , but in the 1930s only three were known to cause disease in humans : yellow fever virus , <unk> virus and <unk> fever virus . More than 100 of such viruses are now known to cause human diseases including <unk> . 
 Yellow fever is the most notorious disease caused by a <unk> . The last major epidemic in the US occurred in 1905 . During the building of the Panama Canal thousands of workers died from the disease . Yellow fever originated in Africa and the virus was brought to the Americas on cargo ships , which were <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> that carries the virus . The first recorded epidemic in Africa occurred in Ghana , in West Africa , in 1926 . In the 1930s the disease re @-@ emerged in Brazil . Fred <unk> , an American <unk> ( 1893 – 1977 ) , discovered the importance of the sylvatic cycle of infection in non @-@ human hosts , and that infection of humans was a " dead end " that broke this cycle . Although the yellow fever vaccine is one of the most successful ever developed , <unk> continue to occur . In 1986 – 91 in West Africa , over 20 @,@ 000 people were infected , 4 @,@ 000 of whom died . 
 In the 1930s , St. Louis <unk> , eastern <unk> <unk> and western <unk> <unk> emerged in the US . The virus that causes La <unk> <unk> was discovered in the 1960s , and West Nile virus arrived in New York in 1999 . As of 2010 , <unk> virus is the most prevalent <unk> and increasingly <unk> strains of the virus have spread across Asia and the Americas . 
 <unk> are outbreaks ( <unk> ) of disease among non @-@ human animals . During the 20th century significant <unk> of viral diseases in animals , particularly livestock , occurred worldwide . The many diseases caused by viruses included foot @-@ and @-@ mouth disease , <unk> of cattle , avian and <unk> influenza , <unk> fever and <unk> of sheep . <unk> diseases of livestock can be devastating both to farmers and the wider community , as the outbreak of foot @-@ and @-@ mouth disease in the UK in 2001 showed . 
 Foot @-@ and @-@ mouth disease is a highly <unk> infection caused by an <unk> , and is classified in the same family as <unk> . The virus has infected animals , mainly ungulates , in Africa since ancient times and was probably brought to the Americas in the 19th century by imported livestock . Foot @-@ and @-@ mouth disease is rarely fatal , but the economic losses incurred by outbreaks in sheep and cattle herds can be high . The last occurrence of the disease in the US was in 1929 , but as recently as 2001 , several large outbreaks occurred throughout the UK and thousands of animals were killed and burnt . 
 The natural hosts of influenza viruses are pigs and birds , although it has probably infected humans since antiquity . The virus can cause mild to severe <unk> in wild and domesticated animals . Many species of wild birds migrate and this has spread influenza across the continents throughout the ages . The virus has evolved into numerous strains and continues to do so , posing an ever @-@ present threat . 
 In the early years of the 21st century <unk> in livestock caused by viruses continue to have serious consequences . <unk> disease , a disease caused by an <unk> broke out in sheep in France in 2007 . Until then the disease had been mainly confined to the Americas , Africa , southern Asia and northern Australia , but it is now an emerging disease around the Mediterranean . 
 <unk> viruses are those that have only relatively recently infected the host species . In humans , many emerging viruses have come from other animals . When viruses jump to other species the diseases caused in humans are called <unk> or <unk> infections . 
 Severe acute respiratory syndrome ( <unk> ) is caused by a new type of <unk> . Other <unk> were known to cause mild infections in humans , so the <unk> and rapid spread of this novel virus strain caused alarm among health professionals as well as public fear . The fears of a major pandemic were not realised , and by July 2003 , after causing around 8 @,@ 000 cases and 800 deaths , the outbreak had ended . The exact origin of the <unk> virus is not known , but evidence suggests that it came from bats . 
 West Nile virus , a <unk> , was first identified in 1937 when it was found in the blood of a <unk> woman . The virus , which is carried by mosquitoes and birds , caused outbreaks of infection in North Africa and the Middle East in the 1950s and by the 1960s horses in Europe fell victim . The largest outbreak in humans occurred in 1974 in Cape Province , South Africa and 10 @,@ 000 people became ill . An increasing frequency of <unk> and <unk> ( in horses ) began in 1996 , around the Mediterranean basin , and by 1999 the virus had reached New York City . Since then the virus has spread throughout the US . In the US , mosquitoes carry the highest amounts of virus in late summer , and the number of cases of the disease increases in mid July to early September . When the weather becomes colder , the mosquitoes die and the risk of disease decreases . In Europe , many outbreaks have occurred ; in 2000 a surveillance programme began in the UK to monitor the incidence of the virus in humans , dead birds , mosquitoes and horses . The <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) that can carry the virus breeds on the marshes of north Kent . This <unk> species was not previously thought to be present in the UK , but it is widespread in southern Europe where it carries West Nile virus . 
 In 1997 an outbreak of respiratory disease occurred in Malaysian farmers and their pigs . More than 265 cases of <unk> , of which 105 were fatal , were recorded . A new <unk> was discovered in a victim 's brain ; it was named <unk> virus , after the village where he had lived . The infection was caused by a virus from fruit bats , after their colony had been disrupted by <unk> . The bats had moved to trees nearer the pig farm and the pigs caught the virus from their droppings . 
 Several highly lethal viral pathogens are members of the <unk> . <unk> are filament @-@ like viruses that cause viral <unk> fever , and include the <unk> and <unk> viruses . The <unk> virus attracted widespread press attention in April 2005 after an outbreak in Angola . Beginning in October 2004 and continuing into 2005 , there were 252 cases including 227 deaths . 
 The <unk> virus epidemic in West Africa , which began in 2013 , is the most devastating since the emergence of HIV . The initial outbreak occurred in December 2013 in <unk> , a village in southern Guinea . Among the first victims were a two @-@ year @-@ old boy , his three @-@ year @-@ old sister , their mother and grandmother . After the grandmother 's funeral , which was attended by her family and <unk> , the disease spread to neighbouring villages . By March 2014 the outbreak was severe enough to raise the concern of local health officials who reported it to the <unk> Ministry of Health . By the middle of the year the epidemic had spread to <unk> and Sierra Leone . As of June <unk> , the World Health Organisation reported over 27 @,@ 000 cases of the disease , which had resulted in more than 11 @,@ 000 deaths . 
 The natural source of <unk> virus is probably bats . <unk> viruses are transmitted to humans by monkeys , and <unk> fever by rats ( <unk> <unk> ) . <unk> infections can be severe because humans often have no natural resistance to the infection and it is only when viruses become well @-@ adapted to new host that their <unk> decreases . Some <unk> infections are often " dead ends " , in that after the initial outbreak the rate of subsequent infections <unk> because the viruses are not efficient at spreading from person to person . 
 The beginning of the 21st century saw an increase in the global awareness of devastating <unk> in developing countries , which , in previous decades had passed relatively <unk> by the international health community . 
 Sir Peter <unk> ( 1915 – 1987 ) described a virus as " a piece of bad news wrapped in a protein coat " . With the exception of the <unk> , viruses had a well @-@ deserved reputation for being nothing but the cause of diseases and death . The discovery of the abundance of viruses and their overwhelming presence in many ecosystems has led modern <unk> to reconsider their role in the <unk> . 
 It is estimated that there are about <unk> viruses on Earth . Most of them are <unk> , and most are in the oceans . <unk> constitute more than 90 per cent of the <unk> in the sea , and it has been estimated that viruses kill approximately 20 per cent of this <unk> each day and that there are fifteen times as many viruses in the oceans as there are bacteria and archaea . <unk> are the main agents responsible for the rapid destruction of harmful algal blooms , which often kill other marine life , and help maintain the ecological balance of different species of marine blue @-@ green algae , and thus adequate oxygen production for life on Earth . 
 The emergence of strains of bacteria that are resistant to a broad range of antibiotics has become a problem in the treatment of bacterial infections . Only two new classes of antibiotics have been developed in the past 30 years , and novel ways of combating bacterial infections are being sought . <unk> were first used to control bacteria in the 1920s , and a large clinical trial was conducted by Soviet scientists in 1963 . This work was unknown outside the Soviet Union until the results of the trial were published in the West in 1989 . The recent and escalating problems caused by antibiotic @-@ resistant bacteria has stimulated a renewed interest in the use of <unk> and <unk> therapy . 
 The Human <unk> Project has revealed the presence of numerous viral DNA sequences scattered throughout the human genome . These sequences make up around eight per cent of human DNA , and appear to be the remains of ancient <unk> infections of human ancestors . These pieces of DNA have firmly established themselves in human DNA . Most of this DNA is no longer functional , but some of these friendly viruses have brought with them novel genes that are important in human development . <unk> have transferred important genes to plants . About ten per cent of all <unk> uses the products of genes that have been transferred to plants from blue @-@ green algae by viruses . 
 " all things " is the 17th episode of the seventh season of the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . Written and directed by lead actress Gillian Anderson , it first aired on April 9 , 2000 , on the Fox network . The episode is unconnected to the wider mythology of The X @-@ Files and functions as a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story . <unk> by 12 @.@ 18 million people , the initial broadcast had a Nielsen household rating of 7 @.@ 1 . The episode received mixed reviews from critics ; many called the dialogue pretentious and criticized the characterization of Scully . However , viewer response was generally positive . 
 The series centers on Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called " X @-@ Files " . Mulder is a believer in the paranormal . The skeptical Scully was initially assigned to <unk> his work , but the two have developed a deep friendship . In this episode , a series of coincidences lead Scully to meet Dr. Daniel <unk> ( Nicolas <unk> ) , a married man with whom she had an affair while at medical school . After <unk> slips into a coma , Scully puts aside her skepticism and seeks out alternative medicine to save <unk> . 
 The script for " all things " , the only episode of the series written by Anderson , was originally fifteen pages too long with no fourth act . It was only after Anderson worked with series creator Chris Carter and executive producer Frank Spotnitz that the script was finished . The cast and crew helped Anderson adjust to her directorial debut — the first time a woman directed an episode of The X @-@ Files . The episode makes heavy use of " The Sky Is Broken " , a song from <unk> 's 1999 album Play , as well as a <unk> . The episode has been analyzed for its themes of <unk> and feminist philosophy . 
 FBI special agent Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) is getting dressed in front of a mirror . As she leaves , her colleague Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) lies in his bed , half of his body covered by <unk> . The narrative flashes back to a few days earlier : Scully arrives at a hospital and , after a series of coincidences , meets her former professor , Daniel <unk> ( Nicolas <unk> ) , with whom she had an affair while attending medical school . He is ill and suffering from an <unk> heart condition . She questions whether she made the right decision to leave him and abandon her medical career to pursue a career in the FBI . She meets <unk> 's daughter , Maggie ( Stacy <unk> ) , who is extremely <unk> of Scully for the effect she had on <unk> 's family . 
 Mulder — on his way to England investigating heart <unk> @-@ shaped crop circles — calls Scully and asks her to meet a contact of his , <unk> <unk> ( <unk> Flynn ) , to obtain some information . As Scully speaks to Mulder on her <unk> while driving her car , a woman appears on a <unk> . Scully brakes hard to avoid hitting the woman . As she does so , she narrowly avoids colliding with a diesel truck . She realizes that , had the woman not stepped in her path , the truck would have killed her . When she later arrives at the house of <unk> , she observes that Scully is going through a personal crisis and tries to offer her guidance , but Scully is dismissive . 
 Later , Scully returns to apologize to <unk> and agrees to listen to her ideas . <unk> shares her knowledge of Buddhism , the concept of the collective unconscious , and the idea of personal <unk> . <unk> believes these concepts might explain these strange occurrences . After a confrontation with Maggie at the hospital , Scully walks through <unk> . Seeing the woman who appeared earlier at the <unk> , she follows her to a small Buddhist temple before the mysterious woman seemingly <unk> . Inside the temple , Scully has a vision of what is ailing <unk> . She returns to the hospital with <unk> to visit <unk> . 
 <unk> and a <unk> provide alternative treatment for <unk> , who fully recovers . He announces that he still wants a relationship with Scully , but she realizes she is no longer the same person she was those many years ago and rejects him . As she sits outside the hospital on a bench , Scully thinks that she sees the mysterious woman again , but it turns out to be Mulder . Later , the two agents sit in Mulder 's apartment talking about the events of the last few days . Mulder begins to speak more <unk> about what <unk> , implying that fate has brought them together but , when he turns to look at Scully , he sees that she has fallen asleep . 
 <unk> during the sixth season of The X @-@ Files , Anderson approached series creator Chris Carter and asked to write an episode . Anderson 's own beliefs in the power of spiritual healing and Buddhism provided inspiration ; she wanted to write a script in which Scully pursued a " deeply personal X @-@ File , one in which [ she ] is taken down a spiritual path when logic fails her " . She wrote the basic outline of what became " all things " in one sitting , and pitched the script to Carter the next day ; he later approved of the " personal and quiet " characteristics of the story . 
 The first draft of the script was 72 pages — 15 pages too long — and did not feature a fourth act . Carter and executive producer Frank Spotnitz worked closely with Anderson to finish the episode , although Carter and Spotnitz later acknowledged that the majority of the script " was all Gillian " . Despite her satisfaction with the final version , Anderson regrets a handful of the " necessary " script changes , most notably , the addition that Scully and <unk> 's affair was intimate . In the original script , the two came close to having an affair , but Scully ended the relationship when she discovered that <unk> was married . 
 In the commentary for the episode , Anderson elaborated on Scully and <unk> 's original backstory : after Scully and <unk> came close to having an affair , Scully left to study at <unk> to become an FBI agent . After she left , <unk> become depressed , and his family began to suspect the affair . The emotional turmoil was too much for <unk> 's wife , who killed herself , which made <unk> 's daughter , Maggie , resent Scully , as shown in the finished episode . Anderson felt that the removal of this backstory made it hard for the audience to understand why Maggie was so angry at Scully . 
 When Anderson first wrote the episode , she did not hint that Scully and Mulder had had sex . Spotnitz and the production crew , however , felt it was natural to suggest that Scully and Mulder 's relationship may have evolved into a romantic one . The idea of heart <unk> crop circles was included because Anderson wanted " whatever Mulder was involved in that took him away from me , away from Washington , to somehow tie into what it was that I was going through — the journey that I was going through " . As such , Anderson dedicated much of her time researching both crop circles and heart <unk> , but she later gave additional credit to Spotnitz , who she noted was also heavily involved during the researching process . 
 Around the same time that she approached Carter about writing an episode , Anderson was also receiving offers from several television networks to direct shows . She , however , had never directed before , and decided that she would first attempt to helm an episode of The X @-@ Files before branching out into other series . Anderson thus expressed her wish to direct the episode when she pitched the original idea for " all things " . Carter accepted her story , but did not appoint her as director until all the revisions and <unk> had been completed . Anderson worked with series director Kim Manners for the majority of the episode , later noting that if she had any questions , she would approach Manners first . To help Anderson , Manners gave her directing exercises , such as making a list of shots for every scene . The episode also marked the first time that a woman had helmed the direction of an episode of The X @-@ Files . 
 Anderson 's directing helped to <unk> the production , and the cast and crew worked more than usual to make sure that everything was in order for her . Production designer Corey Kaplan made sure that the episode featured a Buddhist temple at Anderson 's request , and casting director Rick <unk> helped Anderson choose the appropriate actors and actresses . <unk> later said that he particularly enjoyed working with Anderson , because it was " fun " for him to watch her go through the casting process , which was entirely new to her . On set , Anderson 's directing style was described as " right on the money " by Marc <unk> in his book all things : The Official Guide to The X @-@ Files , Volume 6 . He later wrote that " Anderson wielded a <unk> hand in her directorial debut , <unk> the actors to her will , making decisions on the fly , and handling the complex special effects sequences " . Fans of the show later wrote to express their appreciation of Anderson 's directing abilities . Anderson was also involved in post @-@ production editing , during which she was forced to cut the final conversation scene between Scully and Daniel <unk> by 10 minutes in order to meet the allotted episode length . 
 The meditation scene required clips from previous episodes to appear in flashback . Initially , Paul <unk> and the special effects crew cut the necessary scenes and placed them in animated bubbles . According to <unk> , at this point , the crew was just experimenting with ideas . Eventually , the crew decided that the bubbles were too " <unk> " , so they adopted a more standard slit @-@ scan effect . In order to create the sequence of Scully <unk> <unk> 's heart condition , Nicolas <unk> had to lie naked on a platform surrounded by a blue screen . A sphere was matched via motion control as a marker for a prosthetic beating heart that was crafted and filmed separately . The two shots were then combined . 
 Anderson wanted to include " The Sky Is Broken " , a song from <unk> 's 1999 album Play in the episode , having heard it while driving home from work . She later explained that the song 's lyrics " fit with [ the ] idea that was <unk> for the script " . Anderson crafted the first shot after the opening credits , which involved Scully getting ready while water <unk> from a sink , to create a " continuation of sound , rhythmic sound " , because it was important to the show 's musical aspect . Anderson and series composer Mark Snow worked together in post @-@ production ; after filming , she sent Snow several CDs of music and asked him for compositions that were similar in style and feel . A certain melody that the two worked on later became " Scully 's Theme " , which was not broadcast until the eighth season episode " Within " . " all things " also featured the use of the <unk> , an instrument that Anderson called " very <unk> " and " appropriate for this episode " . 
 When Mulder and Scully talk at the end of the episode , Mulder questions the fact that he left " town for two days and [ Scully ] spoke to God in a Buddhist temple and God spoke back " . Scully retorts that , " I didn 't say God spoke back " . <unk> proposes that this is an example of Scully 's rational scientific approach <unk> with her newer , <unk> <unk> . The two modes of understanding are not " to be seen ... as competing systems , but as complementary , as are Scully and Mulder themselves " . <unk> concludes that this is represented in the opening scene , in which Mulder and Scully are implied to have had sex . This is meant as a metaphor , showing the full merging of Scully 's and Mulder 's different philosophies into <unk> <unk> . 
 The episode originally aired in the United States on the Fox network on April 9 , 2000 , and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on Sky1 on July 9 , 2000 . In the U.S. , " all things " was watched by 12 @.@ 18 million viewers . It earned a Nielsen household rating of 7 @.@ 5 , with an 11 share , meaning that roughly 7 @.@ 5 percent of all television @-@ equipped households , and 11 percent of households watching television , tuned into the episode . In the <unk> , " all things " was seen by 580 @,@ 000 viewers , making it the seventh @-@ most watched program on Sky1 for that week . On May 13 , 2003 , the episode was released on DVD as part of the complete seventh season . 
 Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a " C " and called it " a curious failure " . He felt that the writing was " pretentious " and composed of " some weird , weird <unk> " . VanDerWerff wrote that , although the episode was unsuccessful , there was something so " pure and unadorned at its center that I can 't outright hate it " . Furthermore , he admired the show and Anderson for " making the attempt " . Kevin <unk> of <unk> gave the episode a negative review , critical of the script and characterization . He said , " nothing much seems to happen , and what does occur is substantially driven by coincidence and <unk> " . He did not like <unk> and disapproved of Scully 's philosophical " <unk> " , calling it " <unk> , and hard to reconcile with the determined <unk> she 's displayed over the years in the face of events no less strange than those that occur here " . 
 In their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson rated the episode one star out of five , calling the premise and characters dull . The two criticized Anderson for looking at the " <unk> of life too intensely " , which made many of the actors and actresses come off as <unk> . Furthermore , Shearman and Pearson were critical of Anderson 's directing style , calling it " pretentious " , noting that the plot 's significance was drowned out by unnecessary artistic <unk> and <unk> <unk> . Paula Vitaris from <unk> gave the episode a negative review , <unk> it one star out of four . She called Anderson 's directing " heavy @-@ handed " and <unk> the storyline because it " plays <unk> with Scully 's motivations and character as established in the past seven years " . 
 Not all reviews were negative . Tom <unk> , in his book <unk> , gave the episode a largely positive review and called it " wonderful " . He praised Anderson 's tenacity in presenting a darker moment from Scully 's past and favorably compared the episode to " The Sixth Extinction II : Amor Fati " in terms of character development . Kinney Littlefield of The Orange County Register wrote that the " <unk> , <unk> episode " was " not bad for Anderson 's first directing effort " . He did , however , comment that it was not as " <unk> as the episode about an alien baseball player that Duchovny directed " . The Michigan Daily writer <unk> <unk> , in a review of the seventh season , called the episode " interesting " . 
 While the episode received lukewarm reviews from critics , fans of the show reacted generally positively to " all things " , and the show 's producers received calls and letters from viewers stating that they " loved the vulnerability and quiet determination that Scully revealed in the unusual episode " . 
 Hurricane <unk> was an unusual and erratic hurricane that existed during September 1967 . The fourth named storm and hurricane of the 1967 Atlantic hurricane season , <unk> developed on September 8 off the east coast of Florida . It meandered until attaining tropical storm status , at which point the storm accelerated towards the northeast . On September 10 , <unk> intensified into a Category 1 hurricane on the modern @-@ day Saffir – Simpson Hurricane Scale . After moving out to sea , the storm turned westward towards the United States . A compact cyclone , <unk> weakened to a tropical storm shortly before moving ashore in the Mid @-@ Atlantic States . The storm ultimately dissipated on September 21 . 
 The storm , which ultimately made landfall near the Virginia – North Carolina border , produced high winds along the coast from New Jersey through North Carolina . A small boat sank off the coast of New Jersey , killing three of its occupants . Overall damage was estimated around $ 150 @,@ 000 ( 1967 USD ) , although the storm overall was considered beneficial . 
 The origins of Hurricane <unk> are traced back to an area of disturbed weather off the northeastern coast of Florida on September 4 . For several days , the low pressure system meandered as its central barometric pressure gradually fell . The storm is estimated to have organized into a tropical depression at 0000 UTC on September 8 . At the time , it was situated north of Grand <unk> Island . Drifting westward , the cyclone attained tropical storm intensity early the next day . <unk> turned northeastward and accelerated as it moved away from Florida . On September 10 , the tropical storm achieved hurricane force . Cold air became entrained into the hurricane 's circulation by September 11 , causing it to weaken to a tropical storm . However , its forward motion slowed and it once again strengthened . 
 The hurricane moved eastward , seemingly out to sea . However , an area of high pressure over New England began to steer <unk> westward on September 13 . The hurricane continued to strengthen , and it is estimated to have peaked with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) and a minimum air pressure of 973 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 73 inHg ) . It maintained these winds for approximately 18 hours , before weakening slightly late on September 14 . In his 2007 book " Hurricanes and the Middle Atlantic States " , Rick <unk> compared <unk> to the 1933 Chesapeake – Potomac hurricane , citing similar <unk> , tracks , and forward speeds . On September 16 , the storm weakened to a tropical storm in a colder , drier environment . As it turned southward , <unk> quickly weakened . Initial <unk> suggested the possibility for the storm to maintain its severity and move ashore between Maryland and New Jersey . 
 <unk> deteriorating , <unk> made landfall near the Virginia – North Carolina border , and moved south over land . It <unk> over open waters on September 17 , and at around the same time , it weakened to a tropical depression . It curved southeastward as a weak depression , and several days later it was still identifiable as a storm system south of the island of Bermuda . It dissipated on September 21 . <unk> had an unusual and <unk> track , described as " one of the most erratic storms ever observed " . 
 In advance of the storm , hurricane warnings were issued for much of the East Coast of the United States . For 19 hours , about 260 mi ( 420 km ) of shoreline was under an advisory . At least 400 people were evacuated from their homes in southern New Jersey and 6 @,@ 600 from Ocean City , Maryland . 
 <unk> was a small storm , although it brought high winds and moderate coastal flooding to some areas ; generally light rainfall was also observed . In North Carolina , 6 @.@ 09 in ( 155 mm ) of precipitation fell at <unk> . Flash flooding and the <unk> of storm sewers ensued in the southeastern portions of the state ; there were also losses to crops , especially corn , cotton , and tobacco . In Virginia , strong winds were reported along the coast , with gusts up to 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) at <unk> Island . Along the east coast of the state , winds damaged trees , roofs , signs , and billboards . In Maryland , similar impact occurred in Ocean City , with damage sustained to signs and billboards and tore the roof of a prefabricated home ; a city <unk> also sustained storm @-@ related damage . 
 A station at the Indian River Inlet in Delaware recorded a tide 6 @.@ 5 ft ( 2 @.@ 0 m ) above @-@ normal ; the highest sustained winds reported on land association with the storm , 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) , also occurred there . Atlantic City , New Jersey , recorded a peak gust of 39 mph ( 63 km / h ) , with rainfall amounting to 0 @.@ 53 in ( 13 mm ) . Damage from the storm was generally light . Off the coast of Ocean City , New Jersey , a cabin cruiser sank in 25 @-@ ft ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) seas . Three of the vessel 's occupants , a mother and her two sons , drowned . In Massachusetts , some small boats sank at the <unk> . At Ipswich Bay , 10 people required rescue after two boats capsized . Minor beach erosion was reported at Nantucket . Overall damage was estimated at $ 150 @,@ 000 , which was considered minor . The storm 's passage was considered beneficial , due to adding sand to beaches and providing favorable rains . 
 <unk> Burke <unk> ( 9 May 1892 – 13 February 1955 ) was a General in the United States Army and Commanding General of the Army Service Forces in World War II . As such he was responsible for the U.S. Army 's logistics . Following his death , the Washington Post lauded him as " one of the <unk> officers the United States Army has produced . " 
 <unk> graduated near the top of his United States Military Academy class of 1914 and was commissioned in the United States Army Corps of Engineers . During World War I he served with the <unk> Villa Expedition in Mexico and the American Expeditionary Force in France in logistical posts . He was also decorated for gallantry in the <unk> @-@ <unk> Offensive . 
 After the war he served in various engineering assignments . From 1936 to 1940 <unk> was head of the Works Project Administration in New York City , where he was responsible for a series of Great Depression relief works , including the construction of <unk> Airport . 
 As head of the Construction Division of the <unk> Corps in 1941 , <unk> took charge of the construction of a series of camps to house the large numbers of draftees who entering into the Army . Once again , <unk> was able to deliver vital projects on time . The most enduring of these projects was the <unk> , which is today one of the most recognizable buildings in the world . From 1942 to 1945 , <unk> commanded the Army Service Forces , the logistical arm of the United States Army . 
 <unk> Burke <unk> was born on 9 May 1892 in Little Rock , Arkansas , the only child of William Taylor <unk> , a physician , and wife Mary née Burke , a <unk> . The two of them opened <unk> <unk> , a girls ' finishing school in Washington , D.C. , in 1906 . 
 <unk> was appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point , New York by Congressman Charles C. Reid of Arkansas . He entered West Point in 1910 and graduated sixth out of the 106 cadets in the class of 1914 . Like other high @-@ ranking cadets of the period , he was commissioned a second Lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers . 
 <unk> traveled to Europe for his two months ' graduation leave and was in Paris when World War I broke out . <unk> to the U.S. Embassy in Paris for volunteer duty , he became an assistant to the military <unk> . He took charge of refugee funds and <unk> $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 to help American citizens to get back home . 
 On return to the United States , he was posted to an engineer battalion at Washington Barracks , DC . <unk> high marks in his Garrison Officers ' School examinations , he was promoted to 1st Lieutenant on 28 February 1915 . During the <unk> Expedition into Mexico in 1916 , he was for a time depot manager at Columbus , New Mexico , the main logistical base of the expedition . Later , he joined the expedition in Mexico , working on roads and as a supply officer . 
 <unk> returned to Washington Barracks to attend the Engineer School but his course was interrupted by the declaration of war by the United States on Germany on 6 April 1917 . The course was abruptly terminated and <unk> , along with hundreds of other junior officers , was ordered to appear before an examination board that would determine his fitness for promotion . Following a favorable report from the board , <unk> was promoted to captain on 15 May 1917 . He helped organize the 15th Engineers , a rail transport unit , at Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . In July 1917 this became the first engineer regiment to be sent overseas , arriving in England in July 1917 and France later that month . The 15th Engineers worked on a several construction projects , including a munitions dump at <unk> @-@ sur @-@ <unk> and an advanced depot and regulating station at Is @-@ sur @-@ <unk> . <unk> got his projects completed by working his men around the clock and deploying every available resource regardless of the cost . For his role , <unk> was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal . 
 He was promoted to major on 15 August 1917 and lieutenant colonel on 1 October 1918 . While visiting some friends at the <unk> Division , he volunteered his services to its chief of staff , Colonel John C. H. Lee , who accepted him as a temporary replacement for his Assistant Chief of Staff , G @-@ 3 , in charge of operations , who had been captured a few days before . For leading a three @-@ man patrol to inspect damage to a bridge some 600 yards ( 550 m ) in front of American lines , <unk> was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross . He was one of only nine American officers , including Douglas MacArthur , <unk> R. <unk> , <unk> E. Brett or William J. <unk> , to have been awarded both the Distinguished Service Cross and the Distinguished Service Medal in the First World War . A few days later Lee arranged for <unk> to be permanently assigned to the <unk> Division . 
 The <unk> Division returned to the United States in May 1919 but <unk> remained behind as Assistant Chief of Staff , G @-@ 4 , in charge of supply , of the U.S. Third Army , and the American Forces in Germany , as it was re @-@ designated on 2 July 1919 . There , he met Anna <unk> , the daughter of a Chicago businessman , who was there as a YMCA volunteer . The two were married in August 1919 . They had three children together , all daughters . While in Germany , <unk> also met Walker D. <unk> , a prominent New York corporate lawyer , whom he assisted with a survey of shipping and navigation on the Rhine River . <unk> reverted to the permanent rank of major on 1 July 1920 . 
 Returning to the United States in July 1920 , <unk> was posted to the Office of the Chief of Engineers in Washington , D.C. His war record earned him a place at the Command and General Staff College at Fort <unk> , reserved for the Army 's best and most promising officers . He once again ranked near the top of his class . After graduation he was posted to the 1st New York Engineer District but soon obtained leave to assist <unk> with a special study of navigation on the Rhine and <unk> Rivers on behalf of the League of Nations , essentially a continuation of the work that the two men had done in 1920 . He then attended the Army War College from 1925 to 1926 . 
 From 1926 to 1930 he was District Engineer , Washington , D.C. Engineer District . As such he became involved in a conflict between proponents of the development of hydroelectric power through <unk> the Great Falls of the Potomac River and the Maryland @-@ National Capital Park and Planning Commission . Despite his advocacy , the falls remain <unk> to this day . On 1 September 1930 , <unk> was transferred to the Lower Mississippi Valley Division as Assistant Chief Engineer . The next year he became assistant to , and then the District Engineer of the Memphis District . In 1933 , he teamed up with <unk> again , for an economic survey of Turkey , which culminated in a seven @-@ volume report . Named as District Engineer for <unk> , Florida , <unk> got behind a project to build the Cross Florida <unk> Canal . <unk> was chosen to head the project but although President Franklin D. Roosevelt allocated emergency funds for the canal in 1935 , opponents of the canal protested that it would cause seawater to <unk> into the groundwater , and work was stopped a year later . In the meantime , he was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 1 August 1935 . 
 In 1935 , <unk> was appointed as head of the Works Project Administration in New York City . Over the next three and a half years he spent $ 10 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 a month on Great Depression relief works . He worked with the local politicians and labor leaders . He upheld the right of workers to form unions and improved relations with left @-@ wing groups , once declaring that " I wouldn 't know a Red if I saw one , and wouldn 't do anything about it if I did " . The biggest project was the construction of <unk> Airport . <unk> established a reputation as a man who could handle projects involving hundreds of thousands of people and hundreds of millions of dollars . 
 In December 1940 , <unk> became head of the Construction Division of the <unk> Corps , and was promoted to the temporary rank of brigadier general on 29 January 1941 . His immediate concern was the construction of a series of camps — which were scheduled for completion by April 1941 — to house the large numbers of draftees who were then entering the Army . <unk> that time was more important than money , <unk> pushed the project through to completion . By February , he was responsible for a work force <unk> @,@ 000 people employed on military construction projects . The job was completed on time but over $ 100 million over budget . He was also responsible for constructing new facilities to hold stores and munitions , for which $ 700 million was allocated by December 1940 . By December , 375 projects had been completed and 320 were still under way , with a total value of $ 1 @.@ 8 billion . He accepted promotion to brigadier general in the Army of the United States on February 14 , 1941 with the date of rank of January 29 , 1941 . 
 <unk> still pursued his own designs , making important changes , including the addition of a fifth story . The outbreak of war led to a new urgency , and by May 1942 , some 13 @,@ 000 workers were working around the clock on the building , which was completed in early 1943 at a cost of $ 63 million , the overrun being caused by the emphasis on speed and the addition of the extra floor . For his work with the Construction Division , <unk> was awarded an oak leaf cluster to his Distinguished Service Medal . 
 <unk> hoped to become Chief of Engineers but was " not really in the running " , being too junior in rank . Instead , the job went to Brigadier General Eugene <unk> , the Assistant Chief of Staff , G @-@ 4 on the War Department General Staff . <unk> 's post was abolished on the transfer of the Construction Division to the Corps of Engineers . <unk> , who considered <unk> " a <unk> but ruthless " who " didn 't care who he hit " , selected Brigadier General Thomas M. <unk> to head the new Corps of Engineers Construction Division . 
 <unk> instead received <unk> 's former assignment , with promotion to the temporary rank of major general on January 28 , 1942 and was promoted to temporary lieutenant general on March 9 , 1942 . The posting was unusual because <unk> had never previously served on War Department General Staff . As Assistant Chief of Staff , G @-@ 4 , <unk> pressed for the adoption of a comprehensive Army Supply Program that would set targets and priorities for all Army production . Such a program could be used as the basis for requests for <unk> , for <unk> , and for <unk> scare materials . 
 According to military historian John D. <unk> , who served on <unk> 's Army Service Forces staff , <unk> was " impatient , tense , and decisive " . Some saw him as an " empire @-@ builder " . <unk> noted the opinion of an observer that : 
 A 1943 attempt by <unk> to abolish the Technical Services failed amid the <unk> and panic created by false rumors that he was being considered for the post of Chief of Staff if Marshall was sent to Europe to command the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force . <unk> sometimes pushed extravagant white elephant projects , such as the <unk> Road , which he continued long after the strategic <unk> behind it had faded . 
 <unk> understood logistics and its paramount importance in modern warfare , and he spared no effort to ensure that the American fighting man had all he needed for victory . Near the end of the war , <unk> was promoted to general on March 9 , 1945 . He was the very few officers to be promoted to that rank during the war who had not commanded combat forces overseas . 
 When <unk> 's retirement was announced in December 1945 , Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson issued a press release that read : 
 In organizing and directing the worldwide supply lines on which our troops depended for their offensive power , General <unk> performed a service without parallel in military history . He was completely dedicated to the task of winning the war in the shortest possible time and with the smallest cost in America lives , and the energy and ability he applied to his task contributed in great measure to the force of our attack and the speed of our victory . 
 <unk> retired from the Army on 30 April 1946 and moved to <unk> , Florida . His wife Anna had died in January , 1942 and he had married Mrs. Louise Hampton <unk> , a former student at <unk> , in March 1943 . <unk> accepted an offer to become president of <unk> , a Pittsburgh @-@ based company that mined coal and manufactured and sold coal @-@ based products . Applying the same managerial techniques that he had employed in the Army , he thoroughly reorganized the company , and doubled revenues and <unk> profits over the next five years . 
 The <unk> class , also known as the <unk> <unk> class , was a class of battleship of the Regia Marina , the Italian navy . The class was composed of four ships : <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . Only the first three ships of the class were completed , however . Built between 1934 and 1942 , they were the most modern battleships used by Italy during World War II . The <unk> @-@ class ships were developed in response to the French <unk> @-@ class battleships , and were armed with 381 @-@ millimeter ( 15 @.@ 0 in ) guns and had a top speed of 30 knots ( 56 km / h ; 35 mph ) . The design was considered by the Spanish Navy , but the outbreak of World War II interrupted construction plans . 
 The first two ships , <unk> and <unk> <unk> , were operational by the early months of Italy 's participation in World War II . They formed the backbone of the Italian fleet , and conducted several sorties into the Mediterranean to intercept British convoys , though without any notable success . The two ships were repeatedly torpedoed throughout their careers : <unk> was hit by a torpedo during the attack on Taranto in November 1940 and again in June 1942 and <unk> <unk> was torpedoed during the Battle of Cape <unk> in March 1941 and while escorting a convoy to North Africa in September 1941 . <unk> joined the fleet in June 1942 , though all three ships remained inactive in La <unk> until June 1943 , when all three were damaged in a series of Allied air attacks on the harbor . 
 The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 allotted Italy an additional 70 @,@ 000 long tons ( 71 @,@ 000 t ) of total capital ship tonnage , which could be used in 1927 – 1929 , while other powers were observing the " holiday " in battleship construction prescribed by the treaty . France , which was given parity with Italy , also possessed 70 @,@ 000 tons of capital ship tonnage . Both countries were put under significant pressure from the other <unk> to use their allotted tonnage to build smaller battleships with reduced caliber main batteries . The first Italian design , prepared in 1928 , called for a 23 @,@ 000 long tons ( 23 @,@ 000 t ) ship armed with a main battery of six 381 mm ( 15 @.@ 0 in ) guns in twin turrets . They opted for this design because this allowed three ships under the 70 @,@ 000 @-@ ton limit . This would have allowed the Italian fleet to keep at least two units operational at any given time . Protection and radius of action were sacrificed for speed and heavy armament , though the Italians did not value range , as they operated primarily in the confined waters of the Mediterranean . 
 Later in 1928 , the design staff prepared another ship , with a displacement of 35 @,@ 000 long tons ( 36 @,@ 000 t ) , armed with six 406 mm ( 16 @.@ 0 in ) guns and protected against guns of the same caliber . At least one of these ships would have followed the three 23 @,@ 000 @-@ ton ships once the building holiday expired in 1931 . Funding was not allocated to begin construction , however , as the Italian Navy did not want to <unk> an arms race with the French Navy . The London Naval Treaty of 1930 extended the building holiday to 1936 , though Italy and France retained the right to build 70 @,@ 000 tons of new capital ships . Both countries rejected British proposals to limit new battleship designs to 25 @,@ 000 long tons ( 25 @,@ 000 t ) and 305 mm ( 12 @.@ 0 in ) guns . After 1930 , the Italian Navy abandoned the smaller designs altogether . By 1930 , Germany had begun to build the three <unk> @-@ class ships , armed with six 280 mm ( 11 in ) guns , and France had in turn laid down two <unk> @-@ class battleships to counter them . The French vessels were armed with eight 330 mm ( 13 in ) guns . In late 1932 , Italian constructors responded with a design similar to the <unk> class , but armed with six 343 mm ( 13 @.@ 5 in ) guns in triple turrets on a 18 @,@ 000 long tons ( 18 @,@ 000 t ) displacement . 
 The Italian Navy decided that the smaller design was impractical , and that a larger design should be pursued . A 26 @,@ 500 long tons ( 26 @,@ 900 t ) design was then prepared , which mounted eight 343 mm guns in twin turrets . This was ultimately abandoned in favor of a 35 @,@ 000 ton design to be armed with 406 mm guns . The 406 mm gun in turn was abandoned in favor of the 381 mm gun because there were no designs for the larger gun , which would delay construction ; a 381 mm gun had already been designed for the canceled Francesco <unk> class . Ultimately , nine 381 mm guns in three triple turrets were adopted as the primary battery for the ships , on a displacement in excess of 40 @,@ 000 long tons ( 41 @,@ 000 t ) , despite the fact that this violated the established naval treaties . Nevertheless , by the time these ships entered service , the international arms control system had fallen apart and the major naval powers had invoked the " <unk> clause " that allowed for ships up to 45 @,@ 000 long tons ( 46 @,@ 000 t ) displacement . 
 The ships ' main battery consisted of nine 381 mm L / 50 <unk> 1934 guns in three triple turrets , two in a superfiring pair forward and one aft . These long @-@ barrel , high @-@ velocity guns were chosen to compensate for the smaller 381 mm shell as compared to the 406 mm gun originally desired . The 381 mm guns had a maximum elevation of 35 degrees , which allowed them to engage targets out to 42 @,@ 260 m ( 138 @,@ 650 ft ) . The guns fired a <unk> kg ( 1 @,@ 951 lb ) armor @-@ piercing ( AP ) shell at a muzzle velocity of <unk> meters per second ( 2 @,@ 900 ft / s ) . High explosive shells weighed <unk> kg ( 1 @,@ <unk> lb ) . The high muzzle velocity of the guns reduced their service life and increased the <unk> of the fall of shot . Shell rooms were located below the propellant magazines beneath the gun house in the turret structure . The guns ' rate of fire was one shot every 45 seconds . 
 The ships ' secondary battery consisted of twelve 152 mm ( 6 @.@ 0 in ) L / 55 <unk> Model 1934 guns in four triple turrets . Two were placed abreast the No. 2 main battery turret and two on either side of the rear turret . These guns fired a 50 kg ( 110 lb ) AP shell at a muzzle velocity of 910 m / s ( 3 @,@ 000 ft / s ) . They could elevate to 45 degrees , permitting a maximum range of 25 @,@ 740 m ( 84 @,@ 450 ft ) . They had a rate of fire of slightly better than four rounds a minute . Four 120 mm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) L / 40 guns supplemented the 152 mm guns . The ships ' anti @-@ aircraft armament was composed of a powerful battery of twelve 90 mm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) L / 50 guns closely arranged amidships , twenty 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) L / 54 guns , and sixteen 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) L / 65 guns . The 90 mm guns provided long @-@ range anti @-@ aircraft protection , and were mounted in <unk> stabilized single turrets . They had a rate of fire of 12 rounds per minute and had a ceiling of approximately 10 @,@ 800 m ( 35 @,@ 400 ft ) . The 37 mm and 20 mm guns were designed for close @-@ range defense and had effective ranges of 4 @,@ 000 m ( 13 @,@ 000 ft ) and 2 @,@ 500 m ( 8 @,@ 200 ft ) , respectively . 
 The ships ' belt armor was designed to defeat 380 mm shells at ranges over 16 @,@ 000 m ( 52 @,@ 000 ft ) , and was inclined at 11 degrees . The belt was layered as follows : a 70 mm ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) hardened steel belt was used to de @-@ cap armor @-@ piercing projectiles . A 250 mm ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) wide gap separated the outer layer from the main belt armor , which was 280 mm ( 11 in ) thick and was backed with 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) of timber and 25 mm ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) skin plating . Another 140 mm ( 5 @.@ 5 in ) wide gap separated the main belt from a 36 mm ( 1 @.@ 4 in ) thick splinter screen . Another 25 mm thick screen was placed further <unk> . The main section of the belt armor was closed on either end by 70 mm ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) thick transverse bulkheads . The bow was protected by a 60 mm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) thick belt , while the stern was given 125 mm ( 4 @.@ 9 in ) of armor protection . 
 <unk> protection over the magazine consisted of a 162 mm ( 6 @.@ 4 in ) thick armored deck . Over the machinery spaces , the deck was reduced in thickness to 110 mm ( 4 @.@ 3 in ) , and on the <unk> portions of the ships , the deck was reduced further to 90 mm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) . The aft steering rooms and auxiliary machinery spaces were protected by a 105 mm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) thick deck . The main conning tower was protected by 50 – 130 mm thick side armor . 
 Above the deck , the main battery barbettes that housed the turret assemblies for the 381 mm guns were protected with 350 mm ( 14 in ) thick armor , while below deck the thickness was reduced to 280 mm . The faces of the main battery turrets were 350 mm thick , with 200 mm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) thick sides and roofs . The secondary gun turrets were housed in barbettes 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) thick above deck and 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) thick below deck . The turret faces were 280 mm thick , with 70 mm ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) thick sides . Below the third deck , neither the primary nor secondary barbettes were protected by armor . The anti @-@ aircraft guns were protected with gun shields ranging in thickness from 12 mm ( 0 @.@ 47 in ) to 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) . 
 All four ships incorporated a unique underwater protection system named after its designer , <unk> Pugliese . A 40 mm thick torpedo bulkhead extended <unk> from the base of the main belt before curving down to meet the bottom of the hull . This formed a void which housed an empty drum 380 mm ( 15 in ) wide with 6 mm ( 0 @.@ 24 in ) thick walls ; the rest of the void was filled with liquid . The drum ran the length of the torpedo defense system , and was designed to collapse to contain the explosive pressure of a torpedo hit . The torpedo bulkhead would prevent any splinters or explosive effects from entering the ships ' <unk> . The system was designed to protect the ship from torpedo warheads up to 350 kg ( 770 lb ) . 
 The system did not perform as effectively as expected , however . This was due to two major defects in the design . The riveted joint that connected the interior torpedo bulkhead to the bottom of the hull was not strong enough to sustain the tremendous shear <unk> associated with direct contact explosions . The joints failed even in cases of non @-@ contact explosions ; this prevented the hollow drum from collapsing as designed and resulted in massive flooding . The <unk> of the hull shape prevented the 380 mm thickness from being maintained for the entire central citadel ; the width of the drum was reduced significantly abreast of the main battery , down to 228 mm ( 9 @.@ 0 in ) . The ability of the drum to absorb explosive shock <unk> fell in relation to its size . 
 Two additional ships were laid down four years later . <unk> was built by the <unk> shipyard , starting on 18 September 1938 . She was launched on 9 June 1940 and was completed on 14 June 1942 , after which she joined the fleet in La <unk> and replaced <unk> as the fleet flagship . <unk> was laid down at the <unk> shipyard on 14 May 1938 . She was launched on 15 November 1939 , but she was never completed . After the entrance of Italy to World War II , the Italian Navy moved the unfinished ship from Genoa to Brindisi , out of fears of French attacks on the vessel . Work was not resumed . 
 <unk> and <unk> <unk> were declared operational on 2 August 1940 , and were assigned to the 9th Division of the 1st Squadron . On 31 August , the two ships , along with three of the older battleships steamed with a force of ten cruisers and thirty @-@ one destroyers to engage the Operation Hats convoy , but poor reconnaissance prevented the Italian force from engaging the British ships . The ships made another unsuccessful sortie to attack another Malta convoy on 29 September . During the attack on Taranto on 12 November 1940 , <unk> was hit twice by torpedoes , suffering serious damage . Significant flooding caused the ship to settle by the bow . The ship was dry @-@ docked on 11 December , with repairs completed by 11 March 1941 . <unk> <unk> , however , emerged from the attack undamaged . While her sister was being repaired , she took over flagship duties and was transferred to Naples . 
 On 26 March 1941 , <unk> <unk> departed port to attack British convoys to Greece . Germany pressured the Italian Navy to begin the operation , under the impression that they had disabled two of the three battleships assigned to the British Mediterranean Fleet . This resulted in the Battle of Cape <unk> the following day , during which <unk> <unk> engaged British cruisers . She was then attacked by torpedo bombers from HMS <unk> ; the first wave failed , but the second scored a single hit on both <unk> <unk> and the heavy cruiser Pola . The battleship was flooded with some 4 @,@ 000 t ( 3 @,@ 900 long tons ; 4 @,@ 400 short tons ) of water , though she got underway after ten minutes and eventually reached Taranto on 29 March . <unk> lasted until July . 
 In June 1943 , a series of Allied air raids attacked La <unk> in an attempt to neutralize the three battleships . On 5 June , she was hit by two large bombs that struck her port side . She was transferred to Genoa for repairs , which were not completed before the Armistice that ended Italian participation in the war . <unk> was hit by three bombs on 19 June , a week after her sister was damaged . She was renamed <unk> after <unk> <unk> 's regime collapsed . <unk> was damaged during the 5 June attack and again in a third attack on 23 June . In September 1943 , following the withdrawal of Italy from the war , all three ships and a significant portion of the Italian fleet left port to be interned in Malta . While en route , German bombers laden with <unk> @-@ X radio @-@ guided bombs attacked the formation . One hit <unk> in the bow forward the main battery turrets , causing serious damage . Two hit <unk> ; one passed through the ship and exploded under her keel , and the second hit near the forward magazines . The bomb detonated the magazines , causing a massive explosion that destroyed the ship with heavy casualties . 
 In 1939 , Spain 's General Francisco Franco briefly considered a naval building program after seizing power in the Spanish Civil War . Franco concluded several agreements with the Italian government that would have seen the building of four <unk> @-@ class battleships in Spain . The Italians promised to provide all necessary technical and material support for the construction of the ships . The Italian Navy pushed to modernize and <unk> the existing shipyards in Spain , so that they could handle a vessel as large as the <unk> class . The project was abandoned after Italy became involved in World War II , and as a result of limited Spanish industrial capacity . 
 In the early 1930s , the Soviet Navy began a naval construction program , and sought advice from foreign <unk> for a new class of battleships . On 14 July 1939 , <unk> completed a design proposal for the Soviet Navy , for a ship largely based on the <unk> class , designated <unk> 41 . The design was for a 42 @,@ 000 t ( 41 @,@ 000 long tons ; 46 @,@ 000 short tons ) ship armed with nine 406 mm guns in triple turrets . The Italians did not <unk> the specifications of the Pugliese system and instead used a multiple @-@ torpedo bulkhead system . Regardless , the Soviet Navy did not use the <unk> 41 design as the basis for the Sovetsky Soyuz @-@ class battleships they laid down in the late 1930s . They were , however , equipped with the Pugliese system , the details of which were revealed through Soviet espionage . 
 In preparing the design for the Design <unk> type of battlecruisers in early 1940 , the Dutch Navy inspected <unk> <unk> , then under construction , in hopes of gathering some experience on the underwater protection system . The Italians refused to <unk> the details of the Pugliese system , however . 
 A typhoon is a mature tropical cyclone that develops in the western part of the North Pacific Ocean between 180 ° and 100 ° E. This region is referred to as the Northwestern Pacific Basin , and is the most active tropical cyclone basin on Earth , accounting for almost one @-@ third of the world 's annual tropical cyclones . For <unk> purposes , the northern Pacific Ocean is divided into three regions : the eastern ( North America to 140 ° W ) , central ( 140 ° to 180 ° W ) , and western ( 180 ° to 100 ° E ) . The Regional <unk> Meteorological Center ( <unk> ) for tropical cyclone <unk> is in Japan , with other tropical cyclone warning centers for the northwest Pacific in Hawaii ( the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ) , the Philippines and Hong Kong . While the <unk> names each system , the main name list itself is coordinated among 18 countries that have territories threatened by <unk> each year . The Philippines use their own naming list for systems approaching the country . 
 Within the northwestern Pacific there are no official typhoon seasons as tropical cyclones form throughout the year . Like any tropical cyclone , there are six main requirements for typhoon formation and development : sufficiently warm sea surface temperatures , atmospheric instability , high humidity in the lower to middle levels of the <unk> , enough Coriolis force to develop a low pressure center , a pre @-@ existing low level focus or disturbance , and low vertical wind shear . The majority of storms form between June and November while tropical cyclone formation is at a minimum between December and May . On average , the northwestern Pacific features the most numerous and intense tropical cyclones globally . Like other basins , they are steered by the subtropical ridge towards the west or northwest , with some systems <unk> near and east of Japan . The Philippines receive the brunt of the <unk> , with China and Japan being impacted slightly less . Some of the deadliest <unk> in history have struck China . Southern China has the longest record of typhoon impacts for the region , with a thousand @-@ year sample via documents within their archives . Taiwan has received the wettest known typhoon on record for the northwest Pacific tropical cyclone basins . 
 The term Typhoon is the regional name in the northwest Pacific for a severe ( or mature ) tropical cyclone , whereas hurricane is the regional term in the northeast Pacific and northern Atlantic . Elsewhere this is called a tropical cyclone , severe tropical cyclone , or severe cyclonic storm . 
 The Oxford English Dictionary cites several Oriental words from Persian and Chinese giving rise to two early forms in English : <unk> ( from Persian ) and <unk> / <unk> @-@ fun ( from Chinese ) . 
 The Ancient Greek <unk> ( <unk> , " <unk> , father of the winds " ) is unrelated but has <unk> contaminated the word . 
 A tropical depression is the lowest category that the Japan Meteorological Agency uses and is the term used for a tropical system that has wind speeds not exceeding 33 knots ( 38 mph ; 61 km / h ) . A tropical depression is upgraded to a tropical storm should its sustained wind speeds exceed 34 knots ( 39 mph ; 63 km / h ) . Tropical storms also receive official names from <unk> Tokyo . Should the storm intensify further and reach sustained wind speeds of 48 knots ( 55 mph ; 89 km / h ) then it will be classified as a severe tropical storm . Once the system 's maximum sustained winds reach wind speeds of 64 knots ( 74 mph ; 119 km / h ) , the JMA will designate the tropical cyclone as a typhoon — the highest category on its scale . 
 From 2009 the Hong Kong Observatory started to further divide <unk> into three different classifications : typhoon , severe typhoon and super typhoon . A typhoon has wind speed of 64 @-@ 79 knots ( 73 @-@ 91 mph ; 118 – 149 km / h ) , a severe typhoon has winds of at least 80 knots ( 92 mph ; 150 km / h ) , and a super typhoon has winds of at least 100 knots ( 120 mph ; 190 km / h ) . The United States ' Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) unofficially classifies <unk> with wind speeds of at least 130 knots ( 67 m / s ; 150 mph ; 241 km / h ) — the equivalent of a strong Category 4 storm in the Saffir @-@ Simpson scale — as super <unk> . However , the maximum sustained wind speed measurements that the JTWC uses are based on a 1 @-@ minute averaging period , akin to the U.S. ' National Hurricane Center and Central Pacific Hurricane Center . As a result , the JTWC 's wind reports are higher than JMA 's measurements , as the latter are based on a 10 @-@ minute averaging interval . 
 There are six main requirements for tropical cyclogenesis : sufficiently warm sea surface temperatures , atmospheric instability , high humidity in the lower to middle levels of the <unk> , enough Coriolis force to develop a low pressure center , a pre @-@ existing low level focus or disturbance , and low vertical wind shear . While these conditions are necessary for tropical cyclone formation , they do not guarantee that a tropical cyclone will form . Normally , an ocean temperature of 26 @.@ 5 ° C ( 79 @.@ 7 ° F ) spanning through a depth of at least 50 metres ( 160 ft ) is considered the minimum to maintain the special <unk> that is the tropical cyclone . These warm waters are needed to maintain the warm core that fuels tropical systems . A minimum distance of 500 km ( 300 mi ) from the equator is normally needed for tropical cyclogenesis . 
 Whether it be a depression in the Intertropical Convergence Zone ( ITCZ ) or monsoon trough , a broad surface front , or an outflow boundary , a low level feature with sufficient <unk> and convergence is required to begin tropical cyclogenesis . About 85 to 90 percent of Pacific <unk> form within the monsoon trough . Even with perfect upper level conditions and the required atmospheric instability , the lack of a surface focus will prevent the development of organized convection and a surface low . <unk> wind shear of less than 10 m / s ( 20 kn , 33 ft / s ) between the ocean surface and the <unk> is required for tropical cyclone development . Typically with Pacific <unk> , there are two outflow jets : one to the north ahead of an upper trough in the <unk> , and a second towards the equator . 
 In general , <unk> wind increases associated with the <unk> – Julian <unk> lead to increased tropical cyclogenesis in all tropical cyclone basins . As the <unk> <unk> from west to east , it leads to an eastward march in tropical cyclogenesis with time during that hemisphere 's summer season . On average , twice per year twin tropical cyclones will form in the western Pacific ocean , near the 5th parallel north and the 5th parallel south , along the same meridian , or line of longitude . There is an <unk> relationship between tropical cyclone activity in the western Pacific basin and the north Atlantic basin , however . When one basin is active , the other is normally quiet , and vice versa . The main reason for this appears to be the phase of the <unk> – Julian <unk> , or <unk> , which is normally in opposite modes between the two basins at any given time . 
 Nearly one @-@ third of the world 's tropical cyclones form within the western Pacific . This makes this basin the most active on Earth . Pacific <unk> have formed year round , with peak months from August to October . The peak months correspond to that of the Atlantic hurricane seasons . Along with a high storm frequency , this basin also features the most globally intense storms on record . One of the most recent busy seasons was 2013 . Tropical cyclones form in any month of the year across the northwest Pacific ocean , and concentrate around June and November in the northern Indian ocean . The area just northeast of the Philippines is the most active place on Earth for tropical cyclones to exist . Across the Philippines themselves , activity reaches a minimum in February , before increasing steadily through June , and <unk> from July through October , with September being the most active month for tropical cyclones across the archipelago . <unk> falls off significantly in November , although Typhoon <unk> , the strongest Philippine typhoon on record , was a November typhoon . The most frequently impacted areas of the Philippines by tropical cyclones are northern and central Luzon and eastern <unk> . A ten @-@ year average of satellite determined precipitation showed that at least 30 percent of the annual rainfall in the northern Philippines could be traced to tropical cyclones , while the southern islands receive less than 10 percent of their annual rainfall from tropical cyclones . The genesis and intensity of <unk> are also <unk> by slow variation of the sea surface temperature and circulation features following a near @-@ 10 @-@ year frequency . 
 Most tropical cyclones form on the side of the subtropical ridge closer to the equator , then move <unk> past the ridge axis before <unk> north and northeast into the main belt of the <unk> . When the subtropical ridge position shifts due to El Niño , so will the preferred tropical cyclone tracks . Areas west of Japan and Korea tend to experience many fewer September – November tropical cyclone impacts during El Niño and neutral years . During El Niño years , the break in the subtropical ridge tends to lie near 130 ° E , which would favor the Japanese archipelago . During La <unk> years , the formation of tropical cyclones , along with the subtropical ridge position , shifts westward across the western Pacific ocean , which increases the landfall threat to China and greater intensity to Philippines . Those that form near the Marshall Islands find their way to <unk> Island , Korea . 
 <unk> track ( or straight runner ) . A general westward path affects the Philippines , southern China , Taiwan , and Vietnam . 
 A <unk> , <unk> track . Storms <unk> affect eastern Philippines , eastern China , Taiwan , Korea , Japan , and the Russian Far East . 
 <unk> track . From point of origin , the storm follows a northerly direction , only affecting small islands . 
 A rare few storms , like Hurricane John , were redesignated as <unk> as its track originated from the Eastern / Central Pacific and moved its way into the western Pacific . 
 Within the Western Pacific , <unk> Tokyo @-@ Typhoon Center , part of the Japan Meteorological Agency has had the official warning responsibility for the whole of the Western Pacific since 1989 , and the naming responsibility for systems of tropical storm strength or greater since 2000 . However each National Meteorological and <unk> Service within the western Pacific has the responsibility for issuing warnings for land areas about tropical cyclones affecting their country , such as the Joint Typhoon Warning Center for United States agencies , the Philippine <unk> , <unk> and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) for interests in the island archipelago nation , and the Hong Kong Observatory for storms that come close enough to cause the issuance of warning signals . 
 The list of names consists of entries from 14 Southeast and East Asian nations and the United States who have territories directly affected by <unk> . The submitted names are arranged into five lists , and each list is <unk> with each year . Unlike tropical cyclones in other parts of the world , <unk> are not named after people . Instead , they generally refer to animals , flowers , <unk> signs , and a few personal names . However , PAGASA retains its own naming list , which does consist of human names . Therefore , a typhoon can possibly have two names . Storms that cross the date line from the central Pacific retain their original name , but the designation of hurricane becomes typhoon . In Japan , people use the numerical designation of <unk> according to the sequence of their occurrence in the calendar year . 
 The most active Western Pacific typhoon season was in 1964 , when 39 storms of tropical storm strength formed . The least activity seen in the northwest Pacific ocean was during the 2010 Pacific typhoon season , when only 14 tropical storms and seven <unk> formed . In the Philippines , the most active season , since 1945 , for tropical cyclone strikes was 1993 when nineteen tropical cyclones moved through the country . There was only one tropical cyclone that moved through the Philippines in 1958 . The 2004 Pacific typhoon season was the busiest for Okinawa since 1957 . Within Guangdong in southern China , during the past thousand years , the most active decades for typhoon strikes were the 1660s and <unk> . 
 The Halo Original Soundtrack is a soundtrack for the video game Halo : Combat <unk> . <unk> and produced by Martin O 'Donnell and Michael <unk> for Bungie , the soundtrack was released on June 11 , 2002 . Most of the music from Halo : Combat <unk> is present on the CD , although some songs have been remixed by O 'Donnell in medley form for " more enjoyable " listening . The first piece O 'Donnell wrote , known as " Halo " , became the basis for Halo 's " signature sound " which has been heard in the other games of the main trilogy . 
 The soundtrack features a wide range of musical styles , including chanting , string orchestra , and percussion . Upon release , the soundtrack was well received by critics . Some complimented the wide range of musical styles , and most agreed that playing the game is not required to enjoy the soundtrack . A special edition of the soundtrack was released on October 28 , 2003 , featuring a DVD with a trailer , demo movie , and high quality music for Halo 2 . 
 As the audio director for Bungie , Martin O 'Donnell was tasked with writing the music for Halo : Combat <unk> . He had scored previous Bungie projects , including Myth : The Fallen Lords , while working for his audio company , <unk> , along with Michael <unk> . O 'Donnell was nervous about the project , saying he approached it , " with fear and <unk> " . O 'Donnell stated his main influences were music he liked — " a little Samuel <unk> meets <unk> <unk> " . Bungie 's Director of <unk> , Joseph <unk> told O 'Donnell , " the music should give a feeling of importance , weight , and sense of the ' ancient ' to the visuals of Halo " . 
 O 'Donnell 's first piece of music , " Halo " , which would become " the signature theme for Halo " , was written and recorded in three days . O 'Donnell convinced Alex <unk> to allow him to produce an original piece of music for the game 's 1999 <unk> Conference & Expo demonstration . He drew inspiration for the theme from The Beatles ' " <unk> " . O 'Donnell recruited <unk> and three other colleagues he had recorded <unk> with — Robert Bowker , Jeffrey Morrow , and Rob <unk> — to produce the " chanting monks " that open the piece . Originally , he had intended the <unk> accents to be sung by one of the professionals , but after singing an example of what he wanted , the others suggested using O 'Donnell 's own rendition instead . The theme premiered at the 1999 <unk> Conference & Expo . 
 The remaining themes were written , recorded , and produced throughout 2001 . The music was written with a variety of equipment including , " keyboards , synths , and <unk> as well as digital recording equipment controlled by computers " . Live <unk> , from members of the Chicago Symphony and Chicago Lyric Opera Orchestra , were added where needed . The soundtrack features a wide range of sounds , O 'Donnell described it as , " Gregorian chant , string orchestra , percussion and just a bit of a ' <unk> voice ' " . Working closely with level designers , O 'Donnell divided the music " into <unk> " . Based on these " <unk> " , " [ Halo 's ] audio engine could play [ the music ] back dynamically based on the player 's actions " . For the soundtrack release , O 'Donnell <unk> the music featured in the game in order to make listening to the soundtrack " more enjoyable " . 
 Bungie had previously released soundtracks for their games due to fan request , but Microsoft was hesitant to commit to producing a soundtrack for Halo ; at the time most video games did not get a commercial soundtrack release . The publisher finally relented after pressure from O 'Donnell and the outside <unk> of musician Nile <unk> . 
 Reception of the soundtrack was generally positive from critics . IGN praised the soundtrack for its wide use of instruments stating , " Where other <unk> scores tend to miss their mark when combining electronic and organic elements , O 'Donnell and <unk> seem to have found a rather stable balance between the two <unk> sounds . " Adding , overall , the soundtrack is " one of the better <unk> oriented musical experiences out there " and playing the game is not required to find enjoyment within the score . Reviewing for <unk> At Play , Michael Johnson called the soundtrack " 66 minutes of orchestral <unk> " citing the wide range of music covered as a strong point . <unk> gave the soundtrack 9 out of 10 , stating , " the soundtrack is a welcome and <unk> reminder of good times had blasting <unk> alien hordes " . The release went on to sell over 40 @,@ 000 copies . 
 <unk> Dale II is a role @-@ playing video game developed by Black Isle Studios and published by <unk> Entertainment , released on August 27 , 2002 . Like its 2000 predecessor <unk> Dale , the game is set in the Forgotten <unk> fantasy setting in the <unk> Dale region . The player assumes control of a group of mercenaries in a war between the Ten Towns of <unk> Dale and a coalition of persecuted races and religions . 
 The game is designed as an action @-@ oriented alternative to other Infinity Engine games , with less emphasis on exploration and story . It uses a real @-@ time adaptation of the <unk> & Dragons ( D & D ) Third Edition <unk> . The Infinity Engine was extensively modified to comply with the Third Edition , but the team was forced to remove certain rules because of the engine 's outdated nature . It was the final game to be developed using the Infinity Engine . 
 The game was well received by critics , who praised its combat , pacing , and use of the Third Edition rules . However , some reviewers felt that the graphics and engine had become outdated , and could not compete with its contemporaries . 
 <unk> Dale II is a real @-@ time adaptation of the D & D Third Edition <unk> . The game is viewed from an isometric perspective , and a head @-@ up display ( <unk> ) occupies the bottom of the screen . <unk> from the <unk> are an <unk> and a journal that records quests and important events . The player uses a point @-@ and @-@ click interface to interact with the game ; for example , clicking on the ground moves the selected player character , and clicking on a passive non @-@ player character ( <unk> ) will initiate dialogue . When conversations occur , the game presents multiple dialogue options . The game world is separated into area maps — obscured by fog of war — that are revealed as the area is explored . A multiplayer mode is available for up to six players over a local area network or the Internet . The " Heart of Fury " mode is also available , which increases the game 's difficulty and contains more powerful items . The game features over seven hundred items ; the designers included a system that <unk> the items the player obtains from enemies . 
 <unk> Dale II 's gameplay is focused on combat . The combat system is a real @-@ time adaptation of the turn @-@ based system used in D & D Third Edition , which caused the developers to remove certain aspects , such as " attacks of opportunity " . <unk> rolls are simulated by the game . In place of the turn @-@ based rounds used in D & D , characters have independent rounds , during which they may execute one or more actions , depending on such factors as the duration of the action . The player can pause the game and issue orders to characters at any time . Each character can carry a limited amount of items . 
 The game begins as the player 's group of mercenaries arrives by ship to defend <unk> . They report to the town palisade and fend off an assault by the <unk> army . Afterwards , the mayor of <unk> orders them to start an offensive on the <unk> army . The group kills the chieftain of the army , and discovers that he was under the command of a woman named <unk> . When they return to <unk> , the mayor asks them to rendezvous with reinforcements from <unk> . The group travels to meet them in an airship <unk> by Oswald <unk> . 
 J. E. Sawyer managed rule implementation , but the areas of the game were divided between designers . For example , designer Chris <unk> created the opening sequence , designer Dave <unk> developed the Black Raven Monastery and a large area of wilderness , and designers John <unk> and <unk> <unk> created the ending areas . Partway through development , Sawyer left the team to work as the lead designer on another internal project ; Dave <unk> and Chris <unk> were given his areas to finish . The developers wanted the game to contain more breaks from combat , with character interaction and puzzle solving , than the previous <unk> Dale . The decision to include more puzzles was influenced by the positive reception to the puzzles in <unk> Dale : Trials of the <unk> . 
 The game went gold on August 5 , 2002 , and was released on August 27 . After the release of <unk> Dale II , Sawyer expressed dissatisfaction over the <unk> Dale series , saying that , " I wasn 't particularly thrilled with how my work on [ <unk> Dale ] came out ... " and , " ... [ Heart of Winter ] managed to actually be worse than my <unk> Dale stuff . " In regards to <unk> Dale II he said , " [ It ] came out better than I expected , but still , not exactly <unk> @-@ inspiring . " Chris <unk> later said , " <unk> Dale was a fun series , but it didn 't try to set the bar for anything other than a fun romp . People may remember enjoying it , but it wasn ’ t trying to break any new ground or do anything revolutionary . In some respects , it was almost a step back from other games we 'd done and focused more on exploration and dungeon <unk> . " A Collector 's Edition containing bonus material , such as a full @-@ color cloth map and soundtrack CD , was also released . <unk> Dale II was the final game developed using the Infinity Engine . 
 The music was composed in five weeks , and the recording and mixing lasted three weeks . As the game 's music budget was low , a small Los Angeles orchestra was used to record the music ; the sound of the each instrument was doubled during production . <unk> <unk> described the music as having " some uniqueness to it , that basically it developed throughout the game [ with ] the [ inclusion ] of more instruments , taking <unk> and percussion and combining them with the standard orchestra . " <unk> later said , " I thought that we definitely met some high standards ; we compared our products to big budget films scores , " and , " in the end we were quite happy . " The game features voice work from Gabrielle <unk> , Peter <unk> , and Grey <unk> , among others . 
 Many reviewers praised the game 's combat and pacing . <unk> called the game 's combat " sublime , " and said that " no Infinity Engine game thus far has had such interesting and intricate tactical combat . " GameSpot called it " expertly paced . " PC Zone complained that certain gameplay mechanics had become outdated , but that " the only real <unk> is the <unk> spell system and the <unk> necessity to rest after every fight . " The game was also praised for its implementation of the Third Edition rules and interface . Computer Gaming World said that " <unk> II has the Third Edition rules down , and in no other place in the game is it more apparent than with character development , " and PC Gamer said it had " a dazzling implementation of the D & D 3rd Edition rules . " GameSpot called the interface " a big improvement on the spread @-@ out interface of all previous Infinity Engine games , " and IGN said that " the <unk> improvements to the interface that seem so natural , they make you wonder why they weren 't thought of before . " Game Informer called the interface " absolutely inspired " and its inventory system " second to none . " 
 Allen <unk> , writing for GameSpy 's 2004 retrospective " A History of D & D Video Games " , " While nobody would mistake it for " 2002 RPG of the Year " material , Black Isle Studios managed to give the Infinity engine a terrific game as its swan song . " 
 Wu <unk> ( Chinese : <unk> ; Wade – Giles : Wu <unk> @-@ <unk> ; 21 April 1917 – 9 April 2003 ) was a Chinese playwright , film director and social critic who has been called a " legendary figure in Chinese art and literary circles " . He authored more than 40 plays and film scripts , including the patriotic drama City of Phoenix , one of the most influential plays during the Second <unk> @-@ Japanese War , and Return on a Snowy Night , which is generally considered his masterpiece . He directed The Soul of the Nation , Hong Kong 's first colour film , based on his own historical drama Song of <unk> . 
 He was also well known as an outspoken critic of China 's cultural policies , both of the <unk> ( <unk> ) and the Communist governments , and was repeatedly persecuted as a result . He fled to Hong Kong in 1945 to avoid being captured by <unk> agents , and returned to Beijing after the foundation of the People 's Republic China in 1949 . He was denounced as a " <unk> " during the Anti @-@ <unk> Movement and performed hard labour in the " Great Northern Wilderness " for three years , and was again persecuted during the Cultural Revolution . His wife , the celebrated <unk> actress <unk> <unk> , refused to divorce him and became disabled after undergoing <unk> and penal labour . Despite these <unk> , Wu continued to criticize government censorship and to call for political freedom , and was widely admired for his moral conviction . 
 In 1935 , Wu entered <unk> @-@ French University in Beijing . The next year , a relative who was running a drama school in <unk> persuaded him to move there and teach at his school . There he met several people who would become prominent <unk> , including Cao Yu and Chen <unk> . 
 At the outset of the Second <unk> @-@ Japanese War in 1937 , Wu wrote the patriotic war play City of Phoenix ( <unk> ) , which made him well @-@ known in China at age 20 . It was one of the most performed dramas during the eight @-@ year war . He later wrote several critically acclaimed plays , including Return on a Snowy Night , which is generally considered his masterpiece . His works are strongly influenced by the May Fourth New Culture Movement . 
 After the Communist Party of China won the Civil War and established the People 's Republic of China in 1949 , Wu returned to Beijing . Like many intellectuals at the time , he held high hopes for the new People 's Republic which finally restored peace in a united China after decades of war and division . He wanted to return to writing plays , but was assigned by the government to direct Song of the Red Flag , a film about women textile workers . As he had no experience with factory life , it took him a year to finish the film , which he considered a " worthless failure . " He and <unk> <unk> divorced <unk> in 1950 , due to differences in personality and interests . 
 In 1951 , his friend Lao She introduced him to the famous <unk> opera performer <unk> <unk> , who had acted in one of Wu 's plays and admired his talent . They married that year , despite the fact that they were from differing <unk> backgrounds ; she had no formal education and was nearly illiterate , while he was from a prominent family of scholars . Wu helped her to study reading , writing , and calligraphy . 
 Wu returned to Beijing after three years of hard labour , but six years later , China fell into the even greater turmoil of the Cultural Revolution , which began in 1966 . <unk> <unk> and Wu <unk> were both denounced at the beginning of the period . She became disabled below her left knee after a severe beating . Their friend Lao She drowned himself after being similarly tortured . During the tumultuous decade Wu and <unk> both served years of forced labour . In December 1975 , she became <unk> after suffering a stroke , and Wu took care of her for the rest of her life . 
 After the end of the Cultural Revolution , Wu was politically rehabilitated in 1980 and inducted into the Communist Party , an event he described as " neither an occasion for laughter or tears " , and his publication ban was lifted after two decades . His play <unk> Players ( <unk> ) , based on <unk> <unk> 's experiences , was performed that year . In 1983 , Wu traveled to the University of Iowa in the U.S. to attend the International Writing Program . 
 <unk> <unk> died on 12 April 1998 , during a trip to <unk> , Wu 's ancestral hometown . He was devastated by the loss and his health quickly deteriorated . He suffered three <unk> in the next few years , and died on 9 April 2003 . 
 Wu <unk> and <unk> <unk> had three children . Their son Wu <unk> is also a writer , painter , and <unk> . After the deaths of Wu <unk> , he organized the exhibition " A Hundred Years of the Wu Family " at the <unk> Art Museum in Beijing . It was also held in France , Hong Kong , and Taiwan . 
 In the circumstances it was hardly possible for the new king to show <unk> or tolerance or diplomatic skill , which are the fruit of long experience in human relationships . <unk> with a desperate and chaotic situation he met it instead with <unk> determination and <unk> <unk> . Towards the end of his life , <unk> the affection and loyalty even of his courtiers and family he became a lonely figure , isolated by suspicion and <unk> . But , in spite of all , the name of this great defender of the faith is one of the most memorable in Ethiopian history . 
 Although he became Emperor in <unk> , <unk> <unk> was not crowned until <unk> at <unk> , where he resided for three years . It was not unusual for Ethiopian rulers to postpone their coronation until later in their <unk> . 
 He defeated <unk> ad @-@ Din , the Sultan of <unk> at the Battle of <unk> in <unk> , which consolidated his hold over the <unk> kingdoms in the south , as well as the weak Muslim kingdoms beyond the <unk> River . Similar campaigns in the north against the <unk> and the <unk> were not as successful . 
 After witnessing a bright light in the sky ( which most historians have identified as Halley 's Comet , visible in Ethiopia in <unk> ) , <unk> <unk> founded <unk> <unk> and made it his capital for the remainder of his reign . 
 At the time <unk> <unk> assumed the throne , the Ethiopian church had been divided over the issue of Biblical Sabbath observance for roughly a century . One group , loyal to the <unk> bishops , believed that the day of rest should be observed only on Sunday , or Great Sabbath ; another group , the followers of <unk> , believed with their founder that both the original seventh @-@ day Sabbath ( i.e. , Saturday , or Lesser Sabbath ) and Sunday should be observed . 
 <unk> 's goals as the senior male of his branch were to inherit and cement his father 's position in poetry , and to advance his own reputation ( thereby also improving the political fortunes of his own clan in the court ) . While his life would be marked by repeated illness and wildly shifting fortunes – only partially moderated by his father 's long @-@ lasting influence in court ( <unk> would live to the advanced age of 90 ) , the young and <unk> inclined <unk> Emperor Go @-@ <unk> 's patronage would prove to lead to some of <unk> 's greatest successes . 
 <unk> 's diary records that he looked forward to this chance to improve himself . He was 38 , and had reached middle age . While he was recognized as a talented poet , his career was stagnant ; he had been in the Palace Guards of the Left for twenty years , and had not been promoted for nearly 10 . He was " Lesser Commander of the Palace Guards of the Left " with little prospect of further advancement . 
 " I gather that it was probably not the Emperor who decided on the rules for the hundred @-@ poem competition . It was due entirely to the machinations of <unk> . One feels like <unk> him away in disgust . " 
 <unk> 's appeals to the <unk> <unk> failed , and so <unk> stepped in with an <unk> letter ( the well @-@ known <unk> <unk> ; " Appeal in Japanese " – writing in Japanese as opposed to the official Chinese was considered a mark of <unk> ) addressed to Go @-@ <unk> , arguing that such an exclusion was without precedent , and motivated by base jealousy on their opponent 's part : 
 " Of late the people who call themselves poets have all been <unk> . The poems they compose are unpleasant to hear , <unk> and lacking in <unk> . " 
 " Early this morning came a message from Lord <unk> that last evening the <unk> @-@ Emperor ordered my inclusion among the participants for the hundred @-@ poem sequences <unk> To have been added to the list for this occasion fills me with <unk> joy . Though they can hinder me no more , I am still convinced that the trouble was all due to the machinations of those evil men . And that it has turned out this way is a <unk> of all my hopes and prayers for this life and the next . " 
 This favorable patronage and collaboration eventually <unk> even as <unk> 's relation with Emperor <unk> and <unk> no <unk> deepened , over many things such as differences in how one should use " association and progression " ( as Brower terms it ) in poetic sequences . In 100 @-@ poem sequences and the like , the poems were usually in one of several groups ( the four seasons were common ones , as was love ) ; the poems generally formed an integrated sequence in which they dealt with the same subject matter , proceeding from stage to stage ( for instance , a sequence on Love might proceed from loneliness , to falling in love , to a mature relationship , and then the <unk> when it ends ) or which refer to elements of previous poems ( a technique later central to <unk> sequences ) . Go @-@ <unk> used such techniques consistently and often , whereas <unk> 's use was more erratic . During the compilation of the Shin <unk> , there were other differences , apparently over how wide @-@ ranging a net to throw for poems : 
 " In a situation like the present , where he [ Go @-@ <unk> ] has included poems by a great many people one has never heard of , whose names have remained in almost total obscurity for generations , and persons who have only recently begun to attract attention had as many as ten poems apiece included – in such a situation it is no particular distinction for me to have forty @-@ odd [ 46 ] poems chosen , or for <unk> to have a score or more . The <unk> @-@ Sovereign 's recent decisions make it appear he is choosing men rather than poems – a questionable procedure . " 
 In addition , there apparently were serious personality conflicts , which lead Go @-@ <unk> to write once , after praising <unk> 's poetry , that : 
 " The way <unk> <unk> , as if he knew all about poetry , was really quite extraordinary . Especially when he was defending his own opinion , he would act like the man who insisted a <unk> was a horse . He was utterly oblivious of others , and would exceed all reason , refusing to listen to anything other people had to say . " 
 ( The <unk> and horse <unk> refers to the ancient Chinese <unk> <unk> ( d . 207 BCE ) , who <unk> after an incident in which he brought a <unk> to the Imperial court , claimed it was actually a horse , and saw that more of the officials <unk> agreed with him , rather than the emperor who pointed out that the horse was actually a <unk> . ) 
 " Having been summoned to the palace for a poetry gathering on the thirteenth day of the second month in the second year of <unk> [ 1220 ] , I had <unk> to be <unk> because of a ritual <unk> , it being the anniversary of my mother 's death . I thought no more about it , but quite unexpectedly in the evening of the appointed day , the <unk> <unk> come with a letter from the ex @-@ emperor , saying that I was not the hold back on account of the <unk> , but was to come in any case . I continued to refuse , but after the ex @-@ emperor had sent two more letters insisting on my presence , I hastily wrote down the following two poems and took them with me . " 
 Go @-@ <unk> saw this attack as both <unk> of the <unk> sort and the culmination of a series of <unk> , this latest being petty resentment at what Go @-@ <unk> would have seen as a <unk> pretext for attempting to get out of the poetry competition . Accordingly , he banished <unk> from his court , a banishment that would last for more than a year ; this feud distressed devotees of poetry . 
 In <unk> , <unk> was advanced at the age of 70 to the court rank of " <unk> <unk> " ( Acting Middle <unk> . 
 But even <unk> 's improved fortunes could not <unk> him entirely from the various <unk> and disasters that <unk> the country in this period , and which greatly <unk> his illnesses : 
 " Today I had my servants dig up the garden ( the north one ) , and plant wheat there . Even if we only grow a little , it will sustain our hunger in a bad year . Don 't make fun of me ! What other <unk> does a poor old man have ? " ( <unk> , 13th day of the 10th month , 1230 ) 
 " <unk> people collapse , and their dead bodies fill the streets . Every day the numbers increase .... The <unk> has gradually reached my house . Day and night alike , people go by carrying the dead in their arms , too numerous to count . " ( <unk> , 2nd day of the 7th month , 1231 ) 
 During the later portions of his life , <unk> experimented with refining his style of <unk> , teaching and writing it ; in addition to his critical works and the manuscripts he studied and copied out , he experimented with the then @-@ very young and immature form of <unk> – " They are an amusement to me in my <unk> . " He died in <unk> , in <unk> , and was buried at a Buddhist temple named " <unk> " . 
 " In this art of poetry , those who speak ill of <unk> should be denied the protection of the gods and <unk> and condemned to the punishments of hell . " <unk> 
 <unk> is also remembered , like his father , as being something of an innovator – the <unk> Britannica says : 
 " <unk> employed traditional language in startling new ways , showing that the <unk> ideal of " old diction , new treatment " [ <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> ] inherited from <unk> might accommodate innovation and experimentation as well as ensure the preservation of the language and styles of the classical past . " 
 The " old diction " here are phrases and words from the " Three Collections " : the <unk> , the <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> <unk> , but not much older than that ( for instance , the diction of the Man <unk> was considered too old ) . <unk> wrote in his <unk> that the best poems were spontaneous and original , but nevertheless traditional : 
 " But such a notion is quite erroneous . For if we were to call such verses as that superior , then any poem at all we might write could be a fine one . No , first the powers of invention must be freed by <unk> endless possibilities over and over to oneself . Then , suddenly and spontaneously , from among all the lines one is composing , may emerge a poem whose treatment of the topic is different from the common run , a verse that is somehow superior to the rest . It is full of poetic feeling , <unk> in <unk> , <unk> , with <unk> above and beyond the words themselves . It is dignified in effect , its <unk> original , yet smooth and gentle . It is interesting , <unk> with an atmosphere subtle yet clear . It is richly evocative , its emotion not tense and nervous but sensible from the <unk> of the imagery . Such a poem is not to be composed by conscious effort , but if a man will only persist in <unk> practice , he may produce one spontaneously . " 
 The following is an example of how <unk> used old and classic imagery such as <unk> and <unk> , as well as pine and cherry trees , in fresh ways : 
 <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) ; <unk> 's personal anthology which includes over <unk> poems selected by himself . The two poems which offended <unk> Emperor Go @-@ <unk> so much and caused the rift between <unk> and him are preserved here only . 
 <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) ( c . 1235 " Single Poems by One Hundred Poets " ; this collection became the foundation of the modern Japanese New Year game <unk> . ) 
 <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) ( c . 1209 ; " Superior Poems of Our Time " ; a collection of poems <unk> felt to be excellent models , with a preface dealing with his critical philosophy , sent to <unk> to instruct him in how his poems should emulate the great ancient Japanese poets – teaching by example . This sequence was constructed when he was 47 , after the death of <unk> , which depressed <unk> , as evidenced by his writing in the <unk> <unk> that he had " forgotten the color of the followers of words ; the well @-@ springs of inspiration have run dry . " ) 
 <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) ( " The Tale of the <unk> Palace " ; an experimental novel believed to be written by <unk> , though <unk> 's manuscript claims that he was merely copying it . ) 
 <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) ( 1207 – 1213 ; an anthology of 286 poems , chiefly derived from the Shin <unk> ; long believed a forgery , but some modern scholars contend that it is a genuine work . )

M @-@ 30 crosses the county line near Edwards and continues northward . The highway turns to the northeast as it approaches West Branch , crossing under I @-@ 75 without an interchange . M @-@ 30 ends at Business Loop I @-@ 75 / M @-@ 55 on the west side of West Branch . 
 The Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) maintains M @-@ 30 like all other parts of the state trunkline highway system . As a part of these responsibilities , the department tracks the volume of traffic using its roads in surveys using a metric called average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) . MDOT <unk> the traffic level for a segment of roadway for any average day of the year in these surveys . For 2009 , the highest traffic levels were observed on the section north of US 10 at 7 @,@ <unk> vehicles per day . The lowest AADT levels were the 2 @,@ 952 vehicles between the M @-@ 61 junction and the <unk> – <unk> county line . The survey did not include the section south of US 10 . No segment has been listed as part of the National Highway System , a network of roads important to the nation 's economy , defense , and mobility . 
 M @-@ 30 was first designated by July 1 , 1919 . The original routing only ran from <unk> to West Branch . South of <unk> , the roadway is a portion of M @-@ 18 . An extension of M @-@ 18 in 1928 or 1929 south of <unk> led to the <unk> and extension of M @-@ 30 south through <unk> and Sanford to end at M @-@ 46 . M @-@ 30 was completely paved as the last 15 miles ( 24 km ) of gravel roadway were completed between Sanford and the Midland – Saginaw county line in 1961 . The next year , when M @-@ 30 was truncated to end at the US 10 freeway in Sanford , the remaining portion south of US 10 was turned over to county control . On May 13 , 2009 , the Midland County Road Commission ( <unk> ) and the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) signed a <unk> of Understanding that transferred control of Meridian Road south of US 10 to M @-@ 20 . The roadway transferred included a newly constructed bridge over the <unk> River and other segments of roadway rebuilt by the <unk> . 
 " Father 's Day " is the eighth episode of the first series of the British science fiction television programme Doctor Who , first broadcast on 14 May 2005 on BBC One . It was written by Paul Cornell and directed by Joe <unk> . 
 In the episode , alien time traveller the Doctor ( Christopher Eccleston ) agrees to take his companion Rose Tyler ( Billie Piper ) back to the day her father Pete ( Shaun <unk> ) died in 1987 . When Rose <unk> and pulls her father out of the path of a car , time is wounded and dangerous <unk> attack , threatening to erase history . Pete eventually learns that to get rid of the <unk> , he must throw himself under the car that was originally meant to kill him . 
 Lead writer and executive producer Russell T Davies conceived " Father 's Day " as an emotionally driven time travel story to explore Rose 's character . He chose Cornell to write the episode ; Cornell had been a successful writer of spin @-@ off material during the years the programme was on hiatus . The monster element of the story was expanded based on suggestions from Cornell and BBC Head of Drama Jane <unk> , and the <unk> went through many designs . The episode was filmed in November 2004 at St Paul 's Church and streets in Cardiff . " Father 's Day " was watched by 8 @.@ 06 million viewers in the United Kingdom and received generally positive reviews . Critics praised the focus on character and emotion . 
 The episode opens with a flashback of Jackie Tyler telling a younger Rose about her father Pete , who died in a hit @-@ and @-@ run accident on the way to a friend 's wedding . 
 In the <unk> , the Doctor agrees to take Rose to the day her father died so that she can be there when it happens . Upon their arrival in London on Saturday 7 November 1987 , they witness the accident , but Rose is unable to move when The Doctor tells her to go comfort her dying father . Rose asks the Doctor if she can try again , and the Doctor allows it but warns Rose to not run until their former <unk> have left to prevent a paradox . As the accident is about to happen , Rose suddenly runs out and pushes Pete aside , saving his life . The younger versions of the Doctor and Rose vanish . Rose and the Doctor fight about her actions , with the Doctor <unk> her for potentially damaging the timeline . The Doctor takes Rose 's <unk> key back and storms off without her . Rose decides to go with Pete to the wedding , while the Doctor walks back to the <unk> only to find that it is now an empty shell . Strange flying <unk> called <unk> appear and begin consuming people . 
 Rose and Pete drive to the wedding together , and the car that had been meant to kill Pete nearly <unk> with their car . They join the other guests , including Jackie who has brought the infant Rose with her . Rose is surprised to find that Jackie and Pete argue frequently . A young Mickey runs in to warn the guests about the <unk> , who think it is a joke until a <unk> appears above and attacks them . The Doctor runs to the church and directs everyone inside , noting that the age of the church will protect them against the <unk> . The Doctor explains to Rose that her actions have caused a paradox that normally the Time Lords would have prevented . Without them , the <unk> are <unk> the wound in time by consuming everyone within it . The Doctor further warns Rose not to touch her infant self , as it could cause further damage to time and allow the <unk> into the church . Feeling that his <unk> key is still warm , the Doctor sets it up in the middle of the church and the <unk> slowly begins <unk> around it . 
 While waiting in the church , Jackie sees Pete talking to Rose and thinks he is having an affair . Pete and Rose talk alone , and he comes to realise that she is his daughter . When Rose is unable to answer questions about how good of a father he was , Pete realises he was meant to die in the accident . Jackie thinks Rose is Pete 's daughter with another woman , and in a fit of frustration Pete hands the baby Rose to adult Rose . The paradox <unk> , and a <unk> is able to enter the church . The Doctor declares himself the oldest thing in the church and offers himself to the <unk> , who consumes him and disappears . The <unk> key goes cold and drops to the ground . Pete realises that they now have no other choice and that he must die in order to restore the timeline . He bids Rose and Jackie an emotional farewell , races out of the church and throws himself under the car that was originally meant to kill him . The timeline is repaired , and those previously consumed by the <unk> reappear . The Doctor sends Rose off to be with her dad as he dies , and she holds his hand until he is gone . Rose and the Doctor walk hand @-@ in @-@ hand back to the restored <unk> . 
 The episode ends with a flashback similar to the opening , as Jackie explains to a young Rose that Pete did not die alone . She tells Rose about a young woman who stayed with him until he died . In a voice @-@ over , the adult Rose <unk> her father . 
 Continuing the " Bad Wolf " arc of the series , a poster advertising a <unk> on a wall near where Pete was supposed to die in the beginning has the words " <unk> <unk> " <unk> it . Rose refers to the ending of this episode in " The <unk> of the Ways " , telling Jackie that she met her father and was the girl who held Pete 's hand as he died . Although Pete Tyler dies in this episode , an alternative universe version of him appears in the second series episodes " Rise of the <unk> " / " Age of Steel " and " Army of <unk> " / " <unk> " . 
 According to producer Phil <unk> , showrunner Russell T Davies came up with the concept for " Father 's Day " at an early stage in the planning of the series , as it was a " perfect time travel story " . Davies wanted the storyline to be easy @-@ to @-@ follow and drawn from human emotions . Additionally , the previous seven episodes had established why Rose was a good companion , and so " Father 's Day " shows that she does make mistakes , but in a relatable way . Davies chose Paul Cornell to write the episode ; Cornell was a successful writer of Doctor Who spin @-@ off material , especially in novels for the Virgin New Adventures , which <unk> the gap between the classic series and the new . Davies originally intended that the episode be a small budget @-@ <unk> character piece investigating the death of Rose 's father , but Cornell suggested the addition of the <unk> and BBC Head of Drama Jane <unk> encouraged the additions of monsters to the new series . Working titles for the episode included " <unk> Time " and " <unk> in Time " . Davies came up with the final title of " Father 's Day " in February 2005 , shortly before the series began airing . 
 Davies and Cornell debated whether it should have been Rose 's plan all along to save her father ; this is left ambiguous in the episode . Billie Piper felt that it did not occur to Rose until after she began travelling . In the original script , in the scene where the Doctor opens the <unk> doors and discovers only a police box interior , the police box fell apart . This was changed for reasons of cost , and Cornell has stated that he thinks the change is an improvement . Cornell also states that the character of Pete Tyler is based on his own father , who attempted many different jobs and schemes ( including , like Pete , selling health drinks ) before eventually finding success running a betting shop . Pete 's line " I 'm your dad , it 's my job for it to be my fault " is taken from something Cornell 's father once said to him . Originally Pete was to take a <unk> of wine before <unk> himself , but this was removed because a correlation between alcohol and bravery was not thought to be a positive message . 
 The entire episode was shot in Cardiff , in November 2004 . The weather changed frequently during filming , and the cast began to fall ill ; Eccleston had a cold . The production team selected several streets that looked similar . Most of the streets were in the community of Grangetown . The streets did not require much work for them to resemble 1980s streets ; only a few satellite dishes were taken down . The church is St Paul 's Church , also in Grangetown . The set of the Tyler 's flat was <unk> for the time period . For the 1980s style , members of the cast and crew brought in photographs of themselves from the ' 80s ; for example , peach dresses and " big hair " were incorporated , but these elements were not meant to be distracting . Camille <unk> , who played Jackie , wore a wig for this episode . Some of the conversation between Rose and her father in the car was cut because the car had made the dialogue delivery too " <unk> " . Piper was scared of holding the baby . Because the baby is present throughout the majority of the episode , but they were limited to how many hours they could work with the infant , an " artificial baby " was used as a <unk> in some scenes . 
 " The Lamb and Flag " , a pub from the sitcom <unk> , is referenced in the episode . When time is damaged , one of the effects is that mobile telephones all begin to repeat the message , " Watson , come here , I need you , " purportedly Alexander Graham Bell 's first words ever spoken over a telephone . However historical records believe the words to be " Watson , come here , I want you . " The error was not present in Paul Cornell 's original script , but <unk> in at some point during production . Producer Phil <unk> speculated that it was because the line was <unk> ; it was originally recorded by someone who the production team felt put on too false of a Scottish accent , and so it was <unk> with a real <unk> . 
 The episode features two hits from 1987 , " Never Gonna Give You Up " performed by Rick <unk> and " Never Can Say <unk> " performed by The <unk> , both of which have some relevance to the basic themes of the story . It also features the 2002 song " Don 't <unk> Yourself " by The Streets , indicating the damage to the timeline . Rose believes Pete to be " a bit of a Del Boy " , referring to the character from 1980s comedy Only <unk> and Horses . 
 " Father 's Day " was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on 14 May 2005 on BBC One . The episode received UK overnight ratings of 7 @.@ 47 million viewers , an audience share of 42 @.@ 74 % . When time @-@ shifted viewers were taken into account , the number rose to 8 @.@ 06 million . It received an <unk> Index of 83 . 
 " Father 's Day " was nominated for the 2006 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation , Short Form , alongside other first series episodes " <unk> " and " The Empty Child " / " The Doctor <unk> " . The latter won . " Father 's Day " topped the third place category in terms of votes . 
 Marshal of the Royal Air Force Cyril Louis Norton <unk> , 1st Baron <unk> <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , CBE , AM ( 15 February 1886 – 30 November 1963 ) was a senior officer of the British Army and Royal Air Force . He commanded units of the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Air Force in the First World War , and served as Chief of the Air Staff during the first years of the Second World War . From 1941 to 1946 he was the Governor @-@ General of New Zealand . 
 Born to a military family , <unk> studied at the Royal Military College , <unk> , before taking a commission as a junior officer in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment in 1905 . After transferring to the 2nd <unk> Rifles in the Indian Army , he saw active service on the North West Frontier , but after learning to fly in 1911 turned towards a career in military aviation . During the First World War he rose from flying instructor to command of 41st Wing RFC , the main strategic bombing force , and was awarded the Albert Medal for putting out a fire in an explosives store . 
 He served in staff positions through the 1920s and was Air Officer Commanding the Middle East Command in the early 1930s before becoming Air Member for Supply and Organisation in 1935 . <unk> was appointed Chief of the Air Staff in 1937 and , in that role , supported sharp increases in aircraft production , increasing expenditure on the new , heavily armed , Hurricane and Spitfire fighters , essential to re @-@ equip Fighter Command . However , he was sacked after the Battle of Britain after political intrigue caused him to lose Churchill 's confidence . In 1941 he was appointed Governor @-@ General of New Zealand , holding office until 1946 . 
 <unk> began to turn towards a career in aviation in 1911 , when he learned to fly in a Bristol <unk> at <unk> whilst on leave in England . He held certificate No. 144 issued by the Royal Aero Club . He later passed a formal course at the Central Flying School , <unk> in 1913 , and began working as a pilot trainer there from 17 November 1913 ; it was intended that he would form part of a flight training school to be established in India , but he had not yet left England when the First World War broke out . 
 On the outbreak of war , <unk> was in England . On 12 September 1914 , he was given the temporary rank of captain , and attached to the Royal Flying Corps as a flight commander , to serve with No. 1 Squadron on the Western Front . He was promoted to the permanent rank of captain on 22 September , effective from 16 August . On 24 March 1915 he was promoted to major and appointed to command No. 12 Squadron , flying <unk> aircraft in France from September onwards . The squadron took part in the Battle of <unk> , bombing railways and carrying out reconnaissance missions in October 1915 . 
 On taking command of the squadron , he chose to stop flying personally in order to concentrate on administration , a decision which was regarded <unk> by his men ; relations were strained until January 1916 , when he demonstrated his courage by walking into a burning bomb store to try to control the fire . He was awarded the Albert Medal for this act on the personal recommendation of General Hugh Trenchard , and in February 1916 was promoted to lieutenant colonel and given command of Training No. 6 Wing in England . In December 1916 he took command of No. 9 Wing in France , a long @-@ range bomber and reconnaissance formation , and in October 1917 took command of the newly formed No. 41 Wing . This was upgraded as the 8th Brigade in December , with <unk> promoted accordingly to the temporary rank of brigadier @-@ general on 28 December 1917 . During 1918 , it joined the Independent <unk> Force , which was the main strategic bombing arm of the newly formed Royal Air Force . In June 1918 <unk> was appointed the Deputy Commander of the Independent <unk> Force , serving under Trenchard . 
 <unk> was awarded the Croix d <unk> of the French Legion of Honour on 10 October 1918 , and appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George on 1 January 1919 , a Commander of the Order of the British Empire on 3 June 1919 and an Officer of the Belgian Order of Leopold on 18 April 1921 . 
 <unk> was granted a permanent commission in the Royal Air Force as a lieutenant colonel on 1 August 1919 and promoted to group captain on 8 August 1919 . He became Deputy Director of Personnel at the Air Ministry in August 1919 and then Deputy Commandant of the <unk> ' technical training school in August 1922 . He married May <unk> in 1922 ; she died in September 1924 , and he remarried the following year to Olive Foster , an American woman . He had three children with Foster , a son and two daughters . 
 <unk> was promoted to air <unk> on 1 January 1925 , and took command of the newly formed <unk> Air Force in May 1925 . He was appointed to a League of Nations <unk> committee in December 1925 and then became Deputy Chief of the Air Staff and Director of Operations and Intelligence on 12 April 1926 . He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1929 <unk> Honours and , having been promoted to air vice marshal on 1 January 1930 , he stood down as Deputy Chief on 6 February 1931 . He became Air Officer Commanding Wessex <unk> Area in February 1931 and then Air Officer Commanding Middle East Command in September 1931 . He then returned to the Air Ministry , where he became Air Member for Supply and Organisation on 14 January 1935 , during the beginnings of the pre @-@ war expansion and <unk> . He was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1935 <unk> Honours and promoted to air marshal on 1 July 1935 . He attended the funeral of King George V in January 1936 . 
 <unk> , <unk> remained a close follower of Trenchard during the interwar period ; his time in the Independent <unk> Force had left him convinced that strategic bombing was an exceptionally powerful weapon , and one that could not effectively be defended against . In this , he was a supporter of the standard doctrine of the day , which suggested that the destructive power of a bomber force was sufficiently great that it could <unk> an industrial economy in short order , and that so merely its presence could potentially serve as an effective deterrent . He was promoted to air chief marshal on 1 April 1937 . 
 On 1 September 1937 , <unk> was appointed as Chief of the Air Staff , the military head of the RAF , in succession to Sir Edward Ellington . The promotion was unexpected ; of the prospective candidates <unk> for the job , <unk> has been widely seen by historians as the least gifted . The most prominent candidate was Hugh <unk> , the head of RAF Fighter Command and senior in rank to <unk> by three months , who had been informally told by Ellington in 1936 that he was expected to be appointed as the new Chief of the Air Staff . The decision was taken by the Air Minister , Viscount <unk> , without consulting Ellington for advice . 
 During 1936 and 1937 , the Air Staff had been fighting with the Cabinet over the <unk> plans ; the Air Staff wanted a substantial bomber force and only minor increases in fighters , whilst the Minister for Defence Co @-@ ordination , Sir Thomas <unk> , successfully pushed for a greater role for the fighter force . <unk> was promoted during the middle of this debate , and proved perhaps more flexible than might have been expected . In 1938 he supported sharp increases in aircraft production , including double @-@ shift working and <unk> of factories , and pushed for the creation of a dedicated organisation to repair and refit damaged aircraft . He supported expenditure on the new , heavily armed , Hurricane and Spitfire fighters , essential to re @-@ equip Fighter Command . He even began to distance himself , albeit slightly , from orthodox bomber philosophy , noting to the Minister for Air that " no one can say with absolute certainty that a nation can be knocked out from the air , because no @-@ one has yet attempted it " . Discussing plans for reacting to a war with Italy , in early 1939 , he opposed a French proposal to force Italy 's surrender by the use of heavy bombing raids against the north , arguing that it would be unlikely to force the country out of the war without the need for ground combat . 
 <unk> was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the 1938 <unk> Honours . He was still Chief of the Air Staff at the outbreak of the Second World War on 1 September 1939 ; his main contribution to the war effort was his successful resistance to the transfer of fighter squadrons to aid the collapsing French thus preserving a large portion of Fighter Command which would become crucial during the Battle of Britain . While he remained committed to the idea of a " knock @-@ out blow " offensive by <unk> Command , he also recognised that it was too weak to do so successfully , but still strongly opposed the use of the RAF for close air support . 
 He was promoted to Marshal of the Royal Air Force on 4 October 1940 and retired from the RAF later that month . He was awarded the Order of Merit on 29 October , and made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George on 21 November . 
 In February 1941 <unk> was appointed Governor @-@ General of New Zealand , a post he would hold for the remainder of the war . His time there was mostly quiet – described by one biographer as " a nice long rest " – and he toured the country extensively , referring to the war " in every public address " . <unk> and his wife , who also carried out an extensive program of engagements , were broadly popular , but there were occasional tensions ; shortly after his arrival , it was widely ( but mistakenly ) rumoured that he had slighted the " men " of the Army in favour of the " gentlemen " of the <unk> in a speech . A <unk> , <unk> became Grand Master of New Zealand 's Grand Lodge while Governor @-@ General . 
 A second conflict emerged just before the end of his term , when in 1945 , the Labour government sought to abolish the country <unk> , a system that gave additional electoral seats in rural areas . <unk> groups – predominantly National @-@ supporting – strongly opposed the move , and argued that such a major change could only be made after gaining approval in a general election . <unk> <unk> , and advised Fraser to wait until after the election , but did not feel it was appropriate to intervene ; he <unk> to the bill . 
 Following his return from New Zealand in 1946 , <unk> was raised to the peerage as Baron <unk> , of Clifton upon <unk> , in the county of Warwick . He spoke in the House of Lords rarely , making five speeches between 1946 and 1948 and one in 1959 , mostly addressing defence issues . <unk> died at his home at <unk> Street in London on 30 November 1963 , at which time his son Francis inherited his title . 
 Five crew <unk> took place over the station 's lifespan , in late 1977 @-@ early 1978 , late 1978 , mid @-@ 1979 , mid @-@ 1980 , and early 1981 , including <unk> from Warsaw Pact countries as part of the <unk> programme . These crews were responsible for carrying out the primary missions of <unk> 6 , including astronomy , Earth @-@ resources observations and the study of the effect of <unk> on the human body . Following the completion of these missions and the launch of its successor , <unk> 7 , <unk> 6 was <unk> on 29 July 1982 , almost five years after its launch . 
 The <unk> of the two ports was fitted with <unk> to allow the station to be <unk> by <unk> Progress spacecraft . These <unk> , which brought supplies and extra equipment to keep the station <unk> , helped ensure that the crew were always able to carry out useful scientific work aboard the station . In all , twelve Progress flights delivered over 20 tonnes of equipment , supplies and fuel . 
 <unk> 6 's propulsion system experienced a serious <unk> during the second crew <unk> in 1978 and was not usable again for the remainder of the station 's lifespan . As a consequence , it was limited to firing its attitude control <unk> and visiting spacecraft had to perform orbital adjustments . After each crew <unk> ended , it was necessary for Progress and <unk> spacecraft to boost the station into a high orbit so it wouldn 't decay until the next <unk> began . 
 The primary instrument carried aboard the station was the <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> telescope , which could carry out astronomical observations in the infrared , ultraviolet and <unk> spectra using a 1 @.@ 5 metre @-@ diameter mirror which was operated in <unk> conditions at around − 269 ° C. The telescope could be operated only when <unk> 6 was on the night side of the Earth , and had its cover closed for the rest of the time . 
 The second major instrument was the <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> camera , which carried out Earth @-@ resources observations . An improved form of a camera first tested on Soyuz 22 , the camera captured an area of 165 × 220 kilometres with each image , down to a resolution of 20 metres . Each image was captured simultaneously in six bands in 1200 @-@ frame <unk> , which required regular replacement due to the <unk> effects of radiation . <unk> 6 also featured a <unk> @-@ 140 stereoscopic topographic mapping camera with a focal length of 140 <unk> , which captured images of 450 × 450 kilometres with a resolution of 50 metres in the visible and infrared spectra , which could be operated either <unk> or by the resident crews . The photographic capabilities of the station were , therefore , extensive , and the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture had planted a number of specifically selected crops at test sites to examine the capabilities of the cameras . 
 To further expand its scientific capabilities , <unk> 6 was equipped with 20 <unk> for observations , two scientific <unk> to expose equipment to space or <unk> rubbish , and various pieces of apparatus to carry out biological experiments . Later on during the flight , a Progress spacecraft delivered an external telescope , the <unk> @-@ 10 radio observatory , which incorporated a directional antenna and five <unk> . The antenna was deployed on the rear <unk> assembly , with the controller remaining inside the station , and was used for both astronomical and meteorological observations . 
 <unk> 6 was primarily supported by the manned Soyuz spacecraft , which carried out crew <unk> and would also have been used in the event of an emergency evacuation . The ferries docked automatically to the station , making use of the new <unk> automatic <unk> system , and were used by departing crews to return to Earth at the end of their flight . 
 The station was the first to be able to be <unk> by the newly developed <unk> Progress <unk> , although they could only dock at the rear port , as the front port lacked the <unk> used to refuel the propulsion system . The <unk> docked automatically to the station via the <unk> , and were then opened and emptied by the <unk> on board , whilst transfer of fuel to the station took place automatically under supervision from the ground . 
 In addition to the Soyuz and Progress spacecraft , after the final crew had left , <unk> 6 was visited by an experimental transport logistics spacecraft called <unk> <unk> in 1982 . The transport logistics spacecraft , known as the <unk> , was originally designed for the <unk> programme , and proved that large <unk> could dock automatically with space stations , a major step toward the construction of <unk> stations such as <unk> and the International Space Station . 
 The station received 16 <unk> crews , including six long @-@ duration crews , with the longest expedition lasting 185 days . <unk> crew missions were identified with an <unk> prefix , whilst short @-@ duration missions were identified with EP . 
 On 10 December 1977 the first resident crew , <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , arrived on Soyuz 26 and remained aboard <unk> 6 for 96 days . 
 On 15 June 1978 , Vladimir <unk> and <unk> <unk> ( Soyuz 29 ) arrived and remained on board for 140 days . 
 On 9 April 1980 <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> ( Soyuz 35 ) arrived for the longest stay on <unk> 6 , 185 days . While aboard , on 19 July , they sent their <unk> to the <unk> and wished them happy starts in the live communication between the station and the Central Lenin Stadium , where the opening ceremony of the 1980 Summer Olympics was held . They appeared on the stadium 's <unk> and their voices were translated via loud speakers . 
 A repair mission , consisting of <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> ( Soyuz T @-@ 3 ) worked on the space station for 12 days starting on 27 November 1980 . 
 On 12 March 1981 the last resident crew , Vladimir <unk> and <unk> <unk> , arrived and stayed for 75 days . 
 HMS <unk> was an armoured frigate built for the Royal Navy in the 1860s . Upon completion in 1864 she was assigned to the Channel Fleet . The ship was paid off in 1868 to refit and be re @-@ armed . When she recommissioned in 1869 , she was assigned as the guard ship of the Fleet Reserve in the Portland District until 1874 . <unk> was refitted and re @-@ armed again in 1874 and became the guard ship of the Liverpool District in 1875 . Two years later , she was rejoined the Channel Fleet before going to the Mediterranean in 1878 . The ship returned to the Channel Fleet in 1880 and served until she was paid off in 1885 . 
 <unk> was recommissioned in 1901 as a depot ship at Malta under a succession of different names . She was transferred to Chatham in 1914 and was again renamed multiple times before she was sold for scrap in 1923 . <unk> had more changes of her rigging and armament than any other British warship , before or since . 
 <unk> was the third member of the 1861 Naval Programme and was designed as an improved version of the earlier Warrior @-@ class armoured frigates with a complete waterline armour belt . 
 The ship was 380 feet 2 inches ( 115 @.@ 9 m ) long between <unk> , had a beam of 58 feet 3 inches ( 17 @.@ 8 m ) and a draft of 27 feet 2 inches ( 8 @.@ 3 m ) . She displaced 9 @,@ 820 long tons ( 9 @,@ 980 t ) and had a tonnage of 6 @,@ 121 <unk> . The hull was subdivided by <unk> transverse bulkheads into 106 compartments and had a double bottom . <unk> was designed with a high centre of gravity and was very stiff . So much so that the ship only rolled 10 degrees during one storm that ripped the main and <unk> <unk> masts off and split her <unk> . Because of her great length she was not very <unk> . <unk> had a crew of <unk> officers and enlisted men . 
 The ship had a single two @-@ cylinder trunk steam engine made by John Penn and Sons driving a single 24 @-@ foot ( 7 @.@ 3 m ) propeller . Ten rectangular boilers provided steam to the engine at a working pressure of 25 <unk> ( 172 <unk> ; 2 <unk> / <unk> ) . During her sea trials on 15 March 1865 , <unk> had a maximum speed of 14 @.@ 32 knots ( 26 @.@ 52 km / h ; 16 @.@ 48 mph ) from 5 @,@ <unk> indicated horsepower ( 4 @,@ 267 kW ) . The ship carried 750 long tons ( 760 t ) of coal , enough to steam 1 @,@ 800 nautical miles ( 3 @,@ 300 km ; 2 @,@ 100 mi ) at 6 @.@ 5 knots ( 12 @.@ 0 km / h ; 7 @.@ 5 mph ) . 
 As built , <unk> was ship @-@ rigged with four masts , called bow , fore , main and <unk> from fore to aft , and she was the only British warship ever to have four masts . They carried a total of 44 @,@ 000 square feet ( 4 @,@ <unk> m2 ) of sail area , excluding the <unk> , the greatest area ever spread in a British warship . Her performance was unsatisfactory when the wind was before the beam and her <unk> and <unk> were removed in June 1865 in an attempt to correct this problem . However , now she had too much weather helm so the <unk> was replaced and the foremast was moved forward 25 feet ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) in July 1866 . This reduced her sail area to 30 @,@ 133 square feet ( 2 @,@ 799 m2 ) . In 1877 <unk> was <unk> as a barque . Both of her funnels were retractable to reduce wind resistance while under sail alone . 
 The intended armament of <unk> changed no less than five times before it was finally mounted . She received four rifled 110 @-@ pounder breech @-@ loading guns mounted on the upper deck , two of which served as chase guns at the bow and stern , and 16 smoothbore , muzzle @-@ loading 100 @-@ pounder Somerset cannon , eight on each side on the main deck . The breech @-@ loading guns were a new design from Armstrong and much was hoped for them . <unk> tests carried out in September 1861 against an armoured target , however , proved that the 110 @-@ pounder was inferior to the 68 @-@ pounder smoothbore gun in armour penetration and repeated incidents of breech explosions during the Battles for <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> in 1863 – 64 caused the navy to withdraw the gun from service shortly afterwards . In 1865 , six 68 @-@ pounder <unk> were added , three on each side of the main deck , although she was not <unk> <unk> until her 1868 refit . 
 Detailed data for the Somerset cannon is not available , but the 7 @.@ 9 @-@ inch ( 201 mm ) solid shot of the 68 @-@ pounder gun weighed approximately 68 pounds ( 30 @.@ 8 kg ) while the gun itself weighed 10 @,@ 640 pounds ( 4 @,@ 826 @.@ 2 kg ) . The gun had a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ <unk> ft / s ( <unk> m / s ) and had a range of 3 @,@ 200 yards ( 2 @,@ 900 m ) at an elevation of 12 ° . The seven @-@ inch ( 178 mm ) shell of the 110 @-@ pounder Armstrong breech @-@ <unk> weighed 107 – 110 pounds ( 48 @.@ 5 – 49 @.@ 9 kg ) . It had a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 150 ft / s ( 350 m / s ) and , at an elevation of 11 @.@ 25 ° , a maximum range of 4 @,@ 000 yards ( 3 @,@ 700 m ) . The 110 @-@ pounder gun weighed 9 @,@ 520 pounds ( 4 @,@ <unk> @.@ 2 kg ) . All of the guns could fire both solid shot and explosive shells . 
 <unk> was <unk> during her 1867 – 68 refit with 22 seven @-@ inch and eight 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) rifled muzzle @-@ loading guns . The eight @-@ inch guns and 18 seven @-@ inch guns were mounted on the main deck and the remaining seven @-@ inch guns replaced the 110 @-@ pounders on the upper deck . The shell of the 15 @-@ calibre eight @-@ inch gun weighed 175 pounds ( 79 @.@ 4 kg ) while the gun itself weighed nine long tons ( 9 @.@ 1 t ) . It had a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 410 ft / s ( 430 m / s ) and was credited with the ability to penetrate 9 @.@ 6 inches ( <unk> mm ) of wrought iron armour at the muzzle . The 16 @-@ calibre seven @-@ inch gun weighed 6 @.@ 5 long tons ( 6 @.@ 6 t ) and fired a 112 pounds ( 50 @.@ 8 kg ) shell . It was credited with the ability to penetrate 7 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 196 mm ) armour . 
 In 1874 the ship was <unk> with 16 nine @-@ inch rifled muzzle @-@ <unk> replacing the 4 eight @-@ inch and 20 of the 22 seven @-@ inch guns . Fourteen of the nine @-@ inch ( <unk> mm ) guns were mounted on the main deck and the other two replaced the seven @-@ inch chase guns . The two remaining seven @-@ inch guns stayed in their position on the quarterdeck . As the nine @-@ inch guns were considerably bigger than their predecessors , the gun ports had to be widened to accommodate them . The shell of the 14 @-@ calibre nine @-@ inch gun weighed 254 pounds ( 115 @.@ 2 kg ) while the gun itself weighed 12 long tons ( 12 t ) . It had a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 420 ft / s ( 430 m / s ) and was rated with the ability to penetrate a 11 @.@ 3 inches ( <unk> mm ) of wrought iron armour at the muzzle . 
 The ship had a wrought iron waterline armour belt that ran the full length of the ship . <unk> , it was 4 @.@ 5 inches ( 114 mm ) thick for a length of 212 feet ( 64 @.@ 6 m ) and tapered to a thickness of 2 @.@ 5 inches ( 64 mm ) to the ends of the ship . The armour extended 5 feet 6 inches ( 1 @.@ 7 m ) below the waterline . The main deck was protected by a <unk> of armour , also 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch thick and 212 feet long . To protect against <unk> fire the upper <unk> was closed off by 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch transverse bulkheads at each end . 
 <unk> , named after the Greek mythological hero , was ordered on 10 April 1861 from the Chatham Dockyard . She was the first iron @-@ <unk> warship to be built at a royal dockyard and her construction was delayed by the need to acquire the necessary machinery to handle iron and to train the workers to use it . The ship was laid down on 1 August 1861 in a <unk> and was floated out rather than being launched on 23 December 1863 . <unk> was completed on 26 November 1864 at the cost of £ <unk> @,@ <unk> . 
 She served in the Channel Fleet until 1868 . After a refit and her first major re @-@ armament , <unk> became the <unk> at Portland until 1874 when she was again re @-@ armed . Upon its completion in 1875 , the ship became <unk> at Liverpool until 1877 when Captain William <unk> , VC , assumed command . In 1878 she was one of the ships in the <unk> Service Squadron which Admiral Geoffrey <unk> took through the Dardanelles at the time of the Russian war scare in June – August 1878 during the Russo @-@ Turkish War . <unk> accidentally collided with the flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet , Alexandra , in October 1879 , but was only lightly damaged by Alexandra 's propeller . The ship rejoined the Channel Fleet in 1880 and was paid off in 1885 . 
 She lay <unk> in the <unk> until April 1901 , when she was sent to Malta as a depot ship . To release her name for the new armoured cruiser , <unk> was renamed <unk> in 1902 . She was renamed Egmont in March 1904 , and remained in Malta until 1914 . Her role in Malta was assumed by the stone frigate Fort St Angelo . She was brought home to Chatham that year , and served there as a depot ship under the successive names of <unk> ( 19 June 1916 ) and <unk> ( 6 June 1919 ) . The ship was sold for scrap on 26 January 1923 to the <unk> <unk> Co . 
 The M3 Gun Motor Carriage ( <unk> ) was a United States Army tank destroyer equipped with one 75 mm gun and was produced by <unk> . After the fall of France , the U.S. Army decided to make a self @-@ propelled artillery piece from the <unk> gun on the M3 chassis , which was designated the <unk> . After some improvement , it came into production as the M3 Gun Motor Carriage . However , the supply of <unk> gun shields was insufficient for production needs , so a new gun shield was used . This was designated the <unk> <unk> . 
 The <unk> / M3 first served in the Philippines Campaign in 1942 with the Provisional Field Artillery Brigade in the anti @-@ tank and the fire @-@ support role . It then served in North Africa in tank destroyer battalions . It was used <unk> in the Battle of <unk> Pass and several other engagements , but was used with success in the Battle of El <unk> . It also served in the Allied invasion of Sicily , but was eventually superseded by the <unk> tank destroyer . A total of 2 @,@ 203 were produced , of which 1 @,@ 361 were converted back into <unk> half @-@ tracks . 
 The M3 <unk> also served in the Pacific theater , starting with the Battle of <unk> . It proved effective against the Japanese Type 95 Ha @-@ Go and Type 97 Chi @-@ Ha tanks . It later served in the Battle of Okinawa , the Battle of <unk> and many other island battles . 
 The M3 <unk> was 20 @.@ 46 feet ( 6 @.@ 24 m ) long , 6 @.@ 45 feet ( 1 @.@ 97 m ) wide , 8 @.@ 17 feet ( 2 @.@ 49 m ) high ( including the gun shield ) , and weighed 20 @,@ 000 pounds ( 9 @.@ 1 t ) . Its suspension consisted of semi @-@ elliptical <unk> leaf springs for the wheels and vertical <unk> springs for the tracks , while its transmission consisted of constant <unk> . Its ground clearance was 11 @.@ 2 inches ( 280 mm ) . 
 It had a White <unk> 147 horsepower ( 110 kW ) , 386 cubic inch ( 6 @,@ 330 <unk> ) , 6 @-@ cylinder engine with a compression ratio of 6 @.@ 44 : 1 . It had a 150 mile ( 240 km ) range , 60 US gal ( 230 l ) fuel tank , a speed of 47 mph ( 75 km / h ) , and a power to weight ratio of 14 @.@ 7 hp per ton . It was armed with one 75 mm <unk> with 59 rounds , had 0 @.@ 25 – 0 @.@ 625 in ( 6 @.@ 4 – 15 @.@ 9 mm ) of armor , and a crew of five consisting of a commander , gunner , two <unk> , and a driver . The M3 ( with the <unk> mount ) could traverse 19 ° left and 21 ° right , elevate 29 ° and depress − 10 ° . The <unk> ( using the <unk> mount ) could traverse 21 ° in both directions , but could only depress − 6 @.@ 5 ° . 
 After the fall of France , the U.S. Army studied the reasons behind the effectiveness of the German campaign against the French and British forces . One aspect that was highlighted by this study was the use of self propelled artillery ; however , by 1941 , there was little available in the U.S. Army 's arsenal that could be used in such a role . The Army had a number of <unk> guns , sufficient enough for the mass @-@ production for such a weapon , and the M3 half @-@ track was coming into production . After some debate , the Army decided to place <unk> guns on the M3 half @-@ track chassis , which was designated the <unk> <unk> . The <unk> gun was originally adapted for the M3 chassis by placing it in a <unk> box riveted to the chassis behind the driver 's compartment . It was accepted by the Army on 31 October 1941 . 
 A batch of 36 <unk> were used for testing , while another 50 were built and transported to the Philippines . The 36 <unk> were improved in multiple ways . The improvements included the inclusion of a mount that raised the gun shield , the replacement of the original gun shield with the <unk> gun shield , and the addition of a 0 @.@ 5 in ( 12 @.@ 7 mm ) <unk> <unk> machine gun , which was later removed . After the final improvements were finished , the prototype vehicles were sent to the <unk> Company for production . 
 As the existing supply of <unk> gun shields was insufficient to meet requirements for the production of the M3 , the Ordnance Department developed the <unk> gun shield , which replaced the <unk> . The new design was designated as the <unk> Gun Motor Carriage . 
 The <unk> / M3 <unk> first saw action with the U.S. Army in the Philippines in 1941 – 42 , six months after it was designed . Three battalions of the Provisional Field Artillery Brigade operated <unk> against the Japanese when they invaded the Philippines . During the early part of the campaign , the vehicle was used to provide direct covering fire and anti @-@ tank support . The Japanese captured a few vehicles in 1942 and used them in the defense of the Philippines . 
 The M3 also served with the U.S. Marines in the Pacific Theater of Operations and was first used in the invasion of <unk> . It proved highly effective against the Type 95 Ha @-@ Go and the Type 97 Chi @-@ Ha , in the fight against the Japanese 9th Tank Regiment on <unk> . It also served in the Battle of <unk> and the Battle of Okinawa , and many other conflicts in the Pacific . 
 The M3 <unk> saw limited service with other countries as it was not widely supplied through the <unk> @-@ <unk> program . A small batch of 170 vehicles were supplied to Britain , which used them in armored car regiments . They were first used in the <unk> Campaign with the Royal <unk> . They were also used in Sicily , Italy , and later in France , but were gradually retired . The Free French Army also used <unk> for training before receiving <unk> tank destroyers . 
 A total of 2 @,@ 202 M3 <unk> were produced from 1941 to 1943 . Only 86 vehicles were produced in 1941 , but this was increased in 1942 during which 1 @,@ 350 examples came off the production lines . A further <unk> were completed in 1943 . Production was stopped due to the release of better tank destroyers , like the <unk> <unk> . 
 <unk> son of <unk> ( Pictish : * <unk> map <unk> ; Old Irish : <unk> mac <unk> , " Angus mac <unk> " ) , was king of the <unk> from <unk> until his death in 761 . His reign can be reconstructed in some detail from a variety of sources . 
 <unk> became the chief king in <unk> following a period of civil war in the late <unk> . During his reign , the neighbouring kingdom of Dál Riata was <unk> and the kingdom of <unk> was attacked with less success . The most powerful ruler in Scotland for over two decades , he was involved in wars in Ireland and England . Kings from <unk> 's family dominated <unk> until <unk> when a disastrous defeat at the hands of Vikings began a new period of instability , which ended with the coming to power of <unk> mac <unk> . 
 In <unk> , <unk> is found campaigning alongside <unk> of Northumbria . The campaign is reported as follows : 
 In the year of the Lord 's incarnation <unk> , king <unk> in the eighteenth year of his reign , and <unk> , king of <unk> led armies to the town of <unk> . And hence the Britons accepted terms there , on the first day of the month of August . But on the tenth day of the same month perished almost the whole army which he led from <unk> to <unk> . 
 <unk> died in 761 , " aged probably more than seventy , ... the dominating figure in the politics of Northern Britain " . His death is reported in the usual brief style by the <unk> , except for the <unk> of Bede in Northumbria , possibly relying upon a Dál Riata source , who wrote : 
 <unk> , king of the <unk> , died . From the beginning of his reign right to the end he <unk> bloody crimes , like a <unk> <unk> . 
 The Pictish Chronicle king lists have it that he was succeeded by his brother <unk> . His son <unk> was later king , and is the first son of a Pictish king known to have become king . 
 The following 9th @-@ century Irish praise poem from the Book of Leinster is associated with <unk> : 
 The amount of information which has survived about <unk> compared with other Pictish kings , the nature and geographical range of his activities and the length of his reign combine to make King <unk> one of the most significant rulers of the insular Dark Ages .
