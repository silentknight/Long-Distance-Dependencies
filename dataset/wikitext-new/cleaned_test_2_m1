 Du Fu ( Wade – Giles : Tu Fu ; Chinese : <unk> ; <unk> – 770 ) was a prominent Chinese poet of the Tang dynasty . Along with Li <unk> ( Li Po ) , he is frequently called the greatest of the Chinese poets . His greatest ambition was to serve his country as a successful civil servant , but he proved unable to make the necessary accommodations . His life , like the whole country , was devastated by the An <unk> Rebellion of <unk> , and his last 15 years were a time of almost constant unrest . 
 Although initially he was little @-@ known to other writers , his works came to be hugely influential in both Chinese and Japanese literary culture . Of his poetic writing , nearly fifteen hundred poems have been preserved over the ages . He has been called the " Poet @-@ Historian " and the " Poet @-@ Sage " by Chinese critics , while the range of his work has allowed him to be introduced to Western readers as " the Chinese Virgil , Horace , <unk> , Shakespeare , Milton , Burns , <unk> , <unk> , Hugo or <unk> " . 
 Traditional Chinese literary criticism emphasized the life of the author when interpreting a work , a practice which Burton Watson attributes to " the close links that traditional Chinese thought posits between art and morality " . Since many of Du Fu 's poems feature morality and history , this practice is particularly important . Another reason , identified by the Chinese historian William <unk> , is that Chinese poems are typically <unk> , <unk> context that might be relevant , but which an informed contemporary could be assumed to know . For modern Western readers , " The less accurately we know the time , the place and the circumstances in the background , the more liable we are to imagine it incorrectly , and the result will be that we either <unk> the poem or fail to understand it altogether " . Stephen Owen suggests a third factor particular to Du Fu , arguing that the variety of the poet 's work required consideration of his whole life , rather than the " <unk> " <unk> used for more limited poets . 
 Most of what is known of Du Fu 's life comes from his poems . His paternal grandfather was Du <unk> , a noted politician and poet during the reign of Empress Wu . Du Fu was born in <unk> ; the exact birthplace is unknown , except that it was near Luoyang , Henan province ( Gong county is a favourite candidate ) . In later life , he considered himself to belong to the capital city of Chang 'an , ancestral hometown of the Du family . 
 Du Fu 's mother died shortly after he was born , and he was partially raised by his aunt . He had an elder brother , who died young . He also had three half brothers and one half sister , to whom he frequently refers in his poems , although he never mentions his stepmother . 
 The son of a minor scholar @-@ official , his youth was spent on the standard education of a future civil servant : study and <unk> of the Confucian classics of philosophy , history and poetry . He later claimed to have produced <unk> poems by his early teens , but these have been lost . 
 In the early <unk> , he travelled in the <unk> / Zhejiang area ; his earliest surviving poem , describing a poetry contest , is thought to date from the end of this period , around 735 . In that year , he took the civil service exam , likely in Chang 'an . He failed , to his surprise and that of centuries of later critics . <unk> concludes that he probably failed because his prose style at the time was too dense and obscure , while Chou suggests his failure to <unk> connections in the capital may have been to blame . After this failure , he went back to traveling , this time around Shandong and Hebei . 
 His father died around 740 . Du Fu would have been allowed to enter the civil service because of his father 's rank , but he is thought to have given up the privilege in favour of one of his half brothers . He spent the next four years living in the Luoyang area , fulfilling his duties in domestic affairs . 
 In the autumn of <unk> , he met Li <unk> ( Li Po ) for the first time , and the two poets formed a friendship . David Young describes this as " the most significant formative element in Du Fu 's artistic development " because it gave him a living example of the reclusive poet @-@ scholar life to which he was attracted after his failure in the civil service exam . The relationship was somewhat one @-@ sided , however . Du Fu was by some years the younger , while Li <unk> was already a poetic star . We have twelve poems to or about Li <unk> from the younger poet , but only one in the other direction . They met again only once , in <unk> . 
 In 746 , he moved to the capital in an attempt to resurrect his official career . He took the civil service exam a second time during the following year , but all the candidates were failed by the prime minister ( apparently in order to prevent the emergence of possible rivals ) . He never again attempted the examinations , instead <unk> the emperor directly in <unk> , 754 and probably again in <unk> . He married around <unk> , and by <unk> the couple had had five children — three sons and two daughters — but one of the sons died in infancy in <unk> . From 754 he began to have lung problems ( probably asthma ) , the first of a series of <unk> which <unk> him for the rest of his life . It was in that year that Du Fu was forced to move his family due to the turmoil of a famine brought about by massive floods in the region . 
 In <unk> , he received an appointment as <unk> of the Right Commandant 's office of the Crown Prince 's Palace . Although this was a minor post , in normal times it would have been at least the start of an official career . Even before he had begun work , however , the position was swept away by events . 
 The An <unk> Rebellion began in December <unk> , and was not completely suppressed for almost eight years . It caused enormous disruption to Chinese society : the census of 754 recorded 52 @.@ 9 million people , but ten years later , the census counted just 16 @.@ 9 million , the remainder having been displaced or killed . During this time , Du Fu led a largely itinerant life <unk> by wars , associated <unk> and imperial <unk> . This period of <unk> was the making of Du Fu as a poet : Even Shan Chou has written that , " What he saw around him — the lives of his family , neighbors , and strangers – what he heard , and what he hoped for or feared from the progress of various campaigns — these became the enduring themes of his poetry " . Even when he learned of the death of his youngest child , he turned to the suffering of others in his poetry instead of dwelling upon his own <unk> . Du Fu wrote : 
 <unk> on what I have lived through , if even I know such suffering , the common man must surely be <unk> by the winds . 
 In <unk> , Emperor <unk> was forced to flee the capital and <unk> . Du Fu , who had been away from the city , took his family to a place of safety and attempted to join the court of the new emperor ( <unk> ) , but he was captured by the rebels and taken to Chang 'an . In the autumn , his youngest son , Du <unk> ( Baby Bear ) , was born . Around this time Du Fu is thought to have contracted malaria . 
 He escaped from Chang 'an the following year , and was appointed <unk> when he rejoined the court in May <unk> . This post gave access to the emperor but was largely ceremonial . Du Fu 's <unk> compelled him to try to make use of it : he caused trouble for himself by protesting the removal of his friend and patron Fang Guan on a petty charge . He was arrested but was <unk> in June . He was granted leave to visit his family in September , but he soon rejoined the court and on December 8 , <unk> , he returned to Chang 'an with the emperor following its recapture by government forces . However , his advice continued to be <unk> , and in the summer of <unk> he was demoted to a post as Commissioner of Education in <unk> . The position was not to his taste : in one poem , he wrote : 
 I am about to scream <unk> in the office / Especially when they bring more papers to pile higher on my desk . 
 He moved on in the summer of <unk> ; this has traditionally been ascribed to famine , but <unk> believes that frustration is a more likely reason . He next spent around six weeks in <unk> ( now <unk> , Gansu province ) , where he wrote more than sixty poems . 
 Luoyang , the region of his birthplace , was recovered by government forces in the winter of 762 , and in the spring of <unk> Du Fu and his family sailed down the Yangtze , apparently with the intention of making their way there . They traveled slowly , held up by his ill @-@ health ( by this time he was suffering from poor eyesight , <unk> and general old age in addition to his previous <unk> ) . They stayed in <unk> ( in what is now <unk> , <unk> ) at the entrance to the Three <unk> for almost two years from late spring <unk> . This period was Du Fu 's last great poetic flowering , and here he wrote 400 poems in his dense , late style . In autumn <unk> , Bo <unk> became governor of the region : he supported Du Fu financially and employed him as his unofficial secretary . 
 In March <unk> , he began his journey again and got as far as <unk> province , where he died in <unk> ( now <unk> ) in November or December 770 , in his <unk> year . He was survived by his wife and two sons , who remained in the area for some years at least . His last known descendant is a grandson who requested a grave inscription for the poet from Yuan <unk> in <unk> . 
 <unk> <unk> his life by concluding that , " He appeared to be a <unk> son , an affectionate father , a generous brother , a faithful husband , a loyal friend , a <unk> official , and a patriotic subject . " 
 Below is an example of one of Du Fu 's later works , To My <unk> Friend <unk> ( Chinese : <unk> ) . Like many other poems in the Tang it featured the theme of a long parting between friends , which was often due to officials being frequently transferred to the provinces : 
 Criticism of Du Fu 's works has focused on his strong sense of history , his moral engagement , and his technical excellence . 
 Since the Song dynasty , critics have called Du Fu the " poet historian " ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) . The most directly historical of his poems are those commenting on military tactics or the successes and failures of the government , or the poems of advice which he wrote to the emperor . <unk> , he wrote about the effect of the times in which he lived on himself , and on the ordinary people of China . As Watson notes , this is information " of a kind seldom found in the officially compiled histories of the era " . 
 Du Fu 's political comments are based on emotion rather than calculation : his <unk> have been <unk> as , " Let us all be less selfish , let us all do what we are supposed to do " . Since his views were impossible to disagree with , his <unk> expressed <unk> enabled his installation as the central figure of Chinese poetic history . 
 A second favourite epithet of Chinese critics is that of " poet sage " ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , a counterpart to the philosophical sage , <unk> . One of the earliest surviving works , The Song of the <unk> ( from around 750 ) , gives voice to the <unk> of a <unk> soldier in the imperial army and a clear @-@ sighted consciousness of suffering . These concerns are continuously articulated in poems on the lives of both soldiers and civilians produced by Du Fu throughout his life . 
 Although Du Fu 's frequent references to his own difficulties can give the impression of an all @-@ consuming <unk> , Hawkes argues that his " famous compassion in fact includes himself , viewed quite <unk> and almost as an <unk> " . He therefore " lends grandeur " to the wider picture by comparing it to " his own slightly comical triviality " . 
 Du Fu 's compassion , for himself and for others , was part of his general broadening of the scope of poetry : he devoted many works to topics which had previously been considered unsuitable for poetic treatment . Zhang Jie wrote that for Du Fu , " everything in this world is poetry " , Du wrote extensively on subjects such as domestic life , calligraphy , paintings , animals , and other poems . 
 The tenor of his work changed as he developed his style and adapted to his surroundings ( " <unk> @-@ like " according to Watson ) : his earliest works are in a relatively derivative , courtly style , but he came into his own in the years of the rebellion . Owen comments on the " <unk> simplicity " of the <unk> poems , which mirrors the desert landscape ; the works from his <unk> period are " light , often finely observed " ; while the poems from the late <unk> period have a " density and power of vision " . 
 Although he wrote in all poetic forms , Du Fu is best known for his <unk> , a type of poem with strict constraints on form and content , for example : 
 About two thirds of Du Fu 's 1500 extant works are in this form , and he is generally considered to be its leading exponent . His best <unk> use the <unk> required by the form to add expressive content rather than as mere technical restrictions . Hawkes comments that , " it is amazing that Tu Fu is able to use so immensely stylized a form in so natural a manner " . 
 According to the <unk> Britannica , Du Fu 's writings are considered by many literary critics to be among the greatest of all time , and it states " his dense , compressed language makes use of all the <unk> overtones of a phrase and of all the <unk> <unk> of the individual word , qualities that no translation can ever reveal . " 
 In his lifetime and immediately following his death , Du Fu was not greatly appreciated . In part this can be attributed to his stylistic and formal innovations , some of which are still " considered extremely daring and bizarre by Chinese critics . " There are few contemporary references to him — only eleven poems from six writers — and these describe him in terms of affection , but not as a <unk> of poetic or moral ideals . Du Fu is also poorly represented in contemporary anthologies of poetry . 
 However , as <unk> notes , he " is the only Chinese poet whose influence grew with time " , and his works began to increase in popularity in the ninth century . Early positive comments came from <unk> <unk> , who praised the moral sentiments of some of Du Fu 's works ( although he found these in only a small fraction of the poems ) , and from Han Yu , who wrote a piece defending Du Fu and Li <unk> on aesthetic grounds from attacks made against them . Both these writers showed the influence of Du Fu in their own poetic work . By the beginning of the 10th century , <unk> <unk> constructed the first replica of his <unk> cottage in Sichuan . 
 It was in the 11th century , during the Northern Song era that Du Fu 's reputation reached its peak . In this period a comprehensive re @-@ evaluation of earlier poets took place , in which Wang <unk> , Li <unk> and Du Fu came to be regarded as representing respectively the Buddhist , <unk> and Confucian strands of Chinese culture . At the same time , the development of Neo @-@ <unk> ensured that Du Fu , as its poetic <unk> , occupied the paramount position . Su Shi famously expressed this reasoning when he wrote that Du Fu was " <unk> ... because ... through all his <unk> , he never for the space of a meal <unk> his sovereign " . His influence was helped by his ability to reconcile apparent opposites : political <unk> were attracted by his loyalty to the established order , while political radicals embraced his concern for the poor . Literary <unk> could look to his technical mastery , while literary radicals were inspired by his innovations . Since the establishment of the People 's Republic of China , Du Fu 's loyalty to the state and concern for the poor have been interpreted as embryonic nationalism and socialism , and he has been praised for his use of simple , " people 's language " . 
 Du Fu 's popularity grew to such an extent that it is as hard to measure his influence as that of Shakespeare in England : it was hard for any Chinese poet not to be influenced by him . While there was never another Du Fu , individual poets followed in the traditions of specific aspects of his work : <unk> <unk> 's concern for the poor , Lu You 's patriotism , and <unk> <unk> 's <unk> on the <unk> are a few examples . More broadly , Du Fu 's work in transforming the <unk> from mere word play into " a vehicle for serious poetic <unk> " set the stage for every subsequent writer in the genre . 
 In the 20th century , he was the favourite poet of Kenneth <unk> , who has described him as " the greatest non @-@ epic , non @-@ dramatic poet who has survived in any language " , and commented that , " he has made me a better man , as a moral agent and as a <unk> organism " . 
 Du Fu 's poetry has made a profound impact on Japanese literature , especially on the literature from the <unk> period and on scholars and poets in the Edo period , including <unk> <unk> , the very greatest of all <unk> poets . Even in modern Japanese , the term Saint of Poetry ( <unk> , <unk> ) is mostly synonymous with Du Fu . 
 Other translators have placed much greater weight on trying to convey a sense of the poetic forms used by Du Fu . Vikram Seth in Three Chinese Poets uses English @-@ style rhyme schemes , whereas Keith <unk> in Facing the Moon <unk> the Chinese rhyme scheme ; both use end @-@ stopped lines and preserve some degree of <unk> . In The Selected Poems of Du Fu , Burton Watson follows the <unk> quite strictly , persuading the western reader to adapt to the poems rather than vice versa . Similarly , he deals with the allusion of the later works by combining literal translation with extensive <unk> . 
 In 2015 , Stephen Owen published translations , with facing Chinese texts , of the complete poetry of Du Fu in six volumes , with extensive scholarly apparatus , which emphasized <unk> .

 The <unk> @-@ class battleships ( <unk> , <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> ) were a pair of dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Japanese Navy ( <unk> ) during World War I. Originally intended to be repeats of the preceding <unk> class , they were redesigned before construction began . Both ships carried supplies for the survivors of the Great <unk> earthquake in 1923 . They were modernized in 1934 – 37 with improvements to their armour and machinery and a rebuilt superstructure in the pagoda mast style . Afterwards they played a minor role in the Second <unk> @-@ Japanese War . 
 Despite the expensive reconstructions , both vessels were considered obsolete by the eve of the Pacific War , and neither saw significant action in the early years of the war . Following the loss of most of the <unk> 's large aircraft carriers during the Battle of Midway in mid @-@ 1942 , they were rebuilt with a flight deck replacing the rear pair of gun turrets to give them the ability to operate an air group of <unk> . A lack of aircraft and qualified pilots , however , meant that they never actually operated their aircraft in combat . While awaiting their air group the sister ships were sometimes used to ferry troops and material to Japanese bases . They participated in the Battle of Cape <unk> in late 1944 , where they <unk> the American carrier fleet supporting the invasion of <unk> away from the landing beaches . Afterwards both ships were transferred to Southeast Asia ; in early 1945 they participated in Operation <unk> , where they transported petrol and other strategic materials to Japan . The sisters were then reduced to reserve until they were sunk during American airstrikes in July . After the war they were scrapped in 1946 – 47 . 
 The design of the <unk> @-@ class battleships was shaped both by the ongoing international naval arms race and a desire among Japanese naval planners to maintain a fleet of capital ships powerful enough to defeat the United States Navy in an encounter in Japanese territorial waters . The <unk> 's fleet of battleships had proven highly successful in 1905 , the last year of the Russo @-@ Japanese War , which culminated in the destruction of the Russian Second and Third Pacific Squadrons at the Battle of <unk> . 
 In the aftermath , the Japanese Empire immediately turned its focus to the two remaining rivals for imperial dominance in the Pacific Ocean : Britain and the United States . <unk> <unk> , a Japanese Navy admiral and military theorist , speculated that conflict would inevitably arise between Japan and at least one of its two main rivals . To that end , he called for the Japanese Navy to maintain a fleet with at least 70 % as many capital ships as the US Navy . This ratio , <unk> theorized , would enable the Imperial Japanese Navy to defeat the US Navy in one major battle in Japanese waters in any eventual conflict . Accordingly , the 1907 Imperial Defence Policy called for the construction of a battle fleet of eight modern battleships , 20 @,@ 000 long tons ( 20 @,@ 321 t ) each , and eight modern armoured cruisers , 18 @,@ 000 long tons ( 18 @,@ <unk> t ) each . This was the genesis of the Eight @-@ Eight Fleet Program , the development of a cohesive battle line of sixteen capital ships . 
 The launch of HMS <unk> in 1906 by the Royal Navy raised the stakes , and complicated Japan 's plans . <unk> 17 @,@ 900 long tons ( 18 @,@ 200 t ) and armed with ten 12 @-@ inch ( 30 @.@ 5 cm ) guns , <unk> rendered all existing battleships obsolete by comparison . The launch of the battlecruiser HMS Invincible the following year was a further setback for Japan 's quest for parity . When the two new <unk> @-@ class battleships and two <unk> @-@ class armoured cruisers , launched by 1911 , were <unk> by their British counterparts , the Eight @-@ Eight Fleet Program was <unk> . 
 The first battleships built for the renewed Eight @-@ Eight Fleet Program were the two dreadnoughts of the <unk> class , ordered in 1907 and laid down in 1908 . In 1910 , the Navy put forward a request to the Diet ( parliament ) to secure funding for the entirety of the program at once . Because of economic constraints , only four battlecruisers and a single battleship of the <unk> class were ultimately approved by the Diet . Three more <unk> @-@ class ships ( <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ) were approved and all three were ordered in April 1913 . While <unk> was laid down later that year , the <unk> lacked the funding to proceed with the construction of <unk> and <unk> until the Diet authorized additional funding for the ships in July 1914 . 
 The ships had a length of 208 @.@ 18 metres ( <unk> ft 0 in ) overall , a beam of 28 @.@ 65 metres ( 94 ft 0 in ) and a draught of 8 @.@ 93 metres ( 29 ft 4 in ) at deep load . They displaced 36 @,@ 500 long tons ( 37 @,@ 100 t ) at deep load , roughly 650 long tons ( 660 t ) more than the preceding class . Their crew consisted of 1 @,@ 360 officers and enlisted men . They had a <unk> height of 1 @.@ 737 metres ( 5 ft 8 @.@ 4 in ) at deep load . 
 During the ships ' modernization during the 1930s , their forward <unk> were enlarged with multiple platforms added to their tripod <unk> . Both ships were also given torpedo <unk> to improve their underwater protection and to compensate for the weight of the additional armour . In addition , their <unk> were lengthened by 7 @.@ 62 metres ( 25 @.@ 0 ft ) . These changes increased their overall length to 213 @.@ 8 metres ( 701 ft ) , their beam to 31 @.@ 75 metres ( 104 ft 2 in ) and their draft to 9 @.@ 45 metres ( 31 ft 0 in ) . Their displacement increased over 5 @,@ 000 long tons ( 5 @,@ 100 t ) to 42 @,@ 001 long tons ( 42 @,@ <unk> t ) at deep load . The crew now numbered 1 @,@ <unk> officers and enlisted men . 
 During their 1930s modernization , the boilers on each ship were replaced by eight new <unk> oil @-@ fired boilers , fitted into the former aft boiler room , and the forward funnel was removed . The turbines were replaced by four geared <unk> turbines with a designed output of 80 @,@ 000 shp ( 60 @,@ 000 kW ) intended to increase their speed to 24 @.@ 5 knots ( 45 @.@ 4 km / h ; 28 @.@ 2 mph ) . On her trials , <unk> reached a top speed of 25 @.@ 26 knots ( 46 @.@ 78 km / h ; 29 @.@ 07 mph ) from 81 @,@ 050 shp ( 60 @,@ 440 kW ) . The fuel storage of the ships was increased to a total of 5 @,@ 113 long tons ( 5 @,@ 195 t ) of fuel oil that gave them a range of 7 @,@ <unk> nautical miles ( 14 @,@ 580 km ; 9 @,@ 060 mi ) at a speed of 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) . 
 The twelve 45 @-@ calibre 35 @.@ 6 cm ( 14 @.@ 0 in ) Type 41 guns of the <unk> class were mounted in three pairs of twin @-@ gun , superfiring turrets . <unk> one through six from front to rear , each turret weighed <unk> long tons ( <unk> t ) . The <unk> powered turrets had an elevation capability of − 5 / + 20 degrees . The guns had a rate of fire of 1 @.@ 5 – 2 rounds per minute and could be loaded at any angle between <unk> and + 20 degrees . In 1921 the elevation was increased to + 30 degrees and then to + 43 degrees during their mid @-@ 1930s modernization , except for No. 6 turret as its supporting structure could not be lowered . The <unk> mechanism of the guns was also changed from a hydraulic to a <unk> system , which allowed for a faster firing cycle of the main guns . 
 By World War II , the guns used Type 91 armour @-@ piercing , capped shells . Each of these shells weighed <unk> @.@ 5 kilograms ( 1 @,@ <unk> lb ) and was fired at a muzzle velocity of 770 – 775 metres per second ( 2 @,@ <unk> – 2 @,@ 540 ft / s ) . They had a maximum range of 25 @,@ 000 metres ( 27 @,@ 000 yd ) at + 20 degrees of elevation and 35 @,@ 450 meters ( 38 @,@ 770 yd ) at + 43 degrees after modernization . Also available was a 625 @-@ kilogram ( 1 @,@ <unk> lb ) high @-@ explosive shell that had a muzzle velocity of 805 metres per second ( 2 @,@ 640 ft / s ) . A special Type 3 <unk> incendiary shrapnel shell was developed in the 1930s for anti @-@ aircraft use . 
 The ships ' secondary armament consisted of twenty 50 @-@ calibre 14 @-@ <unk> Type 3 . Eighteen of these were mounted in casemates in the forecastle and superstructure and the remaining pair were mounted on the deck above them and protected by gun shields . They had a maximum elevation of + 20 degrees which gave them ranges of 16 @,@ 300 metres ( 17 @,@ 800 yd ) . Each gun had a rate of fire of up to 10 rounds per minute . Anti @-@ aircraft defence was provided by four 40 @-@ calibre 3rd Year Type 8 @-@ <unk> AA guns in single mounts . The 7 @.@ 62 @-@ <unk> ( 3 in ) high @-@ angle guns had a maximum elevation of + 75 degrees , and had a rate of fire of 13 to 20 rounds per minute . They fired a 6 kg ( 13 lb ) <unk> with a muzzle velocity of 680 m / s ( 2 @,@ 200 ft / s ) to a maximum height of 7 @,@ 500 metres ( 24 @,@ 600 ft ) . The ships were also fitted with six submerged 53 @.@ 3 @-@ <unk> ( 21 @.@ 0 in ) torpedo tubes , three on each broadside . They carried twelve to eighteen 6th Year Type torpedoes which had a 200 @-@ kilogram ( 440 lb ) warhead . They had three settings for range and speed : 15 @,@ 000 metres ( 16 @,@ 000 yd ) at 26 knots ( 48 km / h ; 30 mph ) , 10 @,@ 000 metres ( 11 @,@ 000 yd ) at 32 knots ( 59 km / h ; 37 mph ) , or 7 @,@ 000 metres ( 7 @,@ 700 yd ) at 37 knots ( 69 km / h ; 43 mph ) . 
 In 1931 – 33 the AA guns were replaced with eight 40 @-@ caliber 12 @.@ 7 cm ( 5 @.@ 0 in ) Type 89 dual @-@ purpose guns , fitted on both sides of the forward <unk> in four twin @-@ gun mounts . When firing at surface targets , the guns had a range of 14 @,@ 700 metres ( 16 @,@ 100 yd ) ; they had a ceiling of 9 @,@ 440 metres ( 30 @,@ 970 ft ) at their maximum elevation of + 90 degrees . Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute , but their sustained rate of fire was around eight rounds per minute . Two twin @-@ gun mounts for license @-@ built Vickers two @-@ pounder light AA guns were also added . These guns had a maximum elevation of + 80 degrees and a rate of fire of 200 rounds per minute . The pair of 14 cm guns on the upper deck were removed at this time . 
 During the mid @-@ 1930s reconstruction the torpedo tubes were removed and the Vickers two @-@ pounders were replaced by twenty license @-@ built <unk> 25 mm Type 96 light AA guns in 10 twin @-@ gun mounts . This was the standard Japanese light AA gun during World War II , but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon . According to historian Mark <unk> , the twin and triple mounts " lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation ; the gun sights were unable to handle fast targets ; the gun exhibited excessive vibration ; the magazine was too small , and , finally , the gun produced excessive muzzle blast " . These 25 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) guns had an effective range of 1 @,@ 500 – 3 @,@ 000 metres ( 1 @,@ 600 – 3 @,@ 300 yd ) , and an effective ceiling of 5 @,@ 500 metres ( 18 @,@ 000 ft ) at an elevation of 85 degrees . The maximum effective rate of fire was only between 110 and 120 rounds per minute because of the frequent need to change the fifteen @-@ round magazines . In addition the forward pair of 14 cm guns in the forecastle were removed at this time and the maximum elevation of the remaining guns was increased to + 30 degrees . 
 The <unk> @-@ class ships ' waterline protective belt had a maximum thickness of <unk> mm ( 11 @.@ 8 in ) of Vickers cemented armour amidships ; below it was a <unk> of 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) armour . The upper armoured deck consisted of two layers of high @-@ tensile steel 55 mm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) thick and the lower armoured deck also consisted of two layers of high @-@ tensile steel , but only 30 mm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) thick . The sides of this deck sloped downwards to meet the bottom of the lower <unk> of the belt armour . The ends of the belt armour were closed off by bulkheads that ranged in thickness from 203 to 102 mm ( 8 to 4 in ) . The turrets were protected with an armour thickness of 254 mm ( 10 in ) on the face and 76 mm on the roof . The casemate armour was 149 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) thick and that of the barbettes was <unk> mm thick rather than the originally planned 305 mm . The sides of the conning tower were 305 mm thick . 
 The <unk> class were the only Japanese battleships to place the powder magazine above the shell magazine as the <unk> wished to put as much space as possible between the highly flammable propellant and mine and torpedo <unk> . The danger from <unk> shells at long distances was not appreciated until the fatal magazine explosions of three British battlecruisers during the 1916 Battle of Jutland <unk> demonstrated the point . To further protect the magazines the depth of the double bottom was increased to a total of 3 @.@ 58 metres ( 11 ft 9 in ) underneath the barbettes and magazines . Additionally , the vessels contained 660 <unk> compartments to preserve <unk> in the event of battle damage . In addition to the torpedo <unk> added when the ships were modernized , the deck armour over the machinery and magazines was increased to a total thickness of 140 mm . Inside the original skin of the ships , two torpedo bulkheads were also added and the turret roofs were increased to a total of 152 millimetres ( 6 in ) of armour . 
 While the details of the ship 's fire @-@ control instruments are not fully available , it is known that the ships were fitted with a fire @-@ control director after completion . No computer was fitted at that time and data from the rangefinders had to be processed manually . <unk> 2 , 3 , and 5 were built with imported 6 @-@ metre ( 19 ft 8 in ) <unk> & <unk> rangefinders . These were felt to be inferior to the British <unk> & Stroud instruments used on other ships and were removed in 1920 . They were replaced by either the British rangefinders or domestically built instruments of 6 or 8 metres ( 19 ft 8 in or 26 ft 3 in ) length . In the late 1920s the fire @-@ control systems were upgraded and additional platforms were added to the foremast to accommodate them . A pair of directors for the 12 @.@ 7 cm AA guns were added , one on each side of the forward superstructure , in the early 1930s . The fire @-@ control systems were again upgraded in the mid @-@ 1930s and directors were added for the 25 mm AA guns . Both ships had 10 @-@ metre ( 32 ft 10 in ) rangefinders installed at the top of the pagoda mast at that time . Type 21 air @-@ search <unk> were installed aboard the sisters in mid @-@ 1942 . 
 The rear turrets , the barbettes and their supporting structures were removed beginning in early 1943 and the openings in the middle deck were covered by 152 mm plates salvaged from the turret armour . All of the 14 cm guns were removed and the casemate openings sealed off . Four additional twin 12 @.@ 7 cm mounts were added , one pair abreast the funnel and the other abreast the conning tower . The original ten twin 25 mm gun mounts were replaced by triple mounts and nine new triple mounts were added , a total of 57 guns . Two each Type 94 and Type 95 AA directors were added to control the additional guns . The ammunition for these new guns was stored in the magazines originally used for the 14 cm guns and for <unk> No. 5 . During 1944 , the ships ' AA defences were reinforced with an additional dozen triple and eleven single 25 mm gun mounts , for a total of 104 barrels , and a pair of Type 13 early warning <unk> were added . In September six 30 @-@ round AA rocket launchers were added on the sides of the flight deck . 
 A 70 @-@ metre @-@ long ( <unk> ft 8 in ) flight deck was built above the stern and stretched forward to the rebuilt aft superstructure . The flight deck was 29 metres ( 95 ft 2 in ) wide at its forward end and 13 metres ( 42 ft 8 in ) at the stern . It <unk> the stern and increased the overall length of the ships to 219 @.@ 62 metres ( 720 ft 6 in ) . A pair of rotating gunpowder @-@ propelled <unk> were fitted on the sides of the hull , forward of the aft superstructure where they partially restricted the arc of fire of the two amidships turrets . They could launch aircraft up to 4 @,@ 600 kilograms ( 10 @,@ 100 lb ) in weight and required 30 seconds to launch each aircraft . The flight deck had eight permanent storage positions connected by rails to the <unk> and the <unk> operated aircraft lift that brought the aircraft up from the hangar below on the trolleys used to move the <unk> about . Two aircraft were intended to be <unk> on the <unk> and three more in temporary positions on the flight deck for a total of thirteen . 
 The 40 @-@ metre @-@ long ( 131 ft 3 in ) hangar was 20 metres ( 65 ft 7 in ) wide forward and 11 metres ( 36 ft 1 in ) at the rear . It was 6 metres ( 19 ft 8 in ) high and designed to <unk> nine aircraft . It was fitted with fire fighting <unk> and carbon dioxide <unk> as a result of wartime experience . The ' T ' <unk> lift was 12 @.@ 1 metres ( 39 ft 8 in ) wide at its forward end and 6 @.@ 6 metres ( 21 ft 8 in ) wide at the its aft end . It was 12 @.@ 1 metres long and had a capacity of 6 tonnes ( 5 @.@ 9 long tons ) . <unk> storage tanks with a capacity of 76 tonnes ( 75 long tons ) were installed in the former magazine of <unk> No. 6 to provide each aircraft with enough fuel for three sorties . To recover the aircraft the <unk> crane formerly on the stern was moved up to the port side of the flight deck . Another crane was intended on the starboard side , but it was never fitted . 
 The ships had an air group of 11 each of <unk> <unk> dive bombers ( Allied reporting name " Judy " ) and <unk> <unk> reconnaissance aircraft ( Allied reporting name " Paul " ) Both aircraft had development problems and neither air group ever had all of its intended aircraft . Coupled with a shortage of trained pilots , neither ship ever used its aircraft during combat . 
 After the loss of the fast battleship <unk> at the Naval Battle of <unk> in late 1942 to rudder damage , the <unk> decided to reinforce the protection of the steering compartment and to create an auxiliary steering compartment . The protection of the former was strengthened by the addition of a concrete wall at least 1 metre ( 3 ft 3 in ) in thickness and some of the armour removed from the turrets was used to protect the latter . The double bottom below the former positions of aft turrets was converted to hold fuel oil ; this increased the ships ' endurance to 9 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 17 @,@ 600 km ; 10 @,@ 900 mi ) at a speed of 16 knots . A pair of Type 22 surface @-@ search <unk> were also fitted during the conversion . 
 The removal of the secondary armament , the rear turrets and their supporting structures was generally compensated by the addition of the flight deck , hangar , AA guns and more fuel , and the <unk> height increased <unk> metres ( 9 @.@ 1 in ) to 2 @.@ 81 metres ( 9 ft 3 in ) at full load as a result of the reduction in the displacement by over 2 @,@ 000 tonnes ( 2 @,@ 000 long tons ) to 40 @,@ <unk> tonnes ( 39 @,@ 805 long tons ) . This also reduced the draught to 9 @.@ 03 metres ( 29 ft 8 in ) . The overhang of the flight deck at the stern increased the overall length to 219 @.@ 62 metres ( 720 ft 6 in ) and the beam was slightly reduced to 31 @.@ 71 metres ( 104 ft 0 in ) . 
 When Japan began the Pacific War on 8 December , the sisters sortied for the <unk> Islands with four other battleships and the light carrier <unk> as distant cover for the fleet attacking Pearl Harbor , and returned six days later . On 11 March 1942 <unk> and <unk> sortied from their anchorage at <unk> to join the unsuccessful search for the American carrier force that had attacked Marcus Island a week earlier . Similarly they pursued but did not catch the American carriers that had launched the <unk> Raid on 18 April . 
 They returned home on 14 June and the <unk> began preliminary planning to replace the lost carriers with hybrid carriers converted from battleships . The sisters were selected for conversion and detached from the division on 14 July in preparation . They remained on " standby alert " until the actual <unk> began . <unk> was converted at <unk> Naval Arsenal from 23 February to 5 September 1943 and <unk> at <unk> Naval Arsenal from 2 May to 30 November . 
 After completing her sea trials , <unk> was attached to the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy at <unk> and ferried troops and munitions to the naval base at <unk> in October . In November the ship began working up , joined by the newly completed <unk> the following month , and both rejoined the 2nd Battleship Division . On 1 May 1944 , the sisters were transferred to Rear Admiral <unk> <unk> 's reformed Fourth Carrier Division of the 3rd Fleet . The division 's <unk> Naval Air Group was formed that same day and conducted its first catapult launches in late June . 
 Although they had lost contact during the night , the Americans did find the Japanese carriers at 07 : 35 . They had already launched an <unk> of 180 aircraft that was orbiting 50 miles ( 80 km ) ahead of the American carriers while waiting for the Japanese ships to be located . This was just the first of a total of five airstrikes that the Americans launched that day . The sisters were not heavily engaged by the early airstrikes which are focusing on the group 's aircraft carriers . <unk> claimed to have shot down five attacking dive bombers from the second wave and one small bomb detonated on <unk> No. 2 . <unk> was lightly damaged by near misses that rupture some hull plating in her <unk> and <unk> her superstructure with splinters . She took on a 5 @-@ degree list that was quickly corrected before she was ordered to tow the crippled carrier <unk> to safety . Her attempt was unsuccessful and <unk> had to be abandoned to her fate . 
 In early November the <unk> were removed from both ships , and they loaded troops and munitions later that month . While en route they were diverted to the <unk> Islands upon reports of heavy air raids at Manila . After off @-@ loading their cargo , they sailed for <unk> Island , near Singapore , on 20 November . They transferred to Cam <unk> Bay , French Indochina and <unk> became flagship of the 5th Fleet there on 14 December . The division sailed for Singapore on 30 December and Vice Admiral <unk> <unk> transferred his flag to the light cruiser <unk> on arrival there the following day . The division continued onwards to <unk> . Its planned return to Japan was delayed by attacks by the American Third Fleet on targets in Indochina and southern China that sank two oil tankers that were intended to refuel the division . 
 The <unk> then decided to use the sisters and their escorts to bring a load of petrol , rubber , tin and other strategic minerals back to Japan after the American carriers departed the South China Sea ( Operation <unk> ) . They loaded their cargoes beginning on 6 February at Singapore and departed four days later . Also carrying some 1 @,@ 150 <unk> workers , they were escorted by <unk> and three destroyers . <unk> Japanese radio signals revealed the Japanese plan to the Allies , and 15 submarines were positioned along their anticipated route in an attempt to intercept and sink the ships . An additional 11 were moved into position while the group was en route , but only three were ultimately able to attack . None of them were successful before the Japanese reached <unk> on 20 February . The Fourth Carrier Division was disbanded on 1 March and the sisters were reduced to 1st rank reserve ships . On 19 March <unk> was attacked by aircraft from Task Force 58 and <unk> was hit three times by bombs that killed 37 men and wounded 52 . Her gunners claimed to have shot down one American dive bomber during the attack . <unk> was hit twice during the attack , but her casualties , if any , are unknown . 
 The ships were turned into floating AA batteries over the next several months although it <unk> them little when they were attacked again by American carrier aircraft in July . On the 24th <unk> was struck by five bombs and near missed multiple times ; all told she lost 50 crewmen killed and many others wounded . The bombs started numerous leaks and <unk> began to settle by the bow , although she was returned to an even keel after three @-@ days pumping . <unk> was a primary focus of the attack and she received 10 direct hits and up to 30 near misses . She was badly damaged with some 200 @-@ odd crewmen killed and 600 wounded during the attack . She slowly <unk> over the next two days and was not attacked when the Americans returned four days later . This time it was <unk> 's turn and she was struck 11 or more times with many near misses that put her on the bottom in shallow water with a 15 degree list . The sisters were struck off the Navy List in November and their wrecks were scrapped after the war . 
 Richard Gale " Dick " <unk> ( August 21 , 1926 – December 5 , 1994 ) was an American football player and a pioneering television broadcaster for the forerunner to <unk> @-@ TV in Buffalo . He played college football for the University of Michigan Wolverines in 1944 and from 1946 to 1948 . He was a consensus selection at end on the 1948 College Football All @-@ America Team . <unk> played professionally in the National Football League ( NFL ) with the Detroit Lions for one season in 1950 . After retiring from football he settled in Buffalo and became a sports broadcaster . He worked as a color commentator and as a play @-@ by @-@ play announcer for the Buffalo Bulls . He hosted various television and radio sports shows and was eventually inducted into the Buffalo <unk> Hall of Fame . 
 In college , he led the Big Ten Conference in single season receptions during his senior year and set Michigan Wolverines receptions records for both career touchdown and single @-@ season touchdowns . He had also been a Michigan High School Athletic Association ( <unk> ) state champion in both basketball and track and field . His college career was interrupted by World War II service , and his high school career was also affected by the war due to the <unk> 's cancellation of state championships in all sports in 1943 . 
 <unk> was born in <unk> , Michigan , and raised in Kalamazoo , Michigan before his family moved to Saginaw , Michigan . <unk> was a star athlete at Saginaw 's Arthur Hill High School in football , basketball , and track and field . In 1943 , Michigan canceled boys high school tournaments in all sports due to World War II , and they did not return until the fall of 1944 . In 1944 , he led Arthur Hill High to the <unk> Class A high school basketball championship ( over Kalamazoo Central High School ) , scoring 24 points , including 17 in the second half , of the championship game . <unk> was also the state champion in 1944 in both the shot put 46 feet 11 inches ( 14 @.@ 30 m ) and high jump 5 feet 8 @.@ 5 inches ( 1 @.@ 74 m ) . He also led Arthur Hill in football , and his high school accomplishments are featured in Glory : The history of Saginaw County sports by Jack <unk> ( ASIN <unk> ) , which is a book on high school sports in Saginaw County , Michigan . <unk> was named All State in football , basketball and track . 
 In the 1948 championship season , <unk> scored eight touchdowns , caught 22 passes , and gained 610 yards ( 508 receiving and 102 rushing ) . <unk> was the second highest scoring end in the nation in 1948 , and he was a consensus All @-@ American as a senior , being selected as first team on nine of the 11 All @-@ American teams . <unk> led the Big Ten in receptions . 
 Although <unk> finished fourth among <unk> <unk> voters in 1948 , he did not finish among the top eight . By comparison , Notre Dame end Leon Hart won the <unk> Trophy in 1949 but made only eight of the 11 All @-@ American teams . It is not clear why <unk> did not finish higher . However , it is fairly clear that sportswriters of that era had a bias against Michigan . In the Associated Press poll at the end of the 1947 season , the Notre Dame Fighting Irish were ranked ahead of the University of Michigan , though both teams were undefeated . Some noted that every Southern AP <unk> had voted for Notre Dame , which had yet to integrate , whereas three of Michigan 's star players ( Bob Mann , Gene <unk> , and Len Ford ) were African @-@ American . The Southern schools refused even to schedule games against schools that played African @-@ American players . 
 <unk> was considered one of the greatest <unk> 's of the 1940s . In four seasons with the Michigan Wolverines , <unk> played in 32 games and had over 1 @,@ 000 yards of total offense . <unk> held the University of Michigan 's single season and career record for touchdown receptions ( eight in a season ; sixteen career ) until his records were broken by Anthony Carter in 1980 . 
 In 1948 , <unk> was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the 15th round of the NFL draft , and he was also drafted by the New York Yankees of the All @-@ America Football Conference . He had intended to play in 1949 with the Yankees , but suffered a knee injury in a practice session for the August 1949 Chicago College All @-@ Star Game . Press accounts at the time noted that the injury " will probably keep him out of pro football all season , if not forever . " The incident led to a debate as to whether NFL owners should " bar their men from playing with the college all @-@ stars . " 
 <unk> landed a job at <unk> radio in Detroit , but he left his <unk> 's job to join the Detroit Lions . In the 1950 NFL season , <unk> came back from his injury to play for the Detroit Lions . He played in 12 games and had ten receptions for 96 yards and one touchdown for the 1950 Lions . <unk> recalled that his playing time with the Lions was limited because the Lions also signed 1949 <unk> Trophy winner Leon Hart , who played the same position . 
 In May 1951 , he announced he was retiring from professional football to become sports director at a radio station in Buffalo . He was hired as a <unk> by <unk> ( now known as <unk> ) , which had just started the first television station in Buffalo and the only one serving Southern Ontario . This was an early foray into television by the Buffalo Evening News . In the 1950s , <unk> hosted a popular panel show called " Let 's Talk Sports " in Buffalo and also pioneered an early morning exercise program . He also worked for <unk> ( AM ) and <unk> ( FM ) and as the <unk> announcer for Buffalo Bills games along with Van Miller , the long time Bills play @-@ by @-@ play announcer . In addition , he served as the play @-@ by @-@ play announcer for the University of Buffalo Bulls football team . As a radio broadcaster , he is remembered for things ranging from <unk> reports , to 17 years worth of " <unk> At — " programs live from various local restaurants , to 27 years as the <unk> @-@ AM All Night Show host . 
 After 30 years with <unk> and a change in ownership for the station , his show was replaced with the <unk> Network 's The Larry King Show . In the 1980s , <unk> taught communications at Buffalo 's <unk> College and served as a disc jockey on Public Broadcasting 's radio station <unk> ( now <unk> ) . He also sold <unk> for Buffalo Evening News competitor , Buffalo Courier @-@ Express . <unk> 's final employer was Erie County , who hired him as an inmate training supervisor at the Erie County <unk> <unk> . 
 <unk> was posthumously inducted into the Buffalo <unk> Hall of Fame in September 2007 . He was given the Golden Age Award which is reserved for " those who did it first , the people who had no pattern to follow . " The Hall of Fame award was presented to <unk> 's wife , Jane . In her acceptance speech , Jane <unk> observed that despite all of her late husband 's achievements , there was one thing he had never received : " He had a great career , but he never had a trophy . And now he has . " 
 <unk> lived 37 of his years in Buffalo . His wife , the former Jane Morris , was the head of the Buffalo <unk> <unk> when they met . <unk> , who was survived by three sons , ( Douglas A. , Gary R. , and Bruce R. ) one daughter ( Wendy J. <unk> ) and two grandchildren , died in <unk> , New York in December 1994 ; he was 68 years old . Doug was a 1988 first team football All @-@ Western New York linebacker for Clarence High School . 
 The 1933 Treasure Coast hurricane was the second @-@ most intense tropical cyclone to strike the United States during the active 1933 Atlantic hurricane season . The eleventh tropical storm , fifth hurricane , and the third major hurricane of the season , it formed east @-@ northeast of the Leeward Islands on August 31 . The tropical storm moved rapidly west @-@ northwestward , steadily intensifying to a hurricane . It acquired peak winds of 140 miles per hour ( 225 km / h ) and passed over portions of the Bahamas on September 3 , including <unk> and Harbour Island , causing severe damage to crops , buildings , and infrastructure . Winds over 100 mph ( 161 km / h ) affected many islands in its path , especially those that encountered its center , and many wharves were ruined . 
 Subsequently , it weakened and made landfall at Jupiter , Florida , early on September 4 with winds of 125 mph ( 201 km / h ) . The hurricane moved across the state , passing near Tampa before moving into Georgia and dissipating . In Florida , the strong winds of the cyclone blew buildings off their foundations , and numerous trees were <unk> in citrus groves . The Treasure Coast region received the most extensive destruction , and Stuart , Jupiter , and Fort Pierce were heavily damaged . Inland , the cyclone weakened rapidly but produced prodigious amounts of rain , causing a dam to collapse near Tampa . The storm caused $ 3 million in damage ( 1933 USD ) after damaging or destroying 6 @,@ <unk> homes . 
 Unusually , the storm hit Florida less than 24 hours before another major hurricane bearing 125 @-@ mile @-@ per @-@ hour ( 201 km / h ) winds struck South Texas ; never have two major cyclones hit the United States in such close succession . 
 The origins of the hurricane were from a tropical wave that possibly spawned a tropical depression on August 27 , although there was minimal data over the next few days as it tracked to the west @-@ northwest . On August 31 , a nearby ship reported gale force winds , which indicated that a tropical storm had developed to the east @-@ northeast of the Lesser Antilles . Based on continuity , it is estimated the storm attained hurricane status later that day . Moving quickly to the west @-@ northwest , the storm passed north of the Lesser Antilles and Puerto Rico . Early on September 2 , a ship called the <unk> reported a barometric pressure of 978 mbar ( 28 @.@ 88 inHg ) , which confirmed that the storm attained hurricane status . After passing north of the Turks and <unk> islands , the hurricane struck <unk> and Harbour Island in the Bahamas on September 3 , the latter at 1100 UTC . A station on the latter island reported a pressure of 27 @.@ 90 inHg ( <unk> mb ) during the 30 minute passage of the eye . Based on the pressure and the small size of the storm , it is estimated the hurricane struck Harbour Island with peak winds of 140 mph ( 225 km / h ) , making it the equivalent of a modern Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson scale . <unk> suggested that the storm reached major hurricane status , or Category 3 status , on September 2 . 
 The hurricane initially followed the course of another hurricane that passed through the area in late August , which ultimately struck Cuba and Texas . This hurricane instead maintained a general west @-@ northwest track . After moving through the northern Bahamas , the hurricane weakened slightly before making landfall at Jupiter , Florida , at <unk> UTC on September 4 . A station there reported a pressure of 27 @.@ 98 inHg ( <unk> mb ) during a 40 minute period of the eye 's passage ; this suggested a landfall strength of 125 mph ( 201 km / h ) . At the time , the radius of maximum winds was 15 mi ( 24 km ) , which was smaller than average . After landfall , the hurricane weakened rapidly while crossing the state . It briefly emerged into the Gulf of Mexico as a tropical storm early on September 5 . A few hours later while continuing to the northwest , it made another landfall near <unk> — a ghost town in Levy County , east of Cedar Key — with winds of about 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) . Turning to the north , the storm slowly weakened as it crossed into Georgia , dissipating on September 7 near Augusta . 
 On September 2 , a fleet of eight aircraft evacuated all white residents from West End , Grand <unk> , to <unk> Beach , Florida . While the storm was near peak intensity on September 3 , the Weather Bureau issued hurricane warnings from Miami to Melbourne , Florida , with storm warnings extending northward to Jacksonville . Later that day , storm warnings , were issued from Key West to Cedar Key . About 2 @,@ 500 people evacuated by train from areas around Lake Okeechobee . By evening on September 3 , high tides sent sea <unk> over coastal <unk> in Palm Beach County as residents boarded up buildings ; structures on <unk> Street in West Palm Beach were said to be a " solid front " of <unk> . Along the coast , observers reported very rough seas as the eye neared land . 
 The powerful hurricane moved over or near several islands in the Bahamas . Winds on Spanish Wells and Harbour Island were both estimated at around 140 mph ( 225 km / h ) . Winds reached 110 mph ( 177 km / h ) at Governor 's Harbour , 100 mph ( 161 km / h ) on <unk> , and 120 mph ( 193 km / h ) on the <unk> Islands . The storm was farther away from Nassau , where winds reached 61 mph ( 98 km / h ) . The hurricane damaged a lumber mill on <unk> , <unk> away a dock . Heavy damage occurred on Harbour Island , including to several roofs , the walls of government buildings , and the water system . The hurricane destroyed four churches and 37 houses , leaving 100 people homeless . A 1 @.@ 5 mi ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) road on <unk> was destroyed . Several islands sustained damage to farms , including the total loss of various fruit trees on Russell Island . Despite Category 4 winds on Spanish Wells , only five houses were destroyed , although most of the remaining dwellings lost their roofs . <unk> between North Point , James <unk> , and Gregory Town on <unk> , the storm destroyed 55 houses and damaged many others . On Grand <unk> , where a 9 to 12 ft ( 2 @.@ 7 to 3 @.@ 7 m ) storm surge was reported , half of the houses were destroyed , as were 13 boats and two planes , and most docks were wrecked . 
 When the storm moved ashore in Florida , winds reached an estimated 125 mph ( 201 km / h ) in Jupiter ; these occurred after the eye passed . In West Palm Beach , <unk> measured at least 80 @-@ mile @-@ per @-@ hour ( 129 km / h ) winds with gusts to 100 mph ( 161 km / h ) ; <unk> ranged from 28 @.@ 64 to 28 @.@ 78 inHg ( 970 to <unk> mb ) . The storm produced the strongest winds in the city since the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane . Winds were not as strong farther from the center ; 40 to 45 mph ( 64 to 72 km / h ) winds were observed in Miami to the south , <unk> to the north , and Tampa on the west coast . Fort Pierce estimated peak winds of 80 to 90 mph ( 129 to 145 km / h ) , and pressures dipped to 29 @.@ 14 inHg ( <unk> mb ) . Inland , winds near Lake Okeechobee peaked at only 60 mph ( 97 km / h ) . The hurricane dropped heavy rainfall along its path , peaking at 17 @.@ 8 in ( 450 mm ) in <unk> . 
 At West Palm Beach , the majority of the damage was confined to vegetation . Several <unk> and royal <unk> that withstood the 1928 hurricane snapped , <unk> streets with broken trunks . Winds downed road signs on many streets , and <unk> covered the <unk> on a local golf course . Some <unk> and isolated structures , mostly lightweight , were partly or totally destroyed , along with a lumber warehouse . Some homes that lost roofing shingles had water damage to their interiors as well . Nearby Lake Worth sustained extensive breakage of windows , including plate glass , and loss of tile and <unk> roofing , but preparations reduced losses to just several thousand dollars , and no post @-@ storm accidents took place . Strong winds snapped many light poles in the city , and trees and shrubs were broken or uprooted . As in Lake Worth , officials in West Palm Beach credited preparations and stringent building codes with reducing overall damage . The city had learned from previous experience with severe storms in 1926 , 1928 , and 1929 . High tides eroded Ocean Boulevard at several spots and disrupted access to several bridges on the Lake Worth <unk> . Winter estates and hotels on Palm Beach generally sustained little material damage , except to vegetation , and county properties went largely unscathed . 
 High rainfall caused flooding across Florida , notably near Tampa where waters reached 9 ft ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) deep . High rainfall of over 7 in ( 180 mm ) caused a dam operated by Tampa Electric Co. to break 3 mi ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) northeast of Tampa along the <unk> River . The break resulted in severe local damage , flooding portions of <unk> Springs . Workers attempted to save the dam with <unk> , and after the break , most residents in the area were warned of the approaching flood . Over 50 homes were flooded , forcing about 150 people to evacuate . Outside Florida , the storm produced winds of 48 and 51 mph ( 78 and 81 km / h ) in Savannah , Georgia and Charleston , South Carolina , respectively . In the latter city , the storm spawned a tornado , which caused about $ 10 @,@ 000 in property damage . Heavy rainfall occurred along the Georgia and South Carolina coasts , reaching over 12 in ( 300 mm ) . Light rainfall also extended into North Carolina . 
 In the Bahamas after the storm , a boat sailed from Nassau to deliver food and building materials to <unk> . 
 After the storm , the National Guard offered shelters for at least 400 homeless residents in Stuart . Of the 7 @,@ 900 families adversely affected by the hurricane , 4 @,@ 325 required assistance from the American Red Cross . <unk> in Texas , also affected by a major hurricane , requested <unk> in Florida wait 15 days so they could sell their citrus crop that fell . The damaged dam near Tampa initially resulted in waters from the <unk> River being pumped into the city 's water treatment plant , and a new dam was eventually built in 1944 . 
 The Second Battle of <unk> <unk> was an engagement between United Nations ( UN ) and North Korean ( <unk> ) forces early in the Korean War from September 1 to September 15 , 1950 , along the <unk> River in South Korea . It was a part of the Battle of Pusan Perimeter , and was one of several large engagements fought simultaneously . The battle ended in a victory for the United Nations after large numbers of United States ( US ) and Republic of Korea ( ROK ) troops repelled a strong North Korean attack . 
 After the First Battle of <unk> <unk> , the US Army 's 2nd Infantry Division was moved to defend the <unk> River line . The division , which was <unk> in combat , was struck with a strong attack by several divisions of the Korean People 's Army which crossed the river and struck all along the division 's line . The force of the attack split the US 2nd Infantry Division in half , and the North Koreans were able to penetrate to <unk> , promoting a fight there . 
 The urgency of the threat to Pusan Perimeter prompted the US Marine Corps 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to be brought in to reinforce the US Army troops . In two weeks of heavy fighting , the US forces were able to force the North Koreans out of the <unk> <unk> region . The North Koreans were further repulsed after the UN counterattack at <unk> , which culminated in the virtual destruction of the North Korean army . 
 From the outbreak of the Korean War and the invasion of South Korea by the North , the North Korean People 's Army had enjoyed superiority in both manpower and equipment over both the Republic of Korea Army and the United Nations forces dispatched to South Korea to prevent it from collapsing . The North Korean strategy was to aggressively pursue UN and ROK forces on all avenues of approach south and to engage them aggressively , attacking from the front and initiating a double <unk> of both flanks of the unit , which allowed the North Koreans to surround and cut off the opposing force , which would then be forced to retreat in <unk> , often leaving behind much of its equipment . From their initial June 25 offensive to fights in July and early August , the North Koreans used this strategy to effectively defeat any UN force and push it south . However , when the UN forces , under the Eighth United States Army , established the Pusan Perimeter in August , the UN troops held a continuous line along the peninsula which North Korean troops could not flank , and their advantages in numbers decreased daily as the superior UN logistical system brought in more troops and supplies to the UN army . 
 In planning its new offensive , the North Korean command decided any attempt to flank the UN force was impossible thanks to the support of the UN navy . Instead , they opted to use frontal attack to breach the perimeter and collapse it as the only hope of achieving success in the battle . <unk> by intelligence from the Soviet Union the North Koreans were aware the UN forces were building up along the Pusan Perimeter and that it must conduct an offensive soon or it could not win the battle . A secondary objective was to surround <unk> and destroy the UN and ROK units in that city . As part of this mission , the North Korean units would first cut the supply lines to <unk> . 
 On August 20 , the North Korean commands distributed operations orders to their subordinate units . The North Koreans called for a simultaneous five @-@ <unk> attack against the UN lines . These attacks would overwhelm the UN defenders and allow the North Koreans to break through the lines in at least one place to force the UN forces back . Five battle groupings were ordered . The center attack called for the <unk> 9th Division , <unk> 4th Division , <unk> 2nd Division , and <unk> 10th Division break through the US 2nd Infantry Division at the <unk> <unk> to <unk> and <unk> . 
 During the North Koreans ' September 1 offensive , the US 25th Infantry Division 's US 35th Infantry Regiment was heavily engaged in the Battle of <unk> River north of <unk> . On the 35th Regiment 's right flank , just north of the confluence of the <unk> River and the <unk> River , was the US 9th Infantry Regiment , US 2nd Infantry Division . There , in the southernmost part of the 2nd Infantry Division zone , the 9th Infantry Regiment held a sector more than 20 @,@ 000 yards ( 18 @,@ 000 m ) long , including the <unk> area of the <unk> where the First Battle of <unk> <unk> had taken place earlier in August . Each US infantry company on the river line here had a front of 3 @,@ 000 feet ( 910 m ) to 4 @,@ 000 feet ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) and they held only key hills and observation points , as the units were extremely spread out along the wide front . 
 During the last week of August , US troops on these hills could see minor North Korean activity across the river , which they thought was North Koreans organizing the high ground on the west side of the <unk> against a possible American attack . There were occasional attacks on the 9th Infantry 's forward positions , but to the men in the front lines this appeared to be only a standard patrol action . On August 31 , the UN forces were alerted to a pending attack when much of the Korean civilian labor force fled the front lines . Intelligence officers reported an attack was coming . 
 On the southern @-@ most flank of the 9th Infantry river line , just above the junction of the <unk> River with the <unk> , A Company of the 1st Battalion was dug in on a long finger ridge <unk> the <unk> that terminates in Hill 94 at the <unk> ferry site . The river road from <unk> @-@ ri running west along the <unk> passes the southern tip of this ridge and crosses to the west side of the river at the ferry . A small village called <unk> lay at the base of Hill 94 and 300 yards ( 270 m ) from the river . A patrol of tanks and armored vehicles , together with two infantry squads of A Company , 9th Infantry , held a roadblock near the ferry and close to <unk> . On the evening of August 31 , A Company moved from its ridge positions overlooking <unk> and the river to new positions along the river below the ridge line . 
 That evening Sergeant Ernest R. <unk> led the patrol of two <unk> <unk> tanks and two <unk> Gun Motor <unk> in <unk> . <unk> placed his patrol on the west side of <unk> near the <unk> ferry . At 20 : 00 a heavy fog covered the river , and at 22 : 00 mortar shells began falling on the American @-@ held side of the river . By 22 : 15 this strike intensified and North Korean mortar preparation struck A Company 's positions . American mortars and artillery began firing <unk> . Some of the A Company men reported they heard noises on the opposite side of the river and splashes in the water . 
 At 22 : 30 the fog lifted and <unk> saw that a North Korean <unk> bridge was being laid across the river directly in front of his position . <unk> 's four vehicles attacked this structure , and after about a minute of heavy fire the bridge collapsed , and the <unk> boats used to hold the bridge in place were sunk . At 23 : 00 a small arms fight flared around the left side of A Company north of the tanks . This gunfire had lasted only two or three minutes when the A Company roadblock squads near the tanks received word by field telephone that the company was withdrawing to the original ridge positions and that they should do likewise . 
 <unk> 's patrol was then ambushed by a group of North Koreans dressed in US military uniforms . <unk> was wounded and the other three vehicles had to withdraw , but he held the <unk> site until 07 : 30 the next morning with his single tank . In the attack against A Company , the North Koreans hit the 1st Platoon , which was near <unk> , but they did not find the 2nd Platoon northward . 
 The <unk> 9th Division 's infantry crossing of the <unk> and attack on its east side near midnight quickly overran the positions of C Company , north of A Company . There the North Koreans assaulted in force , signaled by green flares and blowing of whistles . The company held its positions only a short time and then attempted to escape . Many of the men moved south , a few of them coming into A Company 's ridge line positions near <unk> during the night . Most of C Company moved all the way to the 25th Division positions south of the <unk> . On September 1 that division reported that 110 men of C Company had come into its lines . 
 Meanwhile , 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) north of <unk> and A Company 's position , B Company , 9th Infantry , held a similar position on Hill <unk> overlooking the <unk> ferry crossing of the river . This ferry was located at the middle of the <unk> <unk> where the <unk> road came down to the <unk> and crossed it . The US 2nd Infantry Division had planned a reconnaissance mission to start from there the night of August 31 , the same night that the <unk> I Corps offensive rolled across the river . 
 Near the end of the month two reconnaissance patrols from the 9th Infantry had crossed to the west side of the <unk> and observed North Korean tank and troop activity 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) west of the river . Information obtained later indicated it was in fact the command post of the <unk> 9th Division . On August 25 , 9th Infantry commander Colonel John G. Hill outlined projected " Operation <unk> , " which was to be a company @-@ sized combat patrol to cross the river , advance to the suspected North Korean command post and communications center , destroy it , capture prisoners , and collect intelligence . 
 The 9th Infantry Regiment had planned Task Force <unk> on orders from the 2nd Division commander Major General Laurence B. <unk> , which in turn had received instructions from Eighth United States Army commander Lieutenant General Walton Walker for aggressive patrolling . <unk> decided the patrol should cross the river at the <unk> ferry . The 9th Infantry reserve , E Company , reinforced with one section of light machine guns from H Company , was to be the attack force . The 1st Platoon , 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion , was to transport it across the river in assault boats the night of August 31 . Two heavy weapons companies , D and H , were each to <unk> one section of heavy machine guns , one section of 81 @-@ <unk> mortars , and one section of 75 @-@ <unk> recoilless rifles for supporting fires . A platoon of 4 @.@ 2 @-@ inch mortars was also to give support . 
 After dark on August 31 , First Lieutenant Charles I. Caldwell of D Company and First Lieutenant Edward <unk> of H Company , 9th Infantry , moved their men and weapons to the base of Hill <unk> , which was within B Company 's defense sector and overlooked the <unk> ferry crossing of the <unk> River . The raiding force , E Company , was still in its regimental reserve position about 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) west of <unk> , getting ready with the engineer platoon to move to the crossing site . Colonel Hill went forward in the evening with the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ inch mortar platoon to its position at the base of Hill <unk> where the <unk> prepared to set up their weapons . 
 By 21 : 00 , the closest front line unit was B Company on top of Hill <unk> , 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) north of the river road which curved around the hill 's southern base . The regimental <unk> , Captain Lewis B. Sheen , had gone forward in the afternoon to B Company to hold services . On top of Hill <unk> , <unk> Sheen and men in B Company after dark heard <unk> in the water below them . They soon discovered a long line of North Korean soldiers wading the river . 
 The first North Korean crossing at the <unk> ferry caught the Heavy <unk> Platoon unprepared in the act of setting up its weapons . It also caught most of the D and H Company men at the base of Hill <unk> , <unk> miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) from the crossing site . The North Koreans killed or captured many of the troops there . Hill was there , but escaped to the rear just before midnight , together with several others , when the division canceled Operation <unk> because of the attacks . The first heavy weapons carrying party was on its way up the hill when the North Korean attack <unk> the men below . It <unk> on to the top where the advance group waited and there all hastily dug in on a small perimeter . This group was not attacked during the night . 
 From 21 : 30 until shortly after midnight the <unk> 9th Division crossed the <unk> at a number of places and climbed the hills quietly toward the 9th Infantry river line positions . Then , when the artillery barrage preparation lifted , the North Korean infantry were in position to launch their assaults . These began in the northern part of the regimental sector and quickly spread southward . At each crossing site the North Koreans would overwhelm local UN defenders before building <unk> bridges for their vehicles and armor . 
 At 02 : 00 , B Company was attacked . A truck stopped at the bottom of the hill , a whistle sounded , then came a shouted order , and North Korean soldiers started climbing the slope . The hills on both sides of B Company were already under attack as was also Hill 311 , a rugged terrain feature a 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) from the river and the North Koreans ' principal immediate objective . The North Koreans apparently were not aware of the Task Force <unk> group lower down on the hill and it was not attacked during the night . But higher up on Hill <unk> the North Koreans drove B Company from its position , inflicting very heavy casualties on it . Sheen led one group of soldiers back to friendly lines on 4 September . 
 North of the 9th Infantry sector of the 2nd Infantry Division front along the <unk> , the US 23rd Infantry Regiment on August 29 had just relieved the 3rd Battalion of the US 38th Infantry Regiment , which in turn had only a few days before relieved the US 21st Infantry Regiment of the US 24th Infantry Division . On August 1 , the 23rd Regiment was in a new sector of which it had only a limited knowledge . It took over a 16 @,@ 000 yards ( 15 @,@ 000 m ) <unk> River front without its 3rd Battalion which had been attached to the US 1st Cavalry Division to the north . Colonel Paul L. Freeman , the regimental commander , deployed the 1st Battalion on the high ground along the river with the three companies abreast . The 1st Battalion , under US Lieutenant Colonel Claire E. <unk> , Jr . , <unk> the hills with platoons and squads . He placed the 2nd Battalion in a reserve position 8 miles ( 13 km ) behind the 1st Battalion and in a position where it commanded the road net in the regimental sector . On August <unk> the 2nd Division moved E Company south to a reserve position in the 9th Infantry sector . 
 Two roads ran through the regimental sector from the <unk> River to <unk> . The main road bent south along the east bank of the river to <unk> @-@ <unk> and then turned northeast to <unk> . A northern secondary road curved around <unk> and lakes , the largest of which was Lake U @-@ p <unk> , to <unk> . In effect , the 1st Battalion of the 23rd Regiment guarded these two approach routes to <unk> . 
 The 42 men of the 2nd Platoon , B Company , 23rd Infantry held outpost positions on seven hills covering a 2 @,@ 600 yards ( 2 @,@ 400 m ) front along the east bank of the <unk> north of <unk> @-@ <unk> . Across the river in the rice <unk> they could see , in the afternoon of August 31 , two large groups of North Korean soldiers . Occasionally artillery fire dispersed them . Just before dark , the platoon saw a column of North Koreans come out of the hills and proceed toward the river . They immediately reported to the battalion command post . The artillery forward observer , who estimated the column at 2 @,@ 000 people , thought they were refugees . Freeman immediately ordered the artillery to fire on the column , reducing its number . However the North Koreans continued their advance . 
 At 21 : 00 the first shells of what proved to be a two @-@ hour North Korean artillery and mortar preparation against the American river positions of 2nd Platoon . As the barrage rolled on , North Korean infantry crossed the river and climbed the hills in the darkness under cover of its fire . At 23 : 00 the barrage lifted and the North Koreans attacked 2nd Platoon , forcing it from the hill after a short fight . Similar assaults took place elsewhere along the battalion outpost line . 
 On the regimental left along the main <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> road North Korean soldiers completely overran C Company by 0300 September 1 . Only seven men of C Company could be accounted for , and three days later , after all the stragglers and those cut off behind North Korean lines had come in , there were only 20 men in the company . As the North Korean attack developed during the night , 1st Battalion succeeded in withdrawing a large part of its force , less C Company , just north of Lake U @-@ p <unk> and the hills there covering the northern road into <unk> , 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) east of the river and 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) west of the town . B Company lost heavily in this action . 
 Before the morning of 1 September had passed , reports coming in to US 2nd Division headquarters made it clear that North Koreans had penetrated to the north @-@ south <unk> @-@ <unk> road and cut the division in two ; the 38th and <unk> Infantry Regiments with the bulk of the division artillery in the north were separated from the division headquarters and the 9th Infantry Regiment in the south . <unk> decided that this situation made it <unk> to control and direct the divided division as two special forces . Accordingly , he placed the division artillery commander , Brigadier General Loyal M. Haynes , in command of the northern group . Haynes ' command post was 7 miles ( 11 km ) north of <unk> . Task Force Haynes became operational at 10 : 20 , September 1 . <unk> , in the <unk> area , <unk> placed Brigadier General Joseph S. Bradley , Assistant Division Commander , in charge of the 9th Infantry Regiment , the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion , most of the 72nd Tank Battalion , and other <unk> units of the division . This southern grouping was known as Task Force Bradley . 
 All three regiments of the <unk> 2nd Division @-@ the 4th , 17th , and 6th , in line from north to south @-@ crossed during the night to the east side of the <unk> River into the 23rd Regiment sector . The <unk> 2nd Division , concentrated in the <unk> @-@ <unk> area west of the river , had , in effect , attacked straight east across the river and was trying to seize the two avenues of advance into <unk> above and below Lake U @-@ p <unk> . On August 31 , 1950 , Lake U @-@ p <unk> was a large body of water although in most places very shallow . 
 <unk> planes rose from the division strip every hour to observe the North Korean progress and to locate US 2nd Infantry Division front @-@ line units . Communication from division and regimental headquarters to nearly all the forward units was broken . Beginning at 09 : 30 and continuing throughout the rest of the day , the light aviation section of the division artillery located front @-@ line units cut off by the North Koreans , and made fourteen <unk> of ammunition , food , water , and medical supplies . As information slowly built up at division headquarters it became apparent that the North Koreans had punched a hole 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) wide and 8 miles ( 13 km ) deep in the middle of the division line and made less severe <unk> elsewhere . The front @-@ line battalions of the US 9th and 23rd Regiments were in various states of <unk> and some companies had virtually disappeared . <unk> hoped he could organize a defense along the <unk> @-@ <unk> road east of the <unk> River , and prevent North Korean access to the passes eastward leading to <unk> and Ch <unk> . 
 At 09 : 00 Walker requested the US Air Force to make a maximum effort along the <unk> River from <unk> @-@ dong , just above the US 2nd Division boundary , southward and to a depth of 15 miles ( 24 km ) west of the river . He wanted the Air Force to isolate the battlefield and prevent further North Korean reinforcements and supplies from moving across the river in support of the North Korean spearhead units . The Far East Command requested the US Navy to join in the air effort , and the US Seventh Fleet turned back from its strikes in the <unk> <unk> @-@ Seoul area and <unk> southward at full steam toward the southern battle front . Walker came to the US 2nd Division front at 12 : 00 and ordered the division to hold at all costs . He had already ordered ground reinforcements to the <unk> area . 
 During the morning of 1 September , Walker weighed the news coming in from his southern front , <unk> in a decision as to which part of the front most needed his Pusan Perimeter reserves . Since midnight the <unk> I Corps had broken his Pusan Perimeter in two places @-@ the <unk> 2nd and 9th Divisions in the US 2nd Division sector , and the <unk> 7th Division and <unk> 6th Division in the US 25th Division sector , below the junction of the <unk> and <unk> Rivers . In the US 2nd Division sector North Korean troops were at the edge of <unk> , the gateway to the corridor leading 12 miles ( 19 km ) eastward to <unk> and the main Pusan @-@ <unk> railroad and highway . 
 Eighth Army had in reserve three <unk> infantry regiments and the 2 @-@ battalion British 27th Infantry Brigade which was not yet completely equipped and ready to be placed in line : The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade at <unk> , 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) northeast of <unk> , preparing for movement to the port of Pusan ; the US 27th Infantry Regiment of the 25th Division which had arrived at <unk> only the night before at 20 : 30 to relieve the 5th Regimental Combat Team , which was then to join the 24th Division in the <unk> area ; and the US 19th Infantry Regiment of the US 24th Infantry Division , then with that division 's headquarters at <unk> southeast of <unk> . Walker alerted both the 24th Division headquarters , together with its 19th Regiment , and the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to move at a moment 's notice ; the 24th Division either to the 2nd or 25th Division fronts , and the marines to an <unk> destination . 
 As the morning passed , General Walker decided that the situation was most critical in the <unk> <unk> area of the US 2nd Division sector . There the North Koreans threatened <unk> and with it the entire Eighth Army position . At 11 : 00 Walker ordered US Marine Corps Brigadier General Edward A. Craig , commanding the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade , to prepare the marines to move at once . The marines made ready to depart for the <unk> <unk> at 13 : 30 . 
 The situation on the front was chaotic during the day September 1 . The North Koreans at one place had crossed at the <unk> ferry , captured <unk> , and scattered A Company , 9th Infantry at its positions from <unk> northward . A Company withdrew to positions on the ridge line back of the river . From there at daylight the men could see North Korean soldiers on many of the ridges surrounding them , most of them moving east . After several hours , 2nd Platoon of A Company sent a patrol down the hill to <unk> to obtain supplies abandoned there during the night , returning later with much needed water , rations , and ammunition . 
 Later in the morning North Korean barges crossed the <unk> below A Company . The company sent a squad with a light machine gun to the southern tip of the ridge overlooking <unk> to take these troops under fire . When the squad reached the tip of the ridge they saw that a North Korean force occupied houses at its base . The company hit these houses with artillery . The North Koreans broke from the houses , running for the river . At this the light machine gun at the tip of the ridge took them under fire , as did another across the <unk> to the south in the US 25th Infantry Division sector . <unk> <unk> artillery fire decimated this group . Combined fire from all weapons inflicted an estimated 300 casualties on this North Korean force . In the afternoon , US aircraft dropped food and ammunition to the company ; only part of it was recovered . The 1st Battalion ordered A Company to withdraw the company that night . 
 During the withdraw , however , A Company ran into a sizable North Korean force and had scattered in the ensuing fight . Most of the company , including its commander were killed at close range . In this desperate action , Private First Class Luther H. Story , a weapons squad leader , fought so <unk> that he was awarded the Medal of Honor . <unk> wounded , Story refused to be a burden to those who might escape , and when last seen was still engaging North Korean at close range . Of those in the company , approximately ten men escaped to friendly lines . The next morning , under heavy fog , the group made its way by <unk> toward <unk> . From a hill at 12 : 00 , after the fog had lifted , the men looked down on the Battle of <unk> which was then in progress . That afternoon 20 survivors of the company merged into the lines of the 72nd Tank Battalion near <unk> . <unk> from this position continued to stream in the next few days as well . 
 During the night <unk> established radio communication with the 1st Battalion , 9th infantry . When daylight came <unk> and his group saw that they were surrounded by North Koreans . One force occupied the higher <unk> half a mile above them , formerly held by B Company . Below them , North Koreans continued crossing the river and moving supplies forward to their combat units , some of them already several miles eastward . The North Koreans quickly discovered Task Force <unk> group . They first attacked it at 14 : 00 that afternoon , and were repulsed . That night an estimated company attacked three times , pressing the fight to close quarters , but failed each time to penetrate the tight US perimeter . <unk> of the second day disclosed many North Korean dead on the steep slopes outside the perimeter . 
 In the afternoon of September 2 <unk> <unk> 1st Battalion for an <unk> of supplies . A US plane attempted the drop , but the perimeter was so small and the slopes so steep that virtually all the supplies went into North Korean hands . The men in the perimeter did , however , recover from a drop made later at 19 : 00 some supplies and ammunition . Private First Class Joseph R. <unk> , of H Company , left the perimeter to gather weapons , ammunition , and grenades from the North Korean dead . On several occasions he was attacked , and on one such occasion a North Korean soldier suddenly attacked <unk> , who killed the North Korean in hand @-@ to @-@ hand combat . 
 That same afternoon , the North Koreans sent an American prisoner up the hill to <unk> with the message , " You have one hour to surrender or be blown to pieces . " <unk> in frontal infantry attack to reduce the little defending force , the North Koreans now meant to take it under mortar fire . Only 45 minutes later North Korean <unk> fire came in on the <unk> and two machine guns from positions northward and higher on the slope of Hill <unk> swept the perimeter . Soon , mortars <unk> on a neighboring high finger ridge eastward registered on <unk> 's perimeter and continued firing until dark . The machine gun fire forced every man to stay in his <unk> . The lifting of the mortar fire after dark was the signal for renewed North Korean infantry attacks , all of which were repulsed . But the number of killed and wounded within the perimeter was growing , and supplies were diminishing . There were no medical supplies except those carried by one aid man . 
 At daylight on the morning of 4 September only two officers and approximately half the men who had assembled on the hill , were alive . As the day passed , with ammunition down to about one clip per man and only a few grenades left and no help in sight , <unk> decided to abandon the position that night . When it got dark the survivors would split into small groups and try to get back to friendly lines . That evening after dark the North Koreans launched another weak attack against the position . At 22 : 00 , <unk> and Caldwell and 27 enlisted men slipped off the hill in groups of four . Master Sergeant Travis E. Watkins , still alive in his <unk> condition , refused efforts of evacuation , saying that he did not want to be a burden to those who had a chance to get away . He asked only that his <unk> be loaded and placed on his chest with the muzzle under his chin . Like <unk> , he would also win the Medal of Honor for his actions . Of the 29 men who came off the hill the night of September 4 , 22 escaped to friendly lines , many of them following the <unk> downstream , hiding by day and traveling by night , until they reached the lines of the US 25th Infantry Division . 
 Members of Task Force <unk> who escaped from Hill <unk> brought back considerable intelligence information of North Korean activity in the vicinity of the <unk> ferry crossing site . At the ferry site the North Koreans had put in an underwater bridge . A short distance downstream , each night they placed a <unk> bridge across the river and took it up before dawn the next morning . <unk> parties of 50 civilians guarded by four North Korean soldiers crossed the river continuously at night , an estimated total of 800 @-@ 1 @,@ 000 carriers being used at this crossing site . 
 North of the US 9th Infantry and the battles in the <unk> <unk> and around <unk> , the US <unk> Infantry Regiment after daylight of September 1 was in a very precarious position . Its 1st Battalion had been driven from the river positions and isolated 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) westward . Approximately 400 North Koreans now overran the regimental command post , compelling Freeman to withdraw it about 600 yards ( 550 m ) . There , 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) northwest of <unk> , the US 23rd Infantry Headquarters and Headquarters Company , <unk> regimental units , and regimental staff officers checked the North Koreans in a 3 @-@ hour fight . 
 The North Koreans advanced to <unk> itself during the afternoon of September 2 , and ROK National Police withdrew from the town . North Koreans were in <unk> that evening . With his communications broken southward to the 2nd Infantry Division headquarters and the 9th Infantry , Haynes during the day decided to send a tank patrol down the <unk> road in an effort to re @-@ establish communication . C Company , 72nd Tank Battalion , led its tanks southward . They had to fight their way down the road through several roadblocks . Of the three tanks that started , only the lead tank got through to <unk> . There , it delivered an <unk> of Task Force Haynes ' positions to Bradley . 
 Still farther northward in the zone of the US 38th Infantry the North Koreans were also active . After the North Korean breakthrough during the night of August 31 , <unk> had ordered the 2nd Battalion , 38th Infantry , to move south and help the 23rd Infantry establish a defensive position west of <unk> . In attempting to do this , the battalion found North Korean troops already on the ridges along the road . They had penetrated to Hill <unk> overlooking the 38th Infantry command post . This hill and Hill <unk> dominated the rear areas of the regiment . At 06 : 00 September 3 , 300 North Koreans launched an attack from Hill <unk> against the 38th Regiment command post . The regimental commander organized a defensive perimeter and requested a bombing strike which was denied him because the enemy target and his defense perimeter were too close to each other . But the Air Force did deliver rocket and <unk> strikes . 
 This fight continued until September 5 . On that day F Company captured Hill <unk> killing 150 North Koreans . From the crest he and his men watched as many more North Koreans ran into a village below them . Directed artillery fire destroyed the village . Among the abandoned North Korean materiel on the hill , <unk> 's men found twenty @-@ five American <unk> and <unk> guns , a large American radio , thirty boxes of <unk> American fragmentation and concussion grenades , and some American rations . 
 Meanwhile , during these actions in its rear , the 1st Battalion , 23rd Infantry , was cut off 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) west of the nearest friendly units . On September 1 the regiment ordered it to withdraw to the <unk> area . At 14 : 00 a tank @-@ infantry patrol was sent down the road , but it reported that an estimated North Korean battalion held the mountain pass just eastward of the battalion 's defense perimeter . Upon receiving this report the battalion commander requested permission by radio to remain in his present position and try to obstruct the movement of North Korean reinforcements and supplies . That evening Freeman approved this request , and 1st Battalion spent three days in the isolated positions . During this time C @-@ 47 <unk> planes supplied the battalion by <unk> . 
 On the morning of September 1 , 3rd Battalion , 38th Infantry moved in an attack westward from the 23rd Regiment command post near <unk> @-@ <unk> to open the road to the 1st Battalion . On the second day of the fighting at the pass , the relief force broke through the roadblock with the help of air strikes and artillery and tank fire . The advanced elements of the battalion joined 1st Battalion at 17 : 00 September 2 . That evening , North Koreans strongly attacked the 3rd Battalion , 38th Infantry , on Hill <unk> north of the road and opposite 1st Battalion , driving one company from its position . 
 On September 4 , Haynes changed the boundary between the 38th and 23rd Infantry Regiments , giving the northern part of the 23rd 's sector to the 38th Infantry , thus releasing 1st Battalion for movement southward to help the 2nd Battalion defend the southern approach to <unk> . The 1st Battalion , 23rd Infantry , about 1 @,@ 100 men strong when the attack began , was now down to a strength of approximately 600 men . The 23rd Infantry now made plans to concentrate all its troops on the position held by its 2nd Battalion on the <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> road . The 1st Battalion moved there and took a place on the left flank of the 2nd Battalion . At the same time the regimental command post moved to the rear of this position . In this regimental perimeter , the 23rd Infantry fought a series of hard battles . Simultaneously it had to send combat patrols to its rear to clear infiltrating North Koreans from <unk> and from its supply road . 
 On the morning of September 1 the 1st and 2nd Regiments of the <unk> 9th Division , in their first offensive of the war , stood only a few miles short of <unk> after a successful river crossing and penetration of the American line . The 3rd Regiment had been left at <unk> <unk> , but division commander Major General <unk> <unk> Sam felt the chances of capturing <unk> were strong . 
 On the morning of September 1 , with only the shattered remnants of E Company at hand , the US 9th Infantry Regiment , US 2nd Infantry Division had virtually no troops to defend <unk> . <unk> in this emergency attached the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion to the regiment . The US 72nd Tank Battalion and the 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company also were assigned positions close to <unk> . The regimental commander planned to place the engineers on the chain of low hills that arched around <unk> on the northwest . 
 A Company , 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion , moved to the south side of the <unk> @-@ <unk> River road ; D Company of the 2nd Engineer Battalion was on the north side of the road . Approximately 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) west of <unk> an estimated 300 North Korean troops engaged A Company in a fire fight . <unk> Gun Motor <unk> of the 82nd AAA Battalion supported the engineers in this action , which lasted several hours . Meanwhile , with the approval of General Bradley , D Company moved to the hill immediately south of and overlooking <unk> . A platoon of infantry went into position behind it . A Company was now ordered to fall back to the southeast edge of <unk> on the left flank of D Company . There , A Company went into position along the road ; on its left was C Company of the Engineer battalion , and beyond C Company was the 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company . The hill occupied by D Company was in reality the western tip of a large mountain mass that lay southeast of the town . The road to <unk> came south out of <unk> , bent around the western tip of this mountain , and then ran eastward along its southern base . In its position , D Company not only commanded the town but also its exit , the road to <unk> . 
 North Koreans had also approached <unk> from the south . The US 2nd Division Reconnaissance Company and tanks of the 72nd Tank Battalion opposed them in a sharp fight . In this action , Sergeant First Class Charles W. Turner of the Reconnaissance Company particularly distinguished himself . He mounted a tank , operated its exposed turret machine gun , and directed tank fire which reportedly destroyed seven North Korean machine guns . Turner and this tank came under heavy North Korean fire which shot away the tank 's <unk> and <unk> and scored more than 50 hits on it . Turner , although wounded , remained on the tank until he was killed . That night North Korean soldiers crossed the low ground around <unk> and entered the town from the south . 
 At 09 : 35 September 2 , while the North Koreans were attempting to destroy the engineer troops at the southern edge of <unk> and clear the road to <unk> , Walker spoke by telephone with Major General Doyle O. <unk> , Deputy Chief of Staff , Far East Command in Tokyo . He described the situation around the Perimeter and said the most serious threat was along the boundary between the US 2nd and US 25th Infantry Divisions . He described the location of his reserve forces and his plans for using them . He said he had started the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade toward <unk> but had not yet released them for commitment there and he wanted to be sure that General of the Army Douglas MacArthur approved his use of them , since he knew that this would interfere with other plans of the Far East Command . Walker said he did not think he could restore the 2nd Division lines without using them . <unk> replied that MacArthur had the day before approved the use of the US Marines if and when Walker considered it necessary . A few hours after this conversation Walker , at 13 : 15 , attached the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to the US 2nd Division and ordered a co @-@ ordinated attack by all available elements of the division and the marines , with the mission of destroying the North Koreans east of the <unk> River in the 2nd Division sector and of restoring the river line . The marines were to be released from 2nd Division control as soon as this mission was accomplished . 
 A decision was reached that the marines would attack west at 08 : 00 on September 3 <unk> the <unk> @-@ <unk> River road ; the 9th Infantry , B Company of the 72nd Tank Battalion , and D Battery of the <unk> AAA Battalion would attack northwest above the marines and attempt to re @-@ establish contact with the US 23rd Infantry ; the 2nd Engineer Combat Battalion , remnants of the 1st Battalion , 9th Infantry , and elements of the 72nd Tank Battalion would attack on the left flank , or south , of the marines to reestablish contact with the 25th Division . Eighth Army now ordered the US 24th Infantry Division headquarters and the US 19th Infantry Regiment to move to the Susan @-@ <unk> area , 8 miles ( 13 km ) south of <unk> and 15 miles ( 24 km ) east of the confluence of the <unk> River and the <unk> River . There it was to prepare to enter the battle in either the 2nd or 25th Division zone . 
 The American counteroffensive of September 3 – 5 west of <unk> , according to prisoner statements , resulted in one of the <unk> <unk> of the war for a North Korean division . Even though remnants of the <unk> 9th Division , supported by the low strength <unk> 4th Division , still held <unk> @-@ <unk> Ridge , <unk> Hill , and the intervening ground back to the <unk> on September 6 , the division 's offensive strength had been spent at the end of the American counterattack . The <unk> 9th and 4th divisions were not able to resume the offensive . 
 The <unk> 2nd Division made a new effort against the 23rd Infantry 's perimeter in the <unk> hours of September 8 , in an attempt to break through eastward . This attack , launched at 02 : 30 and heavily supported with artillery , penetrated F Company . It was apparent that unless F Company 's position could be restored the entire regimental front would collapse . When all its officers became casualties , First Lieutenant Ralph R. Robinson , adjutant of the 2nd Battalion , assumed command of the company . With North Koreans rapidly infiltrating his company 's position and gaining its rear , Robinson in the darkness made his way through them 500 yards ( 460 m ) to A Company 's position . There he obtained that company 's reserve platoon and brought it back to F Company . He accomplished the dangerous and difficult task of <unk> it into the gap in F Company 's lines in darkness and heavy rain . 
 The attack tapered off with the coming of daylight , but that night it resumed . The North Koreans struck repeatedly at the defense line . This time they continued the fighting into the daylight hours of 9 September . The Air Force then concentrated strong air support over the regimental perimeter to aid the ground troops . Casualties came to the aid stations from the infantry companies in an almost steady stream during the morning . All available men from Headquarters Company and special units were formed into squads and put into the fight at the most critical points . At one time , the regimental reserve was down to six men . When the attack finally ceased shortly after 12 : 00 the 23rd Regiment had an estimated combat efficiency of only 38 percent . 
 This heavy night and day battle cost the <unk> 2nd Division most of its remaining offensive strength . The medical officer of the <unk> 17th Regiment , 2nd Division , captured a few days later , said that the division evacuated about 300 men nightly to a hospital in <unk> @-@ <unk> , and that in the first two weeks of September the 2nd Division lost 1 @,@ 300 killed and 2 @,@ 500 wounded in the fighting west of <unk> . Even though its offensive strength was largely spent by September 9 , the division continued to harass rear areas around <unk> with infiltrating groups as large as companies . <unk> daily had to open the main supply road and clear the town . 
 North Korean and US troops remained locked in combat along the <unk> River for several more days . The North Koreans ' offensive capability was largely destroyed , and the US troops resolved to hold their lines barring further attack . 
 The UN counterattack at <unk> collapsed the North Korean line and cut off all their main supply and reinforcement routes . On September 19 the UN discovered the North Koreans had abandoned much of the Pusan Perimeter during the night , and the UN units began advancing out of their defensive positions and occupying them . Most of the North Korean units began conducting delaying actions attempting to get as much of their army as possible into North Korea . The North Koreans withdrew from the <unk> area first , the night of September 18 – 19 . After the forces there , the remainder of the North Korean armies withdrew rapidly to the North . The US units rapidly pursued them north , passing over the <unk> River positions , which were no longer of strategic importance . 
 The North Korean 2nd and 9th Divisions were almost completely destroyed in the battles . The 9th Division had numbered 9 @,@ 350 men at the beginning of the offensive on September 1 . The 2nd Division numbered 6 @,@ 000 . Only a few hundred from each division returned to North Korea after the fight . The majority of the North Korean troops had been killed , captured or deserted . All of <unk> II Corps was in a similar state , and the North Korean army , exhausted at Pusan Perimeter and cut off after <unk> , was on the brink of defeat . 
 By this time , the US 2nd Infantry Division suffered 1 @,@ 120 killed , 2 @,@ <unk> wounded , 67 captured and 69 missing during its time at Pusan Perimeter . This included about 180 casualties it suffered during the First Battle of <unk> <unk> the previous month . American forces were continually repulsed but able to prevent the North Koreans from breaking the Pusan Perimeter . The division had numbered 17 @,@ <unk> on September 1 , but was in excellent position to attack despite its casualties . The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade suffered 185 killed and around 500 wounded during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter , most of which probably occurred at <unk> . 
 Of all the North Korean attacks along the Pusan Perimeter , the Second Battle of <unk> <unk> is seen by historians as the most serious threat . It was the battle in which the North Koreans made the most substantial gains , splitting the US 2nd Infantry Division in half and briefly capturing <unk> , where they were very close to breaching through to the US forces ' supply lines and threatening other divisions ' rear areas . However , once again the fatal weakness of the North Korean Army had cost it victory after an impressive initial success — its communications and supply were not capable of <unk> a breakthrough and of supporting a continuing attack in the face of massive air , armor , and artillery fire that could be concentrated against its troops at critical points . By September 8 , the North Korean attacks in the area had been repulsed . 
 <unk> <unk> , also known as ( <unk> ) Planet Earth and stylized as ( <unk> ) <unk> , is an American rock band from Huntington Beach , California . Formed in 1994 , the band performs a style of music which it refers to as " G @-@ punk " , a fusion of punk rock and <unk> rap . 
 After releasing three albums on <unk> Records , <unk> <unk> left the label to record independently , eventually signing with <unk> <unk> Records in 2006 . Since 2006 , the band has become known for its involvement in the 9 / 11 Truth movement , referencing it in many of their song lyrics and concerts , as well as the concept of the album New World <unk> . To date , they have released nine studio albums , one live album and two compilation albums . 
 <unk> <unk> signed with <unk> Records , releasing their self @-@ titled debut album in 1997 . In his review of the album , Allmusic 's Steve Huey wrote " There are some slow and / or <unk> moments [ ... ] but overall , its aggression will probably play well with <unk> ' 90s metal and punk fans . " Due to the label 's contractual terms and the disappointing sales of the album , the band found themselves unable to <unk> the cash advances given to them by <unk> . <unk> is quoted as saying " We had these romantic visions of the music industry , and we thought it would be cool to be a punk band on a rap label . So we fulfilled that dream , but it was also probably the worst thing that could have happened . [ ... ] We 've had offers from Sony and others that we can 't take because we owe <unk> so much money . " 
 On October 27 , 2000 , <unk> was arrested for possession of marijuana while the band was performing in <unk> , Connecticut . He was released on a US $ 1 @,@ 500 bond . In 2001 , <unk> <unk> performed on the <unk> tour alongside bands such as Korn , Static @-@ X , and System of a Down . A music video for " Killing Time " , the second single from <unk> , was produced in promotion of the film 3000 Miles to <unk> , which featured the song on its soundtrack . 
 <unk> <unk> released their third studio album , <unk> , on March 18 , 2003 . It peaked at No. 33 on the Billboard 200 , while its title track peaked at No. 21 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and at No. 32 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart . Allmusic 's Johnny <unk> wrote that " While it expands on melodic elements that had previously played a supporting role in the band 's sound , <unk> also delivers <unk> of crushing guitar and pounding rhythm . And whether or not it is the presence of a top @-@ line producer , ( <unk> ) <unk> have figured out a way to <unk> their aggressive mix of heavy rock and hip @-@ hop with some serious hooks . " Guitarist <unk> joined the band in early 2004 . He is the fourth person to fill this position . 
 On May 13 , 2014 , On the band 's official Facebook page , they released the official announcement of when the band 's new album Evolution will hit stores . The album is set for release July 22 , 2014 . They also released a teaser of the tone of the new album on their Facebook page and soon after , the track " One More Body " . 
 In 2015 , it was confirmed that 12 @-@ year guitarist <unk> <unk> and original bassist Mark Young had left the band . They were replaced by guitarist Greg " <unk> " Harrison and bassist Kurt <unk> , leaving vocalist and founding member <unk> <unk> as the group 's only remaining original talent . 
 <unk> <unk> performs a style of music which they have referred to as " G @-@ punk " , a phrase inspired by the term " G @-@ funk " , itself a reference to the P @-@ <unk> collective . <unk> <unk> 's music is a fusion of styles ranging from hip hop , reggae , and <unk> to hard rock , punk , and heavy metal . Other elements that have been incorporated into this style include blues , funk , jazz and industrial . <unk> <unk> ' vocal style ranges from melodic singing to rapping , screaming , and death <unk> . The band 's lyrics draw from a number of subjects , including the existence of extraterrestrial life , criticism of organized religion , the 9 / 11 Truth movement , cannabis use and sexual intercourse . 
 <unk> , in addition to the 9 / 11 Truth movement , has expressed support for social liberal politicians such as Nancy <unk> and president Barack Obama . Previously however , <unk> ' 2004 lyrics for Only in <unk> expressed support for nationalism , and called for retaliation against Al <unk> for the 9 / 11 terrorist attacks . 
 An ironclad is a steam @-@ propelled warship protected by iron or steel armor plates used in the early part of the second half of the 19th century . The ironclad was developed as a result of the vulnerability of wooden warships to explosive or incendiary shells . The first ironclad battleship , Gloire , was launched by the French Navy in November 1859 . The British Admiralty had been considering armored warships since 1856 and prepared a draft design for an armored <unk> in 1857 ; in early 1859 the Royal Navy started building two iron @-@ <unk> armored frigates , and by 1861 had made the decision to move to an all @-@ armored battle fleet . After the first clashes of ironclads ( both with wooden ships and with one another ) took place in 1862 during the American Civil War , it became clear that the ironclad had replaced the <unk> ship of the line as the most powerful warship afloat . This type of ship would come to be very successful in the American Civil War . 
 <unk> were designed for several roles , including as high seas battleships , coastal defense ships , and long @-@ range cruisers . The rapid evolution of warship design in the late 19th century transformed the ironclad from a wooden @-@ <unk> vessel that carried sails to supplement its steam engines into the steel @-@ built , <unk> battleships and cruisers familiar in the 20th century . This change was pushed forward by the development of heavier naval guns ( the ironclads of the 1880s carried some of the heaviest guns ever mounted at sea ) , more sophisticated steam engines , and advances in metallurgy which made steel shipbuilding possible . 
 The quick pace of change meant that many ships were obsolete as soon as they were finished , and that naval tactics were in a state of flux . Many ironclads were built to make use of the ram or the torpedo , which a number of naval designers considered the important weapons of naval combat . There is no clear end to the ironclad period , but towards the end of the 1890s the term ironclad dropped out of use . New ships were increasingly constructed to a standard pattern and designated battleships or armored cruisers . 
 The ironclad became technically feasible and tactically necessary because of developments in shipbuilding in the first half of the 19th century . According to naval historian J. Richard Hill : " The ( ironclad ) had three chief characteristics : a metal @-@ skinned hull , steam propulsion and a main armament of guns capable of firing explosive shells . It is only when all three characteristics are present that a fighting ship can properly be called an ironclad . " Each of these developments was introduced separately in the decade before the first ironclads . 
 In the 18th and early 19th centuries fleets had relied on two types of major warship , the ship of the line and the frigate . The first major change to these types was the introduction of steam power for propulsion . While <unk> steamer warships had been used from the 1830s onwards , steam propulsion only became suitable for major warships after the adoption of the screw propeller in the 1840s . 
 Steam @-@ powered screw frigates were built in the mid @-@ 1840s , and at the end of the decade the French Navy introduced steam power to its line of battle . The desire for change came from the ambition of Napoleon III to gain greater influence in Europe , which required a challenge to the British at sea . The first purpose @-@ built steam battleship was the 90 @-@ gun Napoléon in 1850 . Napoléon was armed as a conventional ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line , but her steam engines could give her a speed of 12 knots ( 22 km / h ) , regardless of the wind conditions : a potentially decisive advantage in a naval engagement . 
 The introduction of the steam ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line led to a building competition between France and Britain . Eight sister ships to Napoléon were built in France over a period of ten years , but the United Kingdom soon managed to take the lead in production . <unk> , France built ten new wooden steam battleships and converted 28 from older ships of the line , while the United Kingdom built 18 and converted 41 . 
 The era of the wooden steam ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line was brief , because of new , more powerful naval guns . In the 1820s and 1830s , warships began to mount increasingly heavy guns , replacing 18- and 24 @-@ pounder guns with 32 @-@ pounders on sailing ships @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line and introducing 68 @-@ pounders on <unk> . Then , the first shell guns firing explosive shells were introduced following their development by the French <unk> Henri @-@ Joseph <unk> , and by the 1840s were part of the standard armament for naval powers including the French Navy , Royal Navy , Imperial Russian Navy and United States Navy . It is often held that the power of explosive shells to smash wooden hulls , as demonstrated by the Russian destruction of an Ottoman squadron at the Battle of <unk> , spelled the end of the wooden @-@ <unk> warship . The more practical threat to wooden ships was from conventional cannon firing red @-@ hot shot , which could <unk> in the hull of a wooden ship and cause a fire or ammunition explosion . Some navies even experimented with hollow shot filled with molten metal for extra incendiary power . 
 The use of iron instead of wood as the primary material of ships ' hulls began in the 1830s ; the first " warship " with an iron hull was the gunboat <unk> , built by Laird for the East India Company in 1839 . There followed , also from Laird , the first full @-@ blown warships with metal hulls , the 1842 steam frigates <unk> and <unk> for the Mexican navy . But a thin iron skin , while not being susceptible to fire or lethal <unk> like wood , was not the same thing as providing iron armor calculated to stop enemy gunfire . 
 Following the demonstration of the power of explosive shells against wooden ships at the Battle of <unk> , and fearing that his own ships would be vulnerable to the <unk> guns of Russian fortifications in the Crimean War , Emperor Napoleon III ordered the development of light @-@ draft floating batteries , equipped with heavy guns and protected by heavy armor . Experiments made during the first half of 1854 proved highly satisfactory , and on 17 July 1854 , the French communicated to the British Government that a solution had been found to make gun @-@ proof vessels and that plans would be communicated . After tests in September 1854 , the British Admiralty agreed to build five armoured floating batteries on the French plans , establishing the important Thames and <unk> Iron Works within the docks . 
 The French floating batteries were deployed in 1855 as a supplement to the wooden steam battle fleet in the Crimean War . The role of the battery was to assist <unk> mortar and gunboats bombarding shore fortifications . The French used three of their ironclad batteries ( <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ) in 1855 against the defenses at the Battle of <unk> on the Black Sea , where they were effective against Russian shore defences . They would later be used again during the Italian war in the Adriatic in 1859 . The British floating batteries <unk> and Meteor arrived too late to participate to the action at <unk> . The British planned to use theirs in the Baltic Sea against the well @-@ fortified naval base at <unk> . 
 The batteries have a claim to the title of the first ironclad warships but they were capable of only 4 knots ( 7 km / h ) under their own power : they operated under their own power at the Battle of <unk> , but had to be towed for long range transit . They were also arguably marginal to the work of the navy . The brief success of the floating ironclad batteries convinced France to begin work on armored warships for their <unk> . 
 By the end of the 1850s it was clear that France was unable to match British building of steam warships , and to regain the strategic initiative a dramatic change was required . The result was the first ocean @-@ going ironclad , the Gloire , begun in 1857 and launched in 1859 . 
 Gloire 's wooden hull was modelled on that of a steam ship of the line , reduced to one deck , <unk> in iron plates 4 @.@ 5 inches ( 110 mm ) thick . She was propelled by a steam engine , driving a single screw propeller for a speed of 13 knots ( 24 km / h ) . She was armed with thirty @-@ six 6 @.@ 4 @-@ inch ( 160 mm ) rifled guns . France proceeded to construct 16 ironclad warships , including two more sister ships to Gloire , and the only two @-@ <unk> broadside ironclads ever built , <unk> and <unk> . 
 The Royal Navy had not been keen to sacrifice its advantage in steam ships of the line , but was determined that the first British ironclad would <unk> the French ships in every respect , particularly speed . A fast ship would have the advantage of being able to choose a range of engagement which could make her <unk> to enemy fire . The British specification was more a large , powerful frigate than a ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line . The requirement for speed meant a very long vessel , which had to be built from iron . The result was the construction of two Warrior @-@ class ironclads ; HMS Warrior and HMS Black Prince . The ships had a successful design , though there were necessarily compromises between ' sea @-@ keeping ' , strategic range and armour protection ; their weapons were more effective than that of Gloire , and with the largest set of steam engines yet fitted to a ship they could steam at 14 @.@ 3 knots ( 26 @.@ 5 km / h ) . Yet the Gloire and her sisters had full iron @-@ armour protection along the waterline and the battery itself . Warrior and Black Prince ( but also the smaller Defence and Resistance ) were obliged to concentrate their armour in a central ' citadel ' or ' armoured box ' , leaving many main deck guns and the fore and aft sections of the vessel unprotected . The use of iron in the construction of Warrior also came with some drawbacks ; iron hulls required more regular and intensive repairs than wooden hulls , and iron was more susceptible to <unk> by marine life . 
 By 1862 , navies across Europe had adopted ironclads . Britain and France each had sixteen either completed or under construction , though the British vessels were larger . Austria , Italy , Russia , and Spain were also building ironclads . However , the first battles using the new ironclad ships involved neither Britain nor France , and involved ships markedly different from the broadside @-@ firing , <unk> designs of Gloire and Warrior . The use of ironclads by both sides in the American Civil War , and the clash of the Italian and Austrian fleets at the Battle of <unk> , had an important influence on the development of ironclad design . 
 The first use of ironclads in action came in the U.S. Civil War . The U.S. Navy at the time the war broke out had no ironclads , its most powerful ships being six steam @-@ powered <unk> frigates . Since the bulk of the Navy remained loyal to the Union , the Confederacy sought to gain advantage in the naval conflict by acquiring modern armored ships . In May 1861 , the Confederate Congress voted that $ 2 million be appropriated for the purchase of ironclads from overseas , and in July and August 1861 the Confederacy started work on construction and converting wooden ships . 
 On 12 October 1861 , the CSS <unk> became the first ironclad to enter combat , when she fought Union warships on the Mississippi during the Battle of the Head of <unk> . She had been converted from a commercial vessel in New Orleans for river and coastal fighting . In February 1862 , the larger CSS Virginia joined the Confederate Navy , having been rebuilt at Norfolk . <unk> on the hull of USS <unk> , Virginia originally was a conventional warship made of wood , but she was converted into an iron @-@ covered casemate ironclad <unk> , when she entered the Confederate navy . By this time , the Union had completed seven ironclad gunboats of the City class , and was about to complete the USS <unk> , an innovative design proposed by the Swedish inventor John Ericsson . The Union was also building a large armored frigate , the USS New <unk> , and the smaller USS <unk> . 
 The first battle between ironclads happened on 9 March 1862 , as the armored <unk> was deployed to protect the Union 's wooden fleet from the ironclad ram Virginia and other Confederate warships . In this engagement , the second day of the Battle of Hampton Roads , the two ironclads repeatedly tried to ram one another while shells bounced off their armor . The battle attracted attention worldwide , making it clear that the wooden warship was now out of date , with the ironclads destroying them easily . 
 The Civil War saw more ironclads built by both sides , and they played an increasing role in the naval war alongside the <unk> warships , commerce raiders and blockade runners . The Union built a large fleet of fifty monitors modeled on their namesake . The Confederacy built ships designed as smaller versions of the Virginia , many of which saw action , but their attempts to buy ironclads overseas were frustrated as European nations confiscated ships being built for the Confederacy — especially in Russia , the only country to openly support the Union through the war . Only CSS <unk> was completed , and she arrived in American waters just in time for the end of the war . 
 Through the remainder of the war , ironclads saw action in the Union 's attacks on Confederate ports . Seven Union monitors , including USS <unk> , as well as two other ironclads , the ironclad frigate New <unk> and a light @-@ draft USS <unk> , participated in the failed attack on Charleston ; one was sunk . Two small ironclads , CSS <unk> State and CSS <unk> participated in the defence of the harbor . For the later attack at Mobile Bay , the Union assembled four monitors as well as 11 wooden ships , facing the CSS Tennessee , the Confederacy 's most powerful ironclad and the gunboats CSS Morgan , CSS Gaines , CSS Selma . 
 On the western front , the Union built a formidable force of river ironclads , beginning with several converted <unk> and then contracting engineer James <unk> of St. Louis , Missouri to build the City @-@ class ironclads . These excellent ships were built with twin engines and a central <unk> wheel , all protected by an armored <unk> . They had a shallow draft , allowing them to journey up smaller tributaries , and were very well suited for river operations . <unk> also produced monitors for use on the rivers , the first two of which differed from the ocean @-@ going monitors in that they contained a <unk> wheel ( the USS <unk> and USS Osage ) . 
 <unk> <unk> vessels were some of the better ironclads of the Western Flotilla , but there were a number of other vessels that served <unk> with the fleet . All were of varying design , some more successful than others , and some were similar to standard <unk> but with armored side @-@ mounted <unk> wheels . All were armed with various smoothbore and some rifled guns . If nothing else the experience of the American Civil War and its wild variety of competing ironclad designs , some more successful ( or disastrous ) than others , confirmed the emerging trade @-@ off or compromises required in applying the latest technological advances in iron armour manufacture , ship construction and gun design — to name a few — also going on in Europe . There was no such thing as a ' perfect ' ironclad which could be <unk> in every possible encounter ; ship duels , standing up to forts , Brown & Blue @-@ water operations . 
 The Union ironclads played an important role in the Mississippi and tributaries by providing tremendous fire upon Confederate forts , installations and vessels with relative <unk> to enemy fire . They were not as heavily armored as the ocean @-@ going monitors of the Union , but they were adequate for their intended use . More Western Flotilla Union ironclads were sunk by torpedoes ( mines ) than by enemy fire , and the most damaging fire for the Union ironclads was from shore installations , not Confederate vessels . 
 The first fleet battle , and the first ocean battle , involving ironclad warships was the Battle of <unk> in 1866 . <unk> between the Austrian and Italian navies , the battle pitted combined fleets of wooden frigates and <unk> and ironclad warships on both sides in the largest naval battle between the battles of <unk> and <unk> . 
 The Italian fleet consisted of 12 ironclads and a similar number of wooden warships , escorting transports which carried troops intending to land on the Adriatic island of <unk> . Among the Italian ironclads were seven broadside ironclad frigates , four smaller ironclads , and the newly built <unk> — a double @-@ <unk> ram . <unk> them , the Austrian navy had seven ironclad frigates . 
 The Austrians believed their ships to have less effective guns than their enemy , so decided to engage the Italians at close range and ram them . The Austrian fleet formed into an <unk> formation with the ironclads in the first line , charging at the Italian ironclad squadron . In the <unk> which followed both sides were frustrated by the lack of damage inflicted by guns , and by the difficulty of <unk> — nonetheless , the effective <unk> attack being made by the Austrian flagship against the Italian attracted great attention in following years . 
 The superior Italian fleet lost its two ironclads , Re d 'Italia and Palestro , while the Austrian <unk> screw two @-@ <unk> SMS Kaiser remarkably survived close actions with four Italian ironclads . The battle ensured the popularity of the ram as a weapon in European ironclads for many years , and the victory won by Austria established it as the predominant naval power in the Adriatic . 
 The battles of the American Civil War and at <unk> were very influential on the designs and tactics of the ironclad fleets that followed . In particular , it taught a generation of naval officers the misleading lesson that <unk> was the best way to sink enemy ironclads . 
 The adoption of iron armor meant that the traditional naval armament of dozens of light cannon became useless , since their shot would bounce off an armored hull . To penetrate armor , increasingly heavy guns were mounted on ships ; nevertheless , the view that <unk> was the only way to sink an ironclad became widespread . The increasing size and weight of guns also meant a movement away from the ships mounting many guns broadside , in the manner of a ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line , towards a handful of guns in turrets for all @-@ round fire . 
 From the 1860s to the 1880s many naval designers believed that the development of the ironclad meant that the ram was again the most important weapon in naval warfare . With steam power freeing ships from the wind , and armor making them <unk> to <unk> , the ram seemed to offer the opportunity to strike a decisive blow . 
 The <unk> damage inflicted by the guns of <unk> and Virginia at Battle of Hampton Roads and the spectacular but lucky success of the Austrian flagship SMS Erzherzog Ferdinand Max sinking the Italian Re d 'Italia at <unk> gave strength to the <unk> craze . From the early 1870s to early 1880s most British naval officers thought that guns were about to be replaced as the main naval armament by the ram . Those who noted the tiny number of ships that had actually been sunk by <unk> struggled to be heard . 
 The revival of <unk> had a significant effect on naval tactics . Since the 17th century the predominant tactic of naval warfare had been the line of battle , where a fleet formed a long line to give it the best fire from its broadside guns . This tactic was totally unsuited to <unk> , and the ram threw fleet tactics into <unk> . The question of how an ironclad fleet should deploy in battle to make best use of the ram was never tested in battle , and if it had been , combat might have shown that rams could only be used against ships which were already stopped dead in the water . 
 The ram finally fell out of favour in the 1880s , as the same effect could be achieved with a torpedo , with less vulnerability to quick @-@ firing guns . 
 The armament of ironclads tended to become concentrated in a small number of powerful guns capable of penetrating the armor of enemy ships at range ; calibre and weight of guns increased markedly to achieve greater penetration . Throughout the ironclad era navies also <unk> with the <unk> of rifled versus smoothbore guns and breech @-@ loading versus muzzle @-@ loading . 
 HMS Warrior carried a mixture of 110 @-@ pounder 7 inch ( 180 mm ) breech @-@ loading rifles and more traditional 68 @-@ pounder smoothbore guns . Warrior highlighted the challenges of picking the right armament ; the breech @-@ <unk> she carried , designed by Sir William Armstrong , were intended to be the next generation of heavy armament for the Royal Navy , but were shortly withdrawn from service . 
 <unk> @-@ loading guns seemed to offer important advantages . A breech @-@ <unk> could be <unk> without moving the gun , a lengthy process particularly if the gun then needed to be re @-@ aimed . The Warrior 's Armstrong guns also had the virtue of being lighter than an equivalent smoothbore and , because of their <unk> , more accurate . Nonetheless , the design was rejected because of problems which plagued breech @-@ <unk> for decades . 
 The weakness of the breech @-@ <unk> was the obvious problem of sealing the breech . All guns are powered by the explosive conversion of gunpowder into gas . This explosion <unk> the shot or shell out of the front of the gun , but also <unk> great stresses on the gun @-@ barrel . If the breech — which experiences some of the greatest forces in the gun — is not entirely secure , then there is a risk that either gas will discharge through the breech or that the breech will break . This in turn reduces the muzzle velocity of the weapon and can also endanger the gun crew . The Warrior 's Armstrong guns suffered from both problems ; the shells were unable to penetrate the 4 @.@ 5 in ( 118 mm ) armor of Gloire , while sometimes the screw which closed the breech flew backwards out of the gun on firing . Similar problems were experienced with the breech @-@ loading guns which became standard in the French and German navies . 
 These problems influenced the British to equip ships with muzzle @-@ loading weapons of increasing power until the 1880s . After a brief introduction of 100 @-@ pounder or 9 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 240 mm ) smoothbore Somerset Gun , which weighed 6 @.@ 5 tons ( 6 @.@ 6 t ) , the Admiralty introduced 7 @-@ inch ( 178 mm ) rifled guns , weighing 7 tons . These were followed by a series of increasingly <unk> weapons — guns weighing 12 , 25 , 25 , 38 and finally 81 tons , with calibre increasing from 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) to 16 @-@ inch ( 406 mm ) . 
 The decision to retain muzzle @-@ <unk> until the 1880s has been criticised by historians . However , at least until the late 1870s , the British muzzle @-@ <unk> had superior performance in terms of both range and rate of fire than the French and Prussian breech @-@ <unk> , which suffered from the same problems as had the first Armstrong guns . 
 From 1875 onwards , the balance between <unk> and muzzle @-@ loading changed . Captain de <unk> invented a method of reliably sealing a breech , adopted by the French in 1873 . Just as <unk> , the growing size of naval guns made muzzle @-@ loading much more complicated . With guns of such size there was no prospect of <unk> in the gun for re @-@ loading , or even re @-@ loading by hand , and complicated hydraulic systems were required for re @-@ loading the gun outside the turret without exposing the crew to enemy fire . In 1882 , the 81 @-@ ton , 16 @-@ inch ( 406 mm ) guns of HMS <unk> fired only once every 11 minutes while bombarding Alexandria during the <unk> <unk> . The 100 @-@ ton , 450 mm ( 17 @.@ 72 inch ) guns of <unk> <unk> could each fire a round every 15 minutes . 
 In the Royal Navy , the switch to breech @-@ <unk> was finally made in 1879 ; as well as the significant advantages in terms of performance , opinion was <unk> by an explosion on board HMS <unk> caused by a gun being double @-@ loaded , a problem which could only happen with a muzzle @-@ loading gun . 
 The calibre and weight of guns could only increase so far . The larger the gun , the slower it would be to load , the greater the stresses on the ship 's hull , and the less the stability of the ship . The size of the gun peaked in the 1880s , with some of the heaviest <unk> of gun ever used at sea . HMS <unk> carried two 16 @.@ 25 @-@ inch ( <unk> mm ) breech @-@ loading guns , each weighing 110 tons — no British battleship would ever carry guns as large . The Italian 450 mm ( 17 @.@ 72 inch ) guns would be larger than any gun fitted to a battleship until the 18 @.@ 1 @-@ inch ( 460 mm ) armament of the Japanese Yamato class of World War II . One consideration which became more acute was that even from the original Armstrong models , following the Crimean War , range and hitting power far exceeded simple accuracy , especially at sea where the slightest roll or pitch of the vessel as ' floating weapons @-@ platform ' could <unk> the advantage of <unk> . American ordnance experts accordingly preferred smoothbore monsters whose round shot could at least ' <unk> ' along the surface of the water . <unk> effective combat ranges , they had learned during the Civil War , were comparable to those in the Age of <unk> — though a vessel could now be smashed to pieces in only a few rounds . Smoke and the general chaos of battle only added to the problem . As a result , many naval engagements in the ' Age of the <unk> ' were still fought at ranges within easy eyesight of their targets , and well below the maximum reach of their ships ' guns . 
 Another method of increasing firepower was to vary the <unk> fired or the nature of the propellant . Early ironclads used black powder , which expanded rapidly after combustion ; this meant cannons had relatively short barrels , to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell . The <unk> of the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress . One important step was to press the powder into <unk> , allowing a slower , more controlled explosion and a longer barrel . A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown powder which <unk> more slowly again . It also put less stress on the <unk> of the barrel , allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to <unk> <unk> . 
 The development of <unk> powder , based on <unk> or <unk> , by the French inventor Paul <unk> in 1884 was a further step allowing smaller charges of propellant with longer barrels . The guns of the pre @-@ <unk> battleships of the 1890s tended to be smaller in calibre compared to the ships of the 1880s , most often 12 in ( 305 mm ) , but progressively grew in length of barrel , making use of improved <unk> to gain greater muzzle velocity . 
 The nature of the projectiles also changed during the ironclad period . Initially , the best armor @-@ piercing <unk> was a solid cast @-@ iron shot . Later , shot of <unk> iron , a harder iron alloy , gave better armor @-@ piercing qualities . Eventually the armor @-@ piercing shell was developed . 
 The first British , French and Russian ironclads , in a logical development of warship design from the long preceding era of wooden ships of the line , carried their weapons in a single line along their sides and so were called " broadside ironclads . " Both Gloire and HMS Warrior were examples of this type . Because their armor was so heavy , they could only carry a single row of guns along the main deck on each side rather than a row on each deck . 
 A significant number of broadside ironclads were built in the 1860s , principally in Britain and France , but in smaller numbers by other powers including Italy , Austria , Russia and the United States . The advantages of mounting guns on both broadsides was that the ship could engage more than one <unk> at a time , and the rigging did not impede the field of fire . 
 <unk> armament also had disadvantages , which became more serious as ironclad technology developed . <unk> guns to penetrate ever @-@ thicker armor meant that fewer guns could be carried . Furthermore , the adoption of <unk> as an important tactic meant the need for ahead and all @-@ round fire . These problems led to broadside designs being superseded by designs that gave greater all @-@ round fire , which included central @-@ battery , turret , and barbette designs . 
 There were two main design <unk> to the broadside . In one design , the guns were placed in an armoured casemate amidships : this arrangement was called the ' box @-@ battery ' or ' centre @-@ battery ' . In the other , the guns could be placed on a rotating platform to give them a broad field of fire ; when fully armored , this arrangement was called a turret and when partially armored or <unk> , a barbette . 
 The centre @-@ battery was the simpler and , during the 1860s and 1870s , the more popular method . <unk> guns amidships meant the ship could be shorter and <unk> than a broadside type . The first full @-@ scale centre @-@ battery ship was HMS Bellerophon of 1865 ; the French laid down centre @-@ battery ironclads in 1865 which were not completed until 1870 . Centre @-@ battery ships often , but not always , had a <unk> <unk> enabling some of their guns to fire directly ahead . 
 A lighter alternative to the turret , particularly popular with the French navy , was the barbette . These were fixed armored towers which held a gun on a <unk> . The crew was sheltered from direct fire , but vulnerable to <unk> fire , for instance from shore emplacements . The barbette was lighter than the turret , needing less machinery and no roof armor — though nevertheless some barbettes were stripped of their armor plate to reduce the top @-@ weight of their ships . The barbette became widely adopted in the 1880s , and with the addition of an armored ' gun @-@ house ' , transformed into the turrets of the pre @-@ <unk> battleships . 
 The ironclad age saw the development of explosive torpedoes as naval weapons , which helped <unk> the design and tactics of ironclad fleets . The first torpedoes were static mines , used extensively in the American Civil War . That conflict also saw the development of the spar torpedo , an explosive charge pushed against the hull of a warship by a small boat . For the first time , a large warship faced a serious threat from a smaller one — and given the relative <unk> of <unk> against ironclads , the threat from the spar torpedo was taken seriously . The U.S. Navy converted four of its monitors to become <unk> armored spar @-@ torpedo vessels while under construction in 1864 – 5 , but these vessels never saw action . Another proposal , the towed or ' Harvey ' torpedo , involved an explosive on a line or <unk> ; either to deter a ship from <unk> or to make a torpedo attack by a boat less <unk> . 
 A more practical and influential weapon was the self @-@ propelled or Whitehead torpedo . <unk> in 1868 and deployed in the 1870s , the Whitehead torpedo formed part of the armament of ironclads of the 1880s like HMS <unk> and the Italian <unk> <unk> and Enrico <unk> . The ironclad 's vulnerability to the torpedo was a key part of the critique of armored warships made by the <unk> <unk> school of naval thought ; it appeared that any ship armored enough to prevent destruction by gunfire would be slow enough to be easily caught by torpedo . In practice , however , the <unk> <unk> was only briefly influential and the torpedo formed part of the confusing mixture of weapons possessed by ironclads . 
 The first ironclads were built on wooden or iron hulls , and protected by wrought iron armor backed by thick wooden <unk> . <unk> were still being built with wooden hulls into the 1870s . 
 Using iron construction for warships offered advantages for the engineering of the hull . However , <unk> iron had many military disadvantages , and offered technical problems which kept wooden hulls in use for many years , particularly for long @-@ range cruising warships . 
 Iron ships had first been proposed for military use in the 1820s . In the 1830s and 1840s , France , Britain and the United States had all experimented with iron @-@ <unk> but <unk> gunboats and frigates . However , the iron @-@ <unk> frigate was abandoned by the end of the 1840s , because iron hulls were more vulnerable to solid shot ; iron was more brittle than wood , and iron frames more likely to fall out of shape than wood . 
 The <unk> of <unk> iron for warship hulls meant that iron was only adopted as a building material for battleships when protected by armor . However , iron gave the naval architect many advantages . Iron allowed larger ships and more flexible design , for instance the use of <unk> bulkheads on the lower decks . Warrior , built of iron , was longer and faster than the wooden @-@ <unk> Gloire . Iron could be produced to order and used immediately , in contrast to the need to give wood a long period of <unk> . And , given the large quantities of wood required to build a steam warship and the falling cost of iron , iron hulls were increasingly cost @-@ effective . The main reason for the French use of wooden hulls for the ironclad fleet built in the 1860s was that the French iron industry could not supply enough , and the main reason why Britain built its handful of wooden @-@ <unk> ironclads was to make best use of hulls already started and wood already bought . 
 Wooden hulls continued to be used for long @-@ range and smaller ironclads , because iron nevertheless had a significant disadvantage . Iron hulls suffered quick <unk> by marine life , slowing the ships down — <unk> for a European <unk> close to dry docks , but a difficulty for long @-@ range ships . The only solution was to sheath the iron hull first in wood and then in copper , a laborious and expensive process which made wooden construction remain attractive . Iron and wood were to some extent interchangeable : the Japanese <unk> and <unk> ordered in 1875 were sister @-@ ships , but one was built of iron and the other of composite construction . 
 After 1872 , steel started to be introduced as a material for construction . Compared to iron , steel allows for greater structural strength for a lower weight . The French Navy led the way with the use of steel in its fleet , starting with the <unk> , laid down in 1873 and launched in 1876 . <unk> nonetheless had wrought iron armor plate , and part of her exterior hull was iron rather than steel . 
 Even though Britain led the world in steel production , the Royal Navy was slow to adopt steel warships . The <unk> process for steel manufacture produced too many imperfections for large @-@ scale use on ships . French manufacturers used the <unk> @-@ Martin process to produce adequate steel , but British technology <unk> behind . The first all @-@ steel warships built by the Royal Navy were the dispatch vessels <unk> and Mercury , laid down in 1875 and 1876 . 
 Iron @-@ built ships used wood as part of their protection scheme . HMS Warrior was protected by 4 @.@ 5 in ( 114 mm ) of wrought iron backed by 15 in ( 381 mm ) of <unk> , the strongest shipbuilding wood . The wood played two roles , preventing <unk> and also preventing the shock of a hit damaging the structure of the ship . Later , wood and iron were combined in ' sandwich ' armor , for instance in HMS <unk> . 
 Steel was also an obvious material for armor . It was tested in the 1860s , but the steel of the time was too brittle and <unk> when struck by shells . Steel became practical to use when a way was found to fuse steel onto wrought iron plates , giving a form of compound armor . This compound armor was used by the British in ships built from the late 1870s , first for turret armor ( starting with HMS <unk> ) and then for all armor ( starting with HMS <unk> of 1882 ) . The French and German navies adopted the innovation almost immediately , with licenses being given for the use of the ' Wilson System ' of producing fused armor . 
 The first ironclads to have all @-@ steel armor were the Italian <unk> <unk> and Enrico <unk> . Though the ships were laid down in 1873 their armor was not purchased from France until 1877 . The French navy decided in 1880 to adopt compound armor for its fleet , but found it limited in supply , so from 1884 the French navy was using steel armor . Britain stuck to compound armor until 1889 . 
 The ultimate ironclad armor was case hardened nickel @-@ steel . In 1890 , the U.S. Navy tested steel armor hardened by the Harvey process and found it superior to compound armor . For several years ' Harvey steel ' was the state of the art , produced in the U.S. , France , Germany , Britain , Austria and Italy . In 1894 , the German firm <unk> developed gas <unk> , which further hardened steel armor . The German Kaiser Friedrich III , laid down in 1895 , was the first ship to benefit from the new ' <unk> armor ' and the new armor was quickly adopted ; the Royal Navy using it from HMS Canopus , laid down in 1896 . By 1901 almost all new battleships used <unk> armor , though the U.S. continued to use Harvey armor alongside until the end of the decade . 
 The equivalent strengths of the different armor plates was as follows : 15 in ( 381 mm ) of wrought iron was equivalent to 12 in ( 305 mm ) of either plain steel or compound iron and steel armor , and to 7 @.@ 75 in ( 197 mm ) of Harvey armor or 5 @.@ 75 in ( 146 mm ) of <unk> armor . 
 <unk> construction also <unk> the later debate in battleship design between <unk> and ' all @-@ or @-@ nothing ' armour design . Warrior was only semi @-@ armoured , and could have been disabled by hits on the bow and stern . As the thickness of armor grew to protect ships from the increasingly heavy guns , the area of the ship which could be fully protected diminished . <unk> 's armor protection was largely limited to the central citadel amidships , protecting boilers and engines , turrets and magazines , and little else . An ingenious arrangement of <unk> @-@ filled compartments and <unk> bulkheads was intended to keep her stable and afloat in the event of heavy damage to her un @-@ armored sections . 
 The first ocean @-@ going ironclads carried masts and sails like their wooden predecessors , and these features were only gradually abandoned . Early steam engines were inefficient ; the wooden steam fleet of the Royal Navy could only carry " 5 to 9 days coal " , and the situation was similar with the early ironclads . Warrior also illustrates two design features which aided hybrid propulsion ; she had retractable screws to reduce drag while under sail ( though in practice the steam engine was run at a low <unk> ) , and a <unk> funnel which could be folded down to the deck level . 
 Ships designed for coastal warfare , like the floating batteries of the <unk> , or USS <unk> and her sisters , <unk> with masts from the beginning . The British HMS <unk> , started in 1869 , was the first large , ocean @-@ going ironclad to <unk> with masts . Her principal role was for combat in the English Channel and other European waters ; and while her coal supplies gave her enough range to cross the Atlantic , she would have had little endurance on the other side of the ocean . The <unk> and the similar ships commissioned by the British and Russian navies in the 1870s were the exception rather than the rule . Most ironclads of the 1870s retained masts , and only the Italian navy , which during that decade was focused on short @-@ range operations in the Adriatic , built consistently <unk> ironclads . 
 During the 1860s , steam engines improved with the adoption of double @-@ expansion steam engines , which used 30 – 40 % less coal than earlier models . The Royal Navy decided to switch to the double @-@ expansion engine in 1871 , and by 1875 they were widespread . However , this development alone was not enough to herald the end of the mast . Whether this was due to a conservative desire to retain sails , or was a rational response to the operational and strategic situation , is a matter of debate . A steam @-@ only fleet would require a network of coaling stations worldwide , which would need to be fortified at great expense to stop them falling into enemy hands . Just as significantly , because of <unk> problems with the technology of the boilers which provided steam for the engines , the performance of double @-@ expansion engines was rarely as good in practice as it was in theory . 
 During the 1870s the distinction grew between ' first @-@ class ironclads ' or ' battleships ' on the one hand , and ' cruising ironclads ' designed for long @-@ range work on the other . The demands on first @-@ class ironclads for very heavy armor and armament meant increasing displacement , which reduced speed under sail ; and the fashion for turrets and barbettes made a sailing rig increasingly <unk> . HMS <unk> , launched in 1876 but not commissioned until 1881 , was the last British battleship to carry masts , and these were widely seen as a mistake . The start of the 1880s saw the end of sailing rig on ironclad battleships . 
 <unk> persisted on ' cruising ironclads ' for much longer . During the 1860s , the French navy had produced the Alma and La <unk> classes as small , long @-@ range ironclads as overseas cruisers and the British had responded with ships like HMS <unk> of 1870 . The Russian ship General @-@ Admiral , laid down in 1870 and completed in 1875 , was a model of a fast , long @-@ range ironclad which was likely to be able to <unk> and <unk> ships like <unk> . Even the later HMS Shannon , often described as the first British armored cruiser , would have been too slow to <unk> General @-@ Admiral . While Shannon was the last British ship with a retractable <unk> , later armored cruisers of the 1870s retained sailing rig , <unk> speed under steam in consequence . It took until 1881 for the Royal Navy to lay down a long @-@ range armored warship capable of catching enemy commerce raiders , HMS Warspite , which was completed in 1888 . While sailing rigs were obsolescent for all purposes by the end of the 1880s , rigged ships were in service until the early years of the 20th century . 
 The final evolution of ironclad propulsion was the adoption of the triple @-@ expansion steam engine , a further refinement which was first adopted in HMS Sans Pareil , laid down in 1885 and commissioned in 1891 . Many ships also used a forced draught to get additional power from their engines , and this system was widely used until the introduction of the steam turbine in the mid @-@ 1900s ( decade ) . 
 While ironclads spread rapidly in navies worldwide , there were few pitched naval battles involving ironclads . Most European nations settled differences on land , and the Royal Navy struggled to maintain a deterrent parity with at least France , while providing suitable protection to Britain 's commerce and colonial outposts worldwide . <unk> remained , for the British Royal Navy , a matter of defending the British Isles first and projecting power abroad second . Those naval engagements of the latter half of the 19th @-@ century which involved ironclads normally involved colonial actions or clashes between second @-@ rate naval powers . But these encounters were often enough to convince British policy @-@ makers of the increasing <unk> of strictly naval foreign intervention , from Hampton Roads in the American Civil War to the <unk> combined defences of naval <unk> such as <unk> and Cherbourg . 
 The United Kingdom possessed the largest navy in the world for the whole of the ironclad period . The Royal Navy was the second to adopt ironclad warships , and it applied them worldwide in their whole range of roles . In the age of sail , the British strategy for war depended on the Royal Navy mounting a blockade of the ports of the enemy . Because of the limited endurance of <unk> , this was no longer possible , so the British at times considered the risk @-@ laden plan of engaging an enemy fleet in harbor as soon as war broke out . To this end , the Royal Navy developed a series of ' coast @-@ defence battleships ' , starting with the <unk> class . These ' <unk> monitors ' were markedly different from the other high @-@ seas ironclads of the period and were an important precursor of the modern battleship . As long @-@ range monitors they could reach Bermuda <unk> , for example . However , they were still armed with only four heavy guns and were as vulnerable to mines and obstructions ( and enemy monitors ) as the original monitors of the Union Navy proved to be during the Civil War . The British prepared for an overwhelming mortar bombardment of <unk> by the close of the Crimean War , but never considered running the smoke @-@ ridden , shallow @-@ water gauntlet straight to St. Petersburg with ironclads . Likewise , monitors proved <unk> unable to ' overwhelm ' enemy fortifications single @-@ handed during the American conflict , though their low @-@ profile and heavy armour protection made them ideal for running <unk> . <unk> and obstructions , however , negated these advantages — a problem the British Admiralty frequently acknowledged but never countered throughout the period . The British never laid down enough <unk> @-@ class ' battleships ' to instantly overwhelm Cherbourg , <unk> or even New York City with gunfire . Although throughout the 1860s and 1870s the Royal Navy was still in many respects superior to its potential rivals , by the early 1880s widespread concern about the threat from France and Germany culminated in the Naval Defence Act , which promulgated the idea of a ' two @-@ power standard ' , that Britain should possess as many ships as the next two navies combined . This standard provoked aggressive shipbuilding in the 1880s and 1890s . 
 British ships did not participate in any major wars in the ironclad period . The Royal Navy 's ironclads only saw action as part of colonial battles or one @-@ sided engagements like the bombardment of Alexandria in 1882 . <unk> British interests against Ahmed ' <unk> 's Egyptian revolt , a British fleet opened fire on the fortifications around the port of Alexandria . A mixture of centre @-@ battery and turret ships bombarded Egyptian positions for most of a day , forcing the Egyptians to retreat ; return fire from Egyptian guns was heavy at first , but inflicted little damage , killing only five British sailors . Few Egyptian guns were actually dismounted , on the other hand , and the fortifications themselves were typically left intact . Had the Egyptians actually utilised the heavy mortars that were at their disposal , they might have quickly turned the tide , for the attacking British ironclads found it easy ( for accuracy 's sake ) to simply anchor whilst firing — perfect targets for high @-@ angle fire upon their thinly armoured <unk> . 
 The French navy built the first ironclad to try to gain a strategic advantage over the British , but were consistently out @-@ built by the British . Despite taking the lead with a number of innovations like breech @-@ loading weapons and steel construction , the French navy could never match the size of the Royal Navy . In the 1870s , the construction of ironclads ceased for a while in France as the <unk> <unk> school of naval thought took prominence , suggesting that torpedo boats and <unk> cruisers would be the future of warships . Like the British , the French navy saw little action with its ironclads ; the French blockade of Germany in the Franco @-@ Prussian War was ineffective , as the war was settled entirely on land . 
 Russia built a number of ironclads , generally copies of British or French designs . Nonetheless , there were real innovations from Russia ; the first true type of ironclad armored cruiser , the General @-@ Admiral of the 1870s , and a set of remarkably badly designed circular battleships referred to as ' <unk> ' ( for Admiral <unk> , who conceived the design ) . The Russian Navy pioneered the wide @-@ scale use of torpedo boats during the Russo @-@ Turkish War of 1877 – 1878 , mainly out of necessity because of the superior numbers and quality of ironclads used by the Turkish navy . Russia expanded her navy in the 1880s and 1890s with modern armored cruisers and battleships , but the ships were manned by inexperienced crews and politically appointed leadership , which enhanced their defeat in the Battle of <unk> on 27 May 1905 . 
 The U.S. Navy ended the Civil War with about fifty monitor @-@ type coastal ironclads ; by the 1870s most of these were laid up in reserve , leaving the USA virtually without an ironclad fleet . Another five large monitors were ordered in the 1870s . The limitations of the monitor type effectively prevented the USA from projecting power overseas , and until the 1890s the USA would have come off badly in a conflict with even Spain or the Latin American powers . The 1890s saw the beginning of what became the Great White Fleet , and it was the modern pre @-@ <unk> and armored cruisers built in the 1890s which defeated the Spanish fleet in the Spanish – American War of 1898 . This started a new era of naval warfare . 
 There is no clearly defined end to the ironclad , besides the transition from wood hulls to all @-@ metal . <unk> continued to be used in World War I. Towards the end of the 19th century , the descriptions ' battleship ' and ' armored cruiser ' came to replace the term ' ironclad ' . 
 The proliferation of ironclad battleship designs came to an end in the 1890s as navies reached a consensus on the design of battleships , producing the type known as the pre @-@ <unk> . These ships are sometimes covered in treatments of the ironclad warship . The next evolution of battleship design , the dreadnought , is never referred to as an ' ironclad ' . 
 Most of the ironclads of the 1870s and 1880s served into the 1900s ( decade ) . For instance , a handful of US navy monitors laid down in the 1870s saw active service in World War I. Pre @-@ <unk> battleships and cruisers of the 1890s saw widespread action in World War I and in some cases through to World War II . 
 The example of the ironclads had some bearing on the history of the tank , as ironclad warships became an inspiration for ideas of <unk> and other armored vehicles . H. G. Wells , in his short story The Land <unk> , published in The Strand Magazine in December 1903 , described the use of large , armoured cross @-@ country vehicles , armed with cannon and machine guns , and equipped with <unk> wheels 
 Parts of USS <unk> have been recovered and are being <unk> and displayed at the Mariners ' Museum in Newport News , Virginia

 The new United States Navy <unk> @-@ class guided missile destroyer has been described as bearing resemblance to ironclads . 
 Little <unk> is the fourth and final poem of T. S. Eliot 's Four <unk> , a series of poems that discuss time , perspective , humanity , and salvation . It was first published in September 1942 after being delayed for over a year because of the air @-@ raids on Great Britain during World War II and Eliot 's declining health . The title refers to a small Anglican community in <unk> , established by Nicholas <unk> in the 17th century and scattered during the English Civil War . 
 The poem uses the combined image of fire and <unk> fire to emphasise the need for purification and <unk> . According to the poet , humanity 's flawed understanding of life and turning away from God leads to a cycle of warfare , but this can be overcome by <unk> the lessons of the past . Within the poem , the narrator meets a ghost that is a combination of various poets and literary figures . Little <unk> focuses on the unity of past , present , and future , and claims that understanding this unity is necessary for salvation . 
 Following the completion of the third Four <unk> poem , The Dry <unk> , Eliot 's health declined and he stayed in <unk> Green , Surrey while he recovered . During this time , Eliot started writing Little <unk> . The first draft was completed in July 1941 but he was dissatisfied with it . He believed the problems with the poem lay with his own inability to write , and that , precipitated by air raids on London , he had started the poem with too little preparation and had written it too quickly . After the first draft was written , he set the poem aside , and he left in September to lecture throughout Great Britain . 
 After months of not working on the poem , Eliot began to feel compelled to finish it ; it was not until August 1942 , however , that he started working on it again . In total , there were five drafts . The poem was finished by 19 September 1942 and published in the October New English Weekly . Little <unk> was intended to conclude the Four <unk> series , <unk> Eliot 's views expressed in this series of poems . 
 Little <unk> was the home of an Anglican community established in <unk> by Nicholas <unk> . The <unk> household lived a Christian life according to High Church principles and the Book of Common Prayer . The religious community was dispersed during the English Civil War between <unk> and <unk> but reformed , ending with the death of John <unk> in <unk> . Eliot had visited the site in May 1936 . 
 Unlike the other locations mentioned in the titles of the Four <unk> poems , Eliot had no direct connection to the original Christian community . As such , the community is supposed to represent almost any religious community . 
 Critics classify Little <unk> as a poem of fire with an emphasis on <unk> and the <unk> fire . The beginning of the poem discusses time and winter , with attention paid to the arrival of summer . The images of snow , which provoke desires for a spiritual life , transition into an analysis of the four classical elements of fire , earth , air and water and how fire is the primary element of the four . Following this is a discussion on death and destruction , things <unk> , and regret for past events . 
 While using Dante 's <unk> <unk> style , the poem continues by describing the Battle of Britain . The image of warfare <unk> with the depiction of <unk> , and the Holy Spirit is juxtaposed with the air @-@ raids on London . In the second section , a ghost , representing the poets of the past stuck between worlds , begins talking to the narrator of the poem . The ghost discusses change , art in general , and how humankind is flawed . The only way to overcome the problematic condition of humanity , according to the ghost , is to experience <unk> through fire . The fire is described in a manner similar to Julian of Norwich 's writing about God 's love and discussed in relationship to the shirt of <unk> , a shirt that burns its wearer . Little <unk> continues by describing the <unk> of the present and how history exists in a pattern . The poem concludes by explaining how sacrifice is needed to allow an individual to die into life and be reborn , and that salvation should be the goal of humankind . 
 In terms of renewal , Eliot believed that suffering was needed for all of society before new life could begin . The original Little <unk> community was built for living on monastic lines , but the community was damaged and dispersed by Puritan forces during the English Civil War in 1646 . The church , the centre of the community , was restored in 1714 and again in 1853 . The image of religious renewal is combined with the image of the London air @-@ raids and the constant fighting and destruction within the world . This compound image is used to discuss the connection of holy places with the Holy Spirit , <unk> , communion with the dead , and the repetition of history . The theme is also internal to Eliot 's own poems ; the image of the rose garden at the end Little <unk> is the image that begins <unk> Norton and the journey is made circular . Also , the depiction of time within the poem is similar to the way time operates within The Family <unk> . 
 Like the other poems making up the Four <unk> , Little <unk> deals with the past , present , and future , and humanity 's place within them as each generation is seemingly united . In the second section , there is a ghost who is the compilation of various poets , including Dante , Swift , Yeats , and others . When the ghost joins the poet , the narrator states " Knowing myself yet being someone other " . This suggests that the different times merge at the same time that the different personalities begin to merge , allowing a communication and connection with the dead . Later , in the fourth section , humanity is given a choice between the Holy Spirit or the bombing of London ; redemption or destruction . God 's love allows humankind to be <unk> and escape the living hell through <unk> by fire . The end of the poem describes how Eliot has attempted to help the world as a poet . He parallels his work in language with working on the soul or working on society . 
 The ghost , a combination of many literary figures , was originally addressed in the poem as " <unk> <unk> " before being revised as an ambiguous " you " . " <unk> <unk> " was Dante 's way of addressing <unk> <unk> , a former mentor whom he meets in Hell to which he has been condemned for <unk> . Eliot , in a letter to John <unk> dated 27 August 1942 , explained why he changed the wording : 
 I think you will recognise that it was necessary to get rid of <unk> for two reasons . The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that . However , I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to <unk> to him the particular vice which took <unk> there . <unk> , although the reference to that <unk> is intended to be explicit , I wish the effect of the whole to be <unk> which is more appropriate . That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of <unk> 26 where the poets are found . 
 The theme of swimming through flames is connected to the depiction of <unk> <unk> , a poet that influenced Dante , seeking such a state in <unk> <unk> . However , the depiction of swimming was transformed into an image of dancing , an act that appears throughout Yeats 's poetry , within <unk> flames . The critic Dominic <unk> suggests that , in combining the image of dancing with <unk> , Eliot <unk> Dante 's and Yeats 's poetic themes . 
 The Portage to San <unk> of <unk> is a 1981 literary and philosophical novella by George Steiner , in which Jewish Nazi hunters find a fictional Adolf Hitler ( <unk> ) alive in the Amazon jungle thirty years after the end of World War II . The book generated considerable controversy after its publication because in it , Steiner , who is Jewish , allows Hitler to defend himself when he is put on trial in the jungle by his captors . There Hitler maintains that Israel <unk> its existence to the Holocaust and that he is the " benefactor of the Jews " . 
 The Portage to San <unk> of <unk> was a 1983 <unk> in the <unk> / Faulkner Award for Fiction . It was adapted for the theatre by British playwright Christopher Hampton and was staged in London in April 1982 with Alec <unk> playing the part of Adolf Hitler . It was also staged in Hartford , Connecticut in the United States in 1983 and starred John <unk> as Hitler . 
 From his base in Tel Aviv , Holocaust survivor Emmanuel <unk> directs a group of Jewish Nazi hunters in search of Adolf Hitler . <unk> believes that the former <unk> is still alive , and following rumours and <unk> , he tracks Hitler 's movements through South America , until after months of wading through swamps in the Amazon jungle , the search party finds the 90 @-@ year @-@ old alive in a clearing . <unk> flies to San <unk> where he awaits the group 's return with their captive . But getting the old man out of the jungle alive is more difficult than getting in , and their progress is further hampered by heavy thunderstorms . 
 Meanwhile , broken and incoherent radio messages between <unk> and the search party are intercepted by intelligence agents tracking their progress , and rumours begin to spread across the world of Hitler 's capture . <unk> flare up over his impending trial , where it will be held and under whose jurisdiction . <unk> is identified as the nearest airfield to the last known location of the search party , and aircraft begin arriving at the hitherto unknown town . But when the search party loses radio contact with <unk> , they must make a decision : do they sit out the storms and deliver their captive to <unk> later , or do they try Hitler in the jungle before their prize is <unk> from them by the world at large , who they know will be waiting ? Their decision is the latter , and against <unk> 's advice ( " You must not let him speak ... his tongue is like no other " ) they prepare for a trial with a judge , prosecution and defence attorneys selected from the members of the search party . <unk> , a local Indian <unk> , is asked to observe the trial as an independent witness . 
 The attention Hitler is receiving , however , <unk> his strength , and when the trial begins , he <unk> aside his " defence attorney " and begins a long speech in four parts in his own defence : 
 Firstly , Hitler claims he took his doctrines from the Jews and copied the notion of the master race from the <unk> people and their need to separate themselves from the " <unk> " . " My racism is a parody of <unk> , a hungry imitation . " 
 Hitler <unk> the Final <unk> by maintaining that the Jews ' God , <unk> than any other , <unk> its subjects , continually demanding more than they can give and " <unk> " them with ideals that cannot be attained . The " virus of <unk> " had to be stopped . 
 Hitler states that he was not the originator of evil . " [ Stalin ] had <unk> <unk> when I was still a <unk> <unk> in Munich . " Further , Hitler asserts that the number of lives lost due to his actions are <unk> by various world atrocities , including those in Russia , China and Africa . 
 Lastly , Hitler maintains that the Reich <unk> Israel and suggests that he is the <unk> " whose infamous <unk> were allowed by God in order to bring His people home . " He closes by asking , " Should you not honour me who have made ... <unk> a reality ? " 
 At the end of his speech , <unk> is the first to react and jumps up shouting " <unk> " , only to be drowned out by the appearance of a helicopter over the clearing . 
 Emmanuel <unk> – Jewish Holocaust survivor and director of the search party to find Hitler ; after <unk> out of a death pit in <unk> he never took the time to <unk> and embarked on a life @-@ consuming obsession to bring those responsible for the <unk> to justice . 
 <unk> – search party leader and " presiding judge " at Hitler 's trial ; he is <unk> 's <unk> and torn between leading the party into " <unk> <unk> and green <unk> " and turning his back on the " quiet <unk> of <unk> 's conviction " . 
 Gideon <unk> – falls ill and dies before the trial begins ; during one of his fever @-@ induced <unk> he suggests that Hitler is Jewish ; he had sought out <unk> after being released from a <unk> and spending three years <unk> in Paris where the care @-@ free living consumed him with guilt . 
 Elie <unk> – Orthodox Jew and " prosecution attorney " at the trial ; he is the moral <unk> of the group , but his convictions are disturbed by Gideon <unk> 's fever @-@ induced <unk> that Hitler is Jewish and ends up believing that Hitler may be the second <unk> . 
 Isaac <unk> – an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and witness at the trial ; he is the son of Isaac <unk> senior , former member of the search party killed earlier in a <unk> in São Paulo ; he joined the party to avenge his father 's death . 
 John Asher – half @-@ Jewish and reluctant " defence attorney " at the trial ; fascinated by the capture of <unk> and the rumours circulating that Hitler may be alive , he had approached Nazi hunter <unk> who directed him to <unk> ; despite being an " <unk> " ( no ties to the Holocaust ) <unk> assigned him to the search party because of his military training and his clear @-@ <unk> ( " no metaphysical lusts , no <unk> for <unk> " ) . 
 <unk> – local Indian <unk> and independent witness at the trial ; previously the search party 's guide who had abandoned them when they insisted on entering <unk> regions of the jungle , he continued tracking them from a distance before revealing himself . 
 Adolf Hitler – now 90 years old , the former leader of the Third Reich had not died in the <unk> in Berlin , but escaped to South America and hid in the Amazon jungle . 
 George Steiner , literary critic for The New Yorker and The New York Times , had written about the Holocaust in some of his previous books , including <unk> <unk> ( 1964 ) , Language and Silence ( 1967 ) and In <unk> 's Castle ( 1971 ) . Many of the ideas Steiner expresses in The Portage to San <unk> of <unk> were reworked from these earlier works . Steiner told New York Times editor D. J. R. <unk> that this book arose out of his lifelong work on language . " Central to everything I am and believe and have written is my <unk> ... that you can use human speech both to <unk> , to love , to build , to forgive and also to torture , to hate , to destroy and to <unk> . " 
 Commenting on the controversy the book generated , Steiner admitted to literary journalist and critic Ron <unk> ( author of Explaining Hitler ) that he too was disturbed by it , adding that his fictional Hitler had gotten the better of him , " <unk> or <unk> @-@ like " . He said that it felt like the book " wrote me " . Steiner also pointed out that the novella is not only about his thoughts on the Holocaust , but also about the horrific events that took place in countries like Cambodia , Vietnam , El Salvador and <unk> : " My feeling is that one has to <unk> with the <unk> if one can . " 
 Steiner wrote The Portage to San <unk> of <unk> in 1975 and 1976 in Geneva , Switzerland , and the 120 @-@ page work originally appeared in the Spring 1979 issue of the United States literary magazine , The Kenyon Review . It also appeared in the Spring 1980 issue of <unk> , the British literary magazine . Its first publication in book form , with minor revisions by Steiner , was in May 1981 by <unk> and <unk> in the United Kingdom — and as requested by Steiner , it was a paperback original . The first United States edition was published in hardcover in April 1982 by Simon & Schuster . 
 The Portage to San <unk> of <unk> was adapted for the theatre in 1982 by British playwright Christopher Hampton . It was staged in April 1982 at London 's <unk> Theatre under the direction of John Dexter with Alec <unk> playing the part of Adolf Hitler . <unk> won the 1982 Evening Standard Theatre Award for best actor for this performance . In 1983 the production moved to the United States where it played at the Hartford Stage Company in Hartford , Connecticut , directed by Mark <unk> and starring John <unk> as Hitler . 
 In another review in The New York Times John Leonard wrote that while the book has its strong points , " some wit , a <unk> disdain , multiplicity of character and a South American swamp @-@ life that <unk> " , its weaknesses are that " the characters are really ideas , ... the symbols clash and there are too many echoes of better books by <unk> and <unk> " . But Leonard 's biggest criticism of the book was Hitler 's speech , which he called " obscene " , and Steiner 's decision to end the book at that point , which Leonard said " not only denies the power of art to arrange and transcend , but ... makes me sick to my stomach . " 
 The book generated considerable controversy because of its apparent " admiration for Hitler " . The controversy grew further when the faithful stage adaptation ( " too faithful " , according to Steiner ) was performed in the United Kingdom and the United States . 
 Hitler 's speech at the end of the book disturbed many readers and critics . Steiner not only lets Hitler justify his past , he allows him the ( almost ) last word before the outside world invades . The fact that Steiner is Jewish made this speech in particular even more contentious . One critic , while acknowledging that Steiner always saw Hitler as " the incarnation of unprecedented and unparalleled evil " , felt that there was no clear distinction in the book between Steiner 's own views and those of his fictional Hitler , even going so far as to accuse Steiner , who rejects Jewish nationalism and is a critic of Israel 's treatment of the Palestinians , of anti @-@ Semitism . 
 In contrast , a Time magazine article at the time felt that Steiner 's intention for the Hitler speech was to use it to explore his previously stated belief " that Hitler wielded language as an almost supernatural force " , drawing attention to Nazi hunter Emmanuel <unk> 's warning from the book regarding Hitler : " There shall come a man who ... will know the grammar of hell and teach it to others . He will know the sounds of madness and <unk> and make them seem music . " 
 <unk> have been known since the early 19th century , and were initially thought to be reptiles . They were described at various times as <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , although these names are now rarely used . Animals now grouped in <unk> were spread out among several amphibian groups until the early 20th century , when they were found to belong to a distinct taxon based on the structure of their vertebrae . <unk> means " cut vertebrae " , as each <unk> is divided into several parts . 
 Another group called <unk> was named by Cope in 1868 . Cope classified <unk> as a <unk> of <unk> , placing many small , amphibian @-@ like animals within it . Among them were <unk> , once placed in <unk> . <unk> was later placed as a <unk> with other <unk> , but confusion existed for many years over the classification of small amphibians . 
 <unk> <unk> were often the dominant <unk> animals in their environments . Large <unk> of <unk> with hundreds of individuals preserved together have been found in the southwestern United States . They have often been interpreted as mass death events caused by droughts in floodplain environments . Recent studies show these dense <unk> were instead probably the result of currents accumulating dead individuals in certain areas . These environments seem to have had little diversity , as they were inhabited almost exclusively by <unk> . 
 Other studies place modern amphibians as the descendants of <unk> and place <unk> in a more basal position within the stem of <unk> . Below is a cladogram from <unk> and <unk> ( 1999 ) placing <unk> outside crown <unk> : 
 Most phylogenetic analyses of <unk> interrelationships focus on individual families . One of the first broad @-@ scale studies of <unk> phylogeny was conducted by paleontologist Andrew <unk> in 1990 . A 2007 study made a " <unk> " of all <unk> families , combining the family @-@ level trees of previous studies . The following cladogram is modified from <unk> et al . ( 2007 ) : 
 <unk> and Warren also named <unk> , a clade of small aquatic <unk> from the <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . They placed <unk> within <unk> , but more recent studies disagree on their position . For example , a 2007 study places them even more basal than <unk> , while a 2008 study keeps them as basal <unk> . 
 One is that they evolved from <unk> <unk> . Another is that they evolved from <unk> , most likely the <unk> . A third hypothesis is that <unk> descended from <unk> and frogs and <unk> evolved from <unk> . 
 Although the earliest <unk> were primarily <unk> , they had the ability to feed on land . Later , <unk> and <unk> , some well adapted to terrestrial life , also fed on land . Some <unk> became better adapted toward life in water , and shifted their diets toward aquatic organisms . The first primarily aquatic <unk> were <unk> in the <unk> . <unk> and <unk> became independently aquatic and also returned to this type of feeding . 
 Body impressions of Early <unk> <unk> from Pennsylvania suggest that some terrestrial <unk> mated on land like some modern amphibians . They reproduced through internal fertilization rather than mating in water . The presence of three individuals in one block of sandstone shows that the <unk> were gregarious . The head of one individual rests under the tail of another in what may be a courtship display . Internal fertilization and similar courtship behavior are seen in modern <unk> . 
 <unk> larvae are often distinguished by poorly developed bones and the presence of a <unk> apparatus , a series of bones that gills would attach to in life . However , some fully mature <unk> also possess <unk> bones but did not have external gills . A dense covering of scales is also seen in larvae and adults . Major body changes occur in <unk> , including the <unk> and strengthening of skull bones , the <unk> of <unk> bones , and an increase in body size . 
 <unk> was first mentioned in the historical record between 1121 and 1128 when he appears in a charter , which although likely a forgery , probably contains an authentic witness list . This document lists him as " <unk> archdeacon " , which means that he probably held the <unk> of Richmond . He was the nephew of <unk> , who was Archbishop of York from <unk> to 1140 . <unk> he owed his position as archdeacon to his uncle and was probably appointed at a young age . A charter of <unk> 's , dating to around 1138 , names <unk> explicitly as <unk> 's nephew . 
 After <unk> 's death in <unk> , <unk> was opposed to William 's return as archbishop , but was unsuccessful in his attempts to prevent William 's <unk> . William died a week after his return to York , however , and <unk> , along with Robert of <unk> , the Dean of York , secured the quick election of the new archbishop , Roger de <unk> L <unk> . 
 The case attracted commentary by two contemporary writers . John of Salisbury , who was a secretary for Theobald , added information about <unk> in a letter to Alexander III on unrelated business . In the section of the letter , John pointed out to the pope that no matter what others might say about <unk> , he had failed to secure other clergy willing to <unk> that he was innocent . Another contemporary , Gilbert Foliot , who was Bishop of Hereford , wrote to the pope to remind him that although <unk> 's <unk> had offered to prove his accusations by undergoing a trial by ordeal , this was essentially meaningless since canon law forbade the clergy from the ordeal . 
 <unk> had two sons , William de Bayeux and <unk> de <unk> . <unk> was a benefactor to a number of monasteries , including Drax Priory , <unk> Priory and <unk> Priory . He also gave land to a hospital in York and to the Templars and Hospitallers . 
 Both the central dense <unk> and embedded eye pattern use the size of the <unk> . The <unk> pattern <unk> start at <unk> , equivalent to minimal tropical storm intensity ( 40 mph , 65 km / h ) . The shape of the central dense <unk> is also considered . The eye pattern utilizes the <unk> of the cloud tops within the surrounding mass of thunderstorms and contrasts it with the temperature within the eye itself . The larger the temperature difference is , the stronger the tropical cyclone . Once a pattern is identified , the storm features ( such as length and <unk> of banding features ) are further analyzed to arrive at a particular T @-@ number . The <unk> pattern indicates little development is occurring , despite the cold cloud tops associated with the quickly evolving feature . 
 Several agencies issue Dvorak intensity numbers for tropical cyclones and their precursors , including the National Hurricane Center 's Tropical Analysis and <unk> Branch ( <unk> ) , the <unk> / <unk> <unk> Analysis Branch ( <unk> ) , and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center at the Naval Meteorology and <unk> Command in Pearl Harbor , Hawaii . 
 The initial development of this technique occurred in 1969 by Vernon Dvorak , using satellite pictures of tropical cyclones within the northwest Pacific ocean . The system as it was initially conceived involved pattern matching of cloud features with a development and decay model . As the technique matured through the 1970s and 1980s , measurement of cloud features became dominant in defining tropical cyclone intensity and central pressure of the tropical cyclone 's low @-@ pressure area . Use of infrared satellite imagery led to a more objective assessment of the strength of tropical cyclones with eyes , using the cloud top temperatures within the eyewall and contrasting them with the warm temperatures within the eye itself . <unk> on short term intensity change are used less frequently than they were back in the 1970s and 1980s . The central pressures assigned to tropical cyclones have required modification , as the original estimates were 5 @-@ 10 hPa ( 0 @.@ 15 @-@ 0 @.@ 29 inHg ) too low in the Atlantic and up to 20 hPa ( 0 @.@ 59 inHg ) too high in the northwest Pacific . This led to the development of a separate wind @-@ pressure relationship for the northwest Pacific , devised by Atkinson and Holliday in 1975 , then modified in 1977 . 
 As human analysts using the technique lead to <unk> biases , efforts have been made to make more objective estimates using computer programs , which have been aided by higher @-@ resolution satellite imagery and more powerful computers . Since tropical cyclone satellite patterns can <unk> over time , automated techniques use a six @-@ hour averaging period to lead to more reliable intensity estimates . Development of the objective Dvorak technique began in 1998 , which performed best with tropical cyclones that had eyes ( of hurricane or typhoon strength ) . It still required a manual center placement , keeping some <unk> within the process . By 2004 , an advanced objective Dvorak technique was developed which utilized banding features for systems below hurricane intensity and to <unk> determine the tropical cyclone 's center . A central pressure bias was uncovered in 2004 relating to the slope of the <unk> and cloud top temperatures which change with latitude that helped improve central pressure estimates within the objective technique . 
 In a developing cyclone , the technique takes advantage of the fact that cyclones of similar intensity tend to have certain characteristic features , and as they strengthen , they tend to change in appearance in a predictable manner . The structure and organization of the tropical cyclone are tracked over 24 hours to determine if the storm has weakened , maintained its intensity , or strengthened . Various central cloud and banding features are compared with <unk> that show typical storm patterns and their associated intensity . If infrared satellite imagery is available for a cyclone with a visible eye pattern , then the technique utilizes the difference between the temperature of the warm eye and the surrounding cold cloud tops to determine intensity ( colder cloud tops generally indicate a more intense storm ) . In each case a " T @-@ number " ( an abbreviation for Tropical Number ) and a Current <unk> ( <unk> ) value are assigned to the storm . These measurements range between 1 ( minimum intensity ) and 8 ( maximum intensity ) . The T @-@ number and <unk> value are the same except for weakening storms , in which case the <unk> is higher . For weakening systems , the <unk> is held as the tropical cyclone intensity for 12 hours , though research from the National Hurricane Center indicates that six hours is more reasonable . The table at right shows the approximate surface wind speed and sea level pressure that corresponds to a given T @-@ number . The amount a tropical cyclone can change in strength per 24 ‑ hour period is limited to 2 @.@ 5 T @-@ numbers per day . 
 The <unk> pattern , with its large and quickly developing mass of thick <unk> clouds spreading out from an area of convection near a tropical cyclone center within a short time frame , indicates little development . When it develops , rainbands and cloud lines around the tropical cyclone weaken and the thick cloud shield <unk> the circulation center . While it resembles a <unk> pattern , it is rarely seen . 
 The eye pattern utilizes the <unk> of the cloud tops within the surrounding mass of thunderstorms and contrasts it with the temperature within the eye itself . The larger the temperature difference is , the stronger the tropical cyclone . Winds within tropical cyclones can also be estimated by tracking features within the <unk> using rapid scan <unk> satellite imagery , whose pictures are taken minutes apart rather than every half @-@ hour . 
 Once a pattern is identified , the storm features ( such as length and <unk> of banding features ) are further analyzed to arrive at a particular T @-@ number . 
 Several agencies issue Dvorak intensity numbers for tropical cyclones and their precursors . These include the National Hurricane Center 's Tropical Analysis and <unk> Branch ( <unk> ) , the National <unk> and <unk> Administration 's <unk> Analysis Branch ( <unk> ) , and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center at the Naval Pacific Meteorology and <unk> Center in Pearl Harbor , Hawaii . 
 The National Hurricane Center will often quote Dvorak T @-@ numbers in their tropical cyclone products . The following example is from discussion number 3 of Tropical Depression 24 ( eventually Hurricane <unk> ) of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season : 
 Note that in this case the Dvorak T @-@ number ( in this case <unk> ) was simply used as a guide but other factors determined how the NHC decided to set the system 's intensity . 
 The Cooperative Institute for Meteorological <unk> Studies ( <unk> ) at the University of Wisconsin – Madison has developed the <unk> Dvorak <unk> ( <unk> ) . This is a modified version of the Dvorak technique which uses computer algorithms rather than <unk> human interpretation to arrive at a <unk> number . This is generally not implemented for tropical depressions or weak tropical storms . The China Meteorological Agency ( <unk> ) is expected to start using the standard 1984 version of Dvorak in the near future . The Indian Meteorological Department ( <unk> ) prefers using visible satellite imagery over infrared imagery due to a perceived high bias in estimates derived from infrared imagery during the early morning hours of convective maximum . The Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) uses the infrared version of Dvorak over the visible imagery version . Hong Kong Observatory and JMA continue to utilize Dvorak after tropical cyclone landfall . Various centers hold on to the maximum current intensity for 6 – 12 hours , though this rule is broken when rapid weakening is obvious . 
 Citizen science site Cyclone Center uses a modified version of the Dvorak technique to <unk> post @-@ 1970 tropical weather . 
 The most significant benefit of the use of the technique is that it has provided a more complete history of tropical cyclone intensity in areas where aircraft reconnaissance is neither possible nor routinely available . <unk> estimates of maximum sustained wind are currently within 5 miles per hour ( 8 @.@ 0 km / h ) of what aircraft are able to measure half of the time , though the assignment of intensity of systems with strengths between moderate tropical @-@ storm force ( 60 miles per hour ( 97 km / h ) ) and weak <unk> or typhoon @-@ force ( 100 miles per hour ( 160 km / h ) ) is the least certain . Its overall precision has not always been true , as <unk> in the technique led to intensity changes between 1972 and 1977 of up to 20 miles per hour ( 32 km / h ) . The method is internally consistent in that it <unk> rapid increases or decreases in tropical cyclone intensity . Some tropical cyclones <unk> in strength more than the 2 @.@ 5 T numbers per day limit allowed by the rule , which can work to the technique 's disadvantage and has led to occasional abandonment of the constraints since the 1980s . Systems with small eyes near the limb , or edge , of a satellite image can be biased too weakly using the technique , which can be resolved through use of polar @-@ orbiting satellite imagery . Subtropical cyclone intensity cannot be determined using Dvorak , which led to the development of the <unk> @-@ <unk> technique in 1975 . <unk> undergoing extratropical transition , losing their thunderstorm activity , see their <unk> underestimated using the Dvorak technique . This led to the development of the Miller and <unk> extratropical transition technique which can be used under these circumstances . 
 New York State Route <unk> ( NY <unk> ) was a state highway in central New York in the United States . It served as a connector between NY 31 , its parent route , in the Cayuga County village of <unk> and NY 5 in the Onondaga County town of Elbridge . NY <unk> was assigned c . 1933 , replacing New York State Route 293 , a route assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . The NY <unk> designation was removed in 1980 and replaced by County Route <unk> ( CR <unk> ) in Cayuga County and CR 99 in Onondaga County . 
 NY <unk> began at an intersection with its parent route , NY 31 , in the Cayuga County village of <unk> . The highway went eastward , intersecting with NY 34 less than 0 @.@ 1 miles ( 0 @.@ 2 km ) later . Much of <unk> was <unk> , with the highway passing residential homes and businesses as it progressed eastward through the village . The highway intersected with CR <unk> before leaving <unk> and entering the town of Brutus as Brutus Road . 
 In Brutus , NY <unk> continued to the east through the rural town , intersecting CR <unk> and passing the <unk> Rural Cemetery before turning to the southeast . After a short distance , the highway went through an isolated area of homes , where it intersected with CR 14 and CR <unk> . NY <unk> continued on , intersecting several local highways before crossing into Onondaga County and terminating at an intersection with NY 5 in the town of Elbridge . 
 What became NY <unk> was originally designated as NY 293 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . NY 293 was renumbered to NY <unk> c . 1933 , allowing the NY 293 designation to be transferred to another highway in Orange County . NY <unk> remained unchanged until January 2 , 1980 , when the NY <unk> designation was removed . 
 <unk> and maintenance of NY <unk> 's former routing was gradually transferred to the counties it went through , namely Cayuga and Onondaga . The first section to be transferred was the portion within Onondaga County , which was given to the county on April 1 , 1980 , and designated as CR 99 . The Cayuga County section of former NY <unk> was transferred to the county one year later on April 1 , 1981 , and designated as CR <unk> for the state route that preceded it .

It was the first visit by MLB since 1999 , and one anticipated as an important step to help <unk> relations with the United States that had begun to ease earlier in the year . 
 <unk> made his sixth straight opening day start in 2016 as the Dodgers won 15 – 0 . It also marked the first time the Dodgers had won six straight opening day games , all of which he started . On May 12 against the New York Mets , he struck out 13 while pitching a three @-@ hit complete game shutout . He set an MLB record with six consecutive starts with at least 10 strikeouts and no more than one walk and a club record with six consecutive starts with at least 10 strikeouts . He picked up his 100th strikeout on May 29 , while only walking five batters within that period . That was the lowest walk total for a pitcher reaching 100 strikeouts in the modern era , beating Cliff Lee who had seven walks in the 2010 season . On June 30 , 2016 , <unk> was placed on the 15 @-@ day disabled list due to back pain . He received an <unk> , which revealed that there was a mild <unk> disc in the back , and received an <unk> injection to treat the pain . He was named to the 2016 All @-@ Star team but was unable to pitch in the game due to his injury . On July 20 , the Dodgers shut down <unk> for an indefinite period of time . He continued to feel discomfort in his back after a simulated game . 
 <unk> 's pitching style relies on deception . He keeps the ball hidden so that it is hard for the batter to pick up the ball and has a consistent <unk> delivery on all of his pitches . Out of the <unk> , <unk> lowers his right foot vertically with a slight pause before moving it forward toward the plate . The motion was described during the 2015 National League Division Series as a " <unk> move " drawing comparison with one setting a <unk> on a bicycle . Out of the stretch , he uses a slide step as it makes it difficult for the base runner at first base to get a read on him . He has stated many times that he has modeled his pitching mechanics after his favorite pitcher growing up , Roger <unk> . 
 <unk> 's repertoire includes a four @-@ seam fastball that sits anywhere from 92 miles per hour ( 148 km / h ) to 95 miles per hour ( 153 km / h ) and tops out at 98 miles per hour ( 158 km / h ) with late movement , a slider at 84 miles per hour ( 135 km / h ) – 87 miles per hour ( 140 km / h ) , a 12 – 6 curveball between 72 miles per hour ( 116 km / h ) – 76 miles per hour ( 122 km / h ) , and a seldom thrown changeup ( under 3 % ) . As of late in the 2015 season , he is believed to be experimenting with the use of a cutter . He is also known for having one of the better <unk> moves to first base and is considered one of the better fielding pitchers in the game . 
 According to many teammates , <unk> is a noted <unk> . <unk> Ellis describes his preparation and <unk> during <unk> before each start : 
 <unk> grew up in Dallas , Texas and attended school with quarterback Matthew Stafford and fellow pitchers Jordan <unk> and Shawn <unk> . One of his favorite players growing up was former Texas Rangers first baseman Will Clark , and the main reason he wears number 22 is to honor Clark . 
 He is the great @-@ nephew of astronomer Clyde <unk> , the <unk> of Pluto . <unk> 's mother , born <unk> <unk> , is the daughter of Clyde <unk> 's younger brother . His father , Christopher George <unk> , was a musician and won a <unk> Award for his work . The elder <unk> remarried after his divorce from <unk> and died in 2013 . 
 On December 4 , 2010 , <unk> married his girlfriend of seven years , Ellen <unk> . On January 23 , 2015 , Ellen gave birth to the couple 's first child , daughter <unk> Ann . He is a Methodist with strong religious faith . 
 <unk> made a cameo appearance in " Prince " , a Season 3 episode of New Girl which originally aired following <unk> 's telecast of Super Bowl <unk> . 
 In addition to Hope 's Home and <unk> 's Challenge , he has also helped with other programs in Los Angeles , such as helping Habitat for <unk> <unk> and <unk> a house in <unk> , California . He is also a supporter of the <unk> Foundation , which provides animal @-@ assisted <unk> and activities for at risk youth by <unk> with mental health practitioners , public service agencies and community organizations . 
 <unk> and his wife , Ellen , co @-@ authored a book named <unk> : Live Out Your Faith and Dreams on Whatever Field You Find Yourself about their Christian faith and their humanitarian efforts . The book was released on January 10 , 2012 through <unk> Press . 
 <unk> is a celebrity <unk> for <unk> , Wilson Sporting <unk> ( <unk> ) , Under Armour ( shoes ) , <unk> Milk , and <unk> . 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> is an <unk> @-@ speaking Indigenous Australian , born around 1945 or 1953 at the Santa Teresa Mission , near Alice Springs in Australia 's Northern Territory . 
 When <unk> <unk> began painting for <unk> Gallery in central Australia , she indicated that her name was <unk> rather than <unk> , and that this was how she <unk> wished to be known ; however <unk> 's biography is the only source that has used that version of her name . 
 <unk> <unk> began painting about 1990 or 1992 as part of the contemporary Indigenous art movement that had begun at <unk> in the 1970s . By 1998 her work was being collected by both private and public institutions , such as Charles Sturt University , and in 2005 a work was purchased by the National Gallery of Victoria . Her career received a significant boost when her work was included in the National Gallery of Victoria 's 2006 Landmarks exhibition and its catalogue ; her painting was printed opposite that of <unk> Tommy Watson , who was by this time famous , particularly for his contribution to the design of a new building for the Musée du <unk> <unk> . <unk> 's paintings have been included at exhibitions in several private galleries in Melbourne and Hong Kong , as well as at the Australian embassy in Washington in 2001 . 
 In 2006 a commissioned work by <unk> was exhibited at <unk> College at the University of New South Wales as part of a charity fundraising exhibition . It sold for A $ 22 @,@ 000 . As of the end of 2008 , the highest recorded auction price for an item of <unk> 's work was $ 22 @,@ 800 , set in May 2007 . An image based on a <unk> by <unk> , Bush <unk> , appears on the cover of a book on the visual perception of motion , Motion Vision . 
 Central Australian artists frequently paint particular " <unk> " , or stories , for which they have responsibility or rights . These stories are used to pass " important knowledge , cultural values and belief systems " from generation to generation . <unk> by <unk> portray two different groups of <unk> , rendered in two distinct styles . Bush plum dreaming represents a plant of the central Australian desert which is " a source of physical and spiritual sustenance , reminding [ the local Indigenous people ] of the <unk> of [ their ] country " . These paintings are undertaken with red , blue and orange dots that represent the fruit at different stages in its development . She also paints women ’ s ceremonies ( <unk> ) and <unk> , and these are created using rows of coloured dots and include representations of women 's ceremonial iconography . 
 Journalist <unk> <unk> described <unk> as one of the " finest contemporary Aboriginal artists " . Art consultant Adrian Newstead has ranked her as amongst the country 's top 200 Indigenous artists , noting that she has become " known for innovative works that create a sense of visual harmony through fine <unk> fields of <unk> applied <unk> " . Her style is described by Indigenous art writers <unk> and <unk> as an " interesting , modern interpretation of landscape " . 
 <unk> 's work is held in a variety of public and private collections , including <unk> , the Charles Sturt University Collection , the Holmes a Court Collection , and the National Gallery of Victoria . 
 Head VI is an oil @-@ on @-@ canvas painting by the Irish @-@ born English <unk> artist Francis <unk> , the last of six panels making up his " 1949 Head " series . It shows a bust view of a single figure , modeled on Diego <unk> 's Portrait of Innocent X. <unk> applies forceful , expressive brush <unk> , and places the figure within a glass cage structure , behind curtain @-@ like <unk> . This gives the effect of a man trapped and <unk> by his surroundings , screaming into an <unk> void . 
 Head VI was the first of <unk> 's paintings to reference <unk> , whose portrait of Pope Innocent X haunted him throughout his career and inspired his series of " screaming <unk> " , a loose series of which there are around 45 surviving individual works . Head VI contains many motifs that were to reappear in <unk> 's work . The hanging object , which may be a light switch or curtain <unk> , can be found even in his late paintings . The <unk> cage is a motif that appears as late as his 1985 – 86 masterpiece , Study for a Self @-@ Portrait — <unk> . 
 Already 40 years old , <unk> viewed the exhibition as his last chance and applied himself to the task with determination . Because he had destroyed all his out of the last three years , he had little choice but to present new works . He did not have a grand plan when he agreed to the show , but eventually found themes that interested him in his Head I of the previous year , and executed five progressively stronger variants in the final weeks before the November exhibition , completing the series barely in time for the opening . 
 <unk> said that chance played a significant role in his work , and that he often approached a canvas without having a clear idea of what might emerge . This was especially the case in the mid to late 1940s , a period when he was drinking heavily and spending most nights in <unk> <unk> and poker rooms . The following morning he would often approach his canvas " in a bad mood of drinking ... under tremendous <unk> and drink ; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing . " He incorporated his appetite for chance into his work : an image often would <unk> mid @-@ way through into something quite different from what he had first intended . He actively sought out this freedom and felt it crucial to his progression as an artist . To him , lifestyle and art were intertwined ; he said that " perhaps the drink helped me to be a bit <unk> . " This is very evident in the 1949 series , which began as a rather <unk> study of a collapsed head , but evolved over the six surviving panels into a reworking of <unk> masterpieces , and arrived at an image that was to <unk> <unk> for the subsequent 20 years . 
 The series marks <unk> 's first attempt at depicting lone figures in rooms . For him , the key aspect was that it appeared that the subject felt isolated , <unk> , and had abandoned the need to present an outward face . He believed that under these circumstances all <unk> falls away , and the social being becomes the sum of its <unk> , which <unk> attempted to convey by reducing the subject to its bare @-@ bones features : a mouth , ears , eyes , a jaw . According to Russell , " the view out front ceases to be the only one , and our person is suddenly <unk> , fragmented , and subject to strange <unk> . " Russell observed that while the depiction of figures in rooms is common through all eras of painting , the figures are always posed , and usually seemingly aware that they are being portrayed . This <unk> is abandoned in <unk> 's series . 
 Head I , completed late in 1948 , is considered more successful than Head II . Although it is well @-@ regarded critically , Head II is seen as something of a creative <unk> @-@ de @-@ sac , while Heads III , IV and V are usually considered as merely intermediate steps towards Head VI . It is exceptional in <unk> 's <unk> that works of their relative poor quality survive ; he was <unk> self @-@ critical and often <unk> or abandoned <unk> before they were completed . When pressed again by <unk> in 1953 to produce works for a New York show that she had been <unk> for a year , he was full of doubt and destroyed most of what he had been working on , including several other <unk> . 
 <unk> commissioned another showing to be held in 1950 , for which <unk> painted three large <unk> modelled on <unk> 's portrait . The gallery advertised the show as " Francis <unk> : Three Studies from the Painting of Innocent X by <unk> " , but in the end <unk> was dissatisfied with the works and destroyed them before the show opened . 
 The figure is clearly identifiable as a pope from his clothing . It seems trapped and isolated within the outlines of an abstract three @-@ dimensional glass cage . This framing device , described by Sylvester as a " space @-@ frame " , was to feature heavily throughout the artist 's career . A <unk> hangs from the upper edge of the glass case , falling just in front of the pope 's face and partially covering his eyes . It is too <unk> drawn to identify with certainty , but given the presence of similar objects in <unk> 's later works , may be either the end of a hanging light switch or the <unk> of a curtain ; the hanging <unk> was to become a signature for the artist . Apart from its symbolic meaning , it has a <unk> function , framing the painting with a further set of vertical lines . Such an object reappears most prominently in the centre panel of his 1973 <unk> , May – June 1973 , where it is clearly a dangling light bulb . For <unk> , these elements were intended to make the figure <unk> in and out of sight for the viewer , alluding to the fact that bulbs can be on or off , <unk> open or closed . 
 The glass cage might imply a vacuum that the figure 's voice is unable to escape ; as if it is screaming in silence . <unk> later in life , <unk> said that he had " wanted to paint the scream more than the horror . I think , if I had really thought about what causes somebody to really scream , it would have made the scream ... more successful " . The work evokes memories of the Second World War . The glass enclosure of his 1949 Chicago Study for a Portrait is often seen as <unk> photographs of Adolf <unk> 1961 trial before a Jerusalem District Court , when he was held within a similar cage . <unk> strongly resisted literal comparisons though , and stated that he used the device so he could frame and " really see the image – for no other reason . I know it 's been interpreted as being many other things . " Other critics saw similarities between the glass case and the radio <unk> of late 1930s broadcasters who warned against the impending <unk> . Denis Farr notes that <unk> was sympathetic to George Orwell and referred in interviews to <unk> " shouting voices ... and trembling hands ... convey [ ing ] the harsh atmosphere of an <unk> . " 
 The so @-@ called " space frame " had already been used by Alberto <unk> in the 1930s , and the two artists became friends in the 1960s . However <unk> had by 1949 used it only in <unk> contexts before <unk> 's <unk> , and in turn influenced his use in " The Cage " of 1950 . A similar two dimensional construct is found in Henry Moore 's works , notably his " <unk> for King and Queen " , constructed three years after <unk> 's Head . It is difficult to <unk> how these artists influenced and informed each other . What is notable is that <unk> continued to use the motif , with intervals until the end of his life . Sylvester suggests his finest example is the 1970 Three Studies of the Male Back . 
 Head VI was first exhibited at the Hanover Gallery , London , in 1949 . It was acquired by the Arts Council 's <unk> Gallery in 1952 . The <unk> has loaned it out a number of times since , including for major <unk> at the Grand <unk> , Paris in 1971 , and the Hugh Lane Gallery , Dublin , in 2000 . 
 In May 1996 , the National Gallery took on loan <unk> 's Innocent X portrait and hung it alongside four <unk> paintings ; Head VI , Pope I ( 1951 ) , Pope 1961 and Pope 1965 . <unk> believes that <unk> would have disapproved of such a showing with a work he considered one of the finest ever painted , but writes that two , including Head VI , " stood up to it , and even enhanced its authority as one of the most penetrating studies of human nature and human power " . 
 <unk> was a movement in early 20th @-@ century Anglo @-@ American poetry that favored precision of imagery and clear , sharp language . 
 <unk> has been described as the most influential movement in English poetry since the activity of the Pre @-@ <unk> . As a poetic style it gave <unk> its start in the early 20th century , and is considered to be the first organized <unk> literary movement in the English language . <unk> is sometimes viewed as ' a succession of creative moments ' rather than any continuous or sustained period of development . René <unk> remarked that ' It is more accurate to consider <unk> not as a doctrine , nor even as a poetic school , but as the association of a few poets who were for a certain time in agreement on a small number of important principles ' . 
 The <unk> rejected the sentiment and <unk> typical of much Romantic and Victorian poetry , in contrast to their contemporaries , the Georgian poets , who were generally content to work within that tradition . In contrast , <unk> called for a return to what were seen as more Classical values , such as <unk> of presentation and economy of language , as well as a willingness to experiment with non @-@ traditional verse forms . <unk> use free verse . 
 <unk> publications appearing between 1914 and 1917 featured works by many of the most prominent modernist figures , both in poetry and in other fields . The <unk> group was centered in London , with members from Great Britain , Ireland and the United States . <unk> unusually for the time , a number of women writers were major <unk> figures . 
 A characteristic feature of <unk> is its attempt to isolate a single image to reveal its essence . This feature mirrors contemporary developments in avant @-@ garde art , especially <unk> . Although <unk> <unk> objects through the use of what Ezra Pound called " luminous details " , Pound 's <unk> Method of juxtaposing concrete instances to express an <unk> is similar to <unk> 's manner of <unk> multiple perspectives into a single image . 
 The March 1913 issue of Poetry contained A Few Don <unk> by an <unk> and the essay entitled <unk> both written by Pound , with the latter being attributed to Flint . The latter contained this <unk> statement of the group 's position : 
 As regarding rhythm : to compose in sequence of the musical phrase , not in sequence of the <unk> . 
 Pound 's note opened with a definition of an image as " that which presents an intellectual and emotional complex in an instant of time " . Pound goes on to state , " It is better to present one Image in a lifetime than to produce <unk> works " . His list of " don <unk> " reinforced his three statements in " <unk> " , while warning that they should not be considered as <unk> but as the " result of long contemplation " . Taken together , these two texts comprised the <unk> programme for a return to what they saw as the best poetic practice of the past . <unk> Flint commented " we have never claimed to have invented the moon . We do not pretend that our ideas are original . " 
 The 1916 preface to Some <unk> Poets comments " <unk> does not merely mean the presentation of pictures . <unk> refers to the manner of presentation , not to the subject . " 
 Pound 's editorial choices were based on what he saw as the degree of sympathy that these writers displayed with <unk> precepts , rather than active participation in a group as such . Williams , who was based in the United States , had not participated in any of the discussions of the <unk> Tower group . However , he and Pound had long been corresponding on the question of the renewal of poetry along similar lines . Ford was included at least partly because of his strong influence on Pound , as the younger poet made the transition from his earlier , Pre @-@ <unk> @-@ influenced style towards a harder , more modern way of writing . The inclusion of a poem by Joyce , I Hear an Army , which was sent to Pound by <unk> Yeats , took on a wider importance in the history of literary <unk> , as the subsequent correspondence between the two led to the serial publication , at Pound 's behest , of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man in The <unk> . Joyce 's poem is not written in free verse , but in rhyming <unk> . However , it strongly reflects Pound 's interest in poems written to be sung to music , such as those by the <unk> and <unk> <unk> . The book met with little popular or critical success , at least partly because it had no introduction or commentary to explain what the poets were attempting to do , and a number of copies were returned to the publisher . 
 Lowell persuaded D. H. Lawrence to contribute poems to the 1915 and 1916 volumes , making him the only writer to publish as both a Georgian poet and an <unk> . <unk> Moore also became associated with the group during this period . However , with World War I as a backdrop , the times were not easy for avant @-@ garde literary movements ( <unk> , for example , spent much of the war at the front ) , and the 1917 anthology effectively marked the end of the <unk> as a movement . 
 In 1929 , Walter <unk> <unk> suggested that <unk> should produce a new <unk> anthology . <unk> , by now a successful novelist , took up the suggestion and enlisted the help of Ford and <unk> The result was the <unk> Anthology 1930 , edited by <unk> and including all the contributors to the four earlier anthologies with the exception of Lowell , who had died , <unk> , who had disappeared , and Pound , who declined . The appearance of this anthology initiated a critical discussion of the place of the <unk> in the history of 20th @-@ century poetry . 
 Of the poets who were published in the various <unk> anthologies , Joyce , Lawrence and <unk> are now primarily remembered and read as novelists . <unk> Moore , who was at most a fringe member of the group , carved out a unique poetic style of her own that retained an <unk> concern with compression of language . William Carlos Williams developed his poetic along distinctly American lines with his variable foot and a diction he claimed was taken " from the mouths of Polish mothers " . Both Pound and <unk> turned to writing long poems , but retained much of the hard edge to their language as an <unk> legacy . Most of the other members of the group are largely forgotten outside the context of the history of <unk> . 
 Despite the movement 's short life , <unk> would deeply influence the course of modernist poetry in English . Richard <unk> , in his 1941 memoir , writes : " I think the poems of Ezra Pound , <unk> , Lawrence , and Ford <unk> Ford will continue to be read . And to a considerable extent T. S. Eliot and his followers have carried on their operations from positions won by the <unk> . " 
 On the other hand , Wallace Stevens found shortcomings in the <unk> approach : " Not all objects are equal . The vice of <unk> was that it did not recognize this . " With its demand for hardness , clarity and precision and its insistence on fidelity to appearances coupled with its rejection of irrelevant <unk> emotions <unk> had later effects that are <unk> in T. S. Eliot 's ' <unk> ' and ' Morning at the Window ' and in D. H. Lawrence 's animal and flower pieces . The rejection of conventional verse forms in the nineteen @-@ twenties owed much to the <unk> <unk> of the Georgian Poetry style . 
 Among the Beats , Gary <unk> and Allen Ginsberg in particular were influenced by the <unk> emphasis on Chinese and Japanese poetry . William Carlos Williams was another who had a strong effect on the Beat poets , encouraging poets like Lew Welch and writing an introduction for the book publication of Ginsberg 's <unk> ( 1955 ) . 
 Operation Eastern Exit was the <unk> given to the military evacuation of the United States embassy in Mogadishu , the capital of Somalia , in January 1991 . In late December 1990 , violence quickly enveloped the city as armed militants began <unk> with government soldiers . On 1 January 1991 , the US Ambassador to Somalia , James <unk> Bishop , contacted the Department of State requesting an evacuation of the embassy , which was approved the following day . United States Central Command began planning and <unk> forces that evening . The initial plan was to evacuate with a military transport plane through the Mogadishu International Airport , but this was later abandoned . A helicopter evacuation via the USS Guam and USS <unk> was the remaining option . 
 On the morning of 5 January , a 60 @-@ person Marine and Navy <unk> security detail was dispatched from Guam aboard two CH @-@ <unk> Super <unk> helicopters to secure the embassy and prepare for the main evacuation . The two helicopters returned to Guam with the first 61 <unk> . Throughout the day , foreign diplomats and civilians sought refuge at the embassy . Four waves of five CH @-@ 46 Sea Knight helicopters each evacuated the embassy compound shortly after midnight on 6 January . The <unk> were transported to Muscat , Oman , where they disembarked on 11 January . In total , 281 diplomats and civilians from 30 countries were evacuated , including 12 heads of missions ( eight ambassadors and four <unk> d <unk> ) . 
 In the late 1980s , there was increasing rebellion against the rule of Somali President Siad Barre , a military dictator who maintained tight control of power and had a record of human rights abuses . By 1990 , what began as civil disobedience evolved into a civil war , with several militias organized to overthrow the central government . 
 In July 1989 , the embassy moved to a new , 80 @-@ acre ( 32 ha ) compound , 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) from the previous embassy and James K. Bishop was appointed as the United States ' ambassador to Somalia . Ambassador Bishop had significant experience in crisis management at US embassies . In 1967 , he was at the US Embassy in Beirut , Lebanon when the Six @-@ Day War erupted . About 3 @,@ 600 Americans were evacuated in 33 hours ; Bishop was one of 26 diplomats and soldiers that remained in the city . As deputy assistant secretary of state for Africa from 1981 – 87 , Bishop chaired several task forces for <unk> and gained experience in the State Department 's operations center as <unk> were carried out during several coups d <unk> . During his previous assignment as Ambassador to <unk> ( 1987 – 90 ) , Bishop was overseeing the voluntary evacuation of embassy staff and civilians as a civil war in <unk> spread , when he left in March 1990 . Soon after returning to Washington to prepare for his new appointment to Somalia , he was appointed to a <unk> to deal with the crisis in <unk> , which included a gradual evacuation of American civilians and a rapid closure of the embassy in August . 
 On 1 August , before leaving the US to take up his post in Mogadishu , Ambassador Bishop visited United States Central Command — the military command for the Middle East and northeast Africa — where he spent most of the day with its commander , Gen. Norman <unk> . Ambassador Bishop , aware of the ongoing <unk> , believed " the odds were better than even that we would have to leave Mogadishu under less than favorable circumstances . " Ambassador Bishop understood from his past experiences in Beirut and <unk> the importance of being prepared to deal with <unk> and spent the afternoon working with military experts to review the embassy 's <unk> and <unk> ( E & E ) plan until he was " satisfied ... that [ Central Command ] realized that it might have to conduct an evacuation from Mogadishu and was prepared to do that . " In its analysis of Operation Eastern Exit , the Center for Naval Analyses cited the Ambassador Bishop 's previous experience and " clear understanding of his role " in the operation as one of the reasons Operation Eastern Exit went so well . 
 <unk> after Ambassador Bishop 's visit to Central Command , Iraq invaded Kuwait . In 1979 , the US negotiated access to an airport and port in both Mogadishu and <unk> ; because of limited access the US had to locations in the Persian Gulf area , maintaining this access was a main interest for the Mogadishu embassy to pursue as the US mobilized to intervene in Kuwait . 
 An increasing level of criminal violence prompted Ambassador Bishop to request the voluntary evacuation of dependents ( e.g. children and spouses of staff ) and non @-@ essential staff in early December , although fighting between the government and the United Somali Congress ( a rebel militia ) remained no less than about 100 miles ( 160 km ) away . The voluntary evacuation later became a mandatory evacuation . By 19 December , the number of official US personnel in the city was reduced from 147 to 37 ; around the same time , fighting between the government and rebels came within about 40 miles ( 64 km ) of Mogadishu . 
 On 30 December , violence escalated " an order of magnitude " as militants entered Mogadishu , which was quickly enveloped by a general state of lawlessness . On 30 – 31 December , diplomats , including many stationed in offices elsewhere in the city , were collected and housed in the embassy compound , except two volunteers who remained in the embassy 's K @-@ 7 residential apartments located across <unk> Road from the embassy . The volunteers in the K @-@ 7 building would be needed as look @-@ outs for the embassy compound 's main gate . On the morning of 31 December , the defense <unk> was nearly killed when his vehicle was <unk> with bullets and that evening , a soldier at a roadblock shot the <unk> of a vehicle carrying another defense official . Attempts by the US and other nations ' diplomats , in particular the Italian embassy , to negotiate a ceasefire for foreigners to leave were unsuccessful . <unk> Road became a " shooting gallery , " preventing those in safe @-@ <unk> outside the embassy from reaching it . On New Year 's Day , the first American civilians began to seek refuge at the embassy . 
 Ambassador Bishop requested an evacuation of the American community on 1 January , indicating that the evacuation could be with the planned Italian , French , or German evacuation efforts , but preferred an evacuation by the US military . The State Department authorized the evacuation on 2 January and on that day , Ambassador Bishop specifically requested an evacuation by the US military , thereby initiating Operation Eastern Exit . Ambassador Bishop had spent a considerable amount of time discussing <unk> plans for evacuation with other diplomatic posts . Ultimately , ten heads of missions — eight ambassadors and two <unk> d <unk> — along with their staff sought refuge in the US embassy compound and were evacuated . 
 Ambassador Bishop had visited Central Command in August 1990 , where he worked with military experts to update the embassy 's E & E plan . The first notice that an evacuation of the Mogadishu embassy would be needed came on the morning of 1 January , when the top naval commander at Central Command sent a message to his naval operations staff : " Better have <unk> crowd take a look at a <unk> <unk> of Mogadishu ! time / distance to get there from <unk> <unk> area . " Following the ambassador 's 2 January evacuation request , the commander of Central Command ordered Air Force aircraft to the region , the movement of amphibious ships to Mogadishu , and requested United States Special Operations Command to prepare for a noncombatant evacuation operation . 
 The initial plan was to evacuate via Mogadishu International Airport . Soon after the evacuation request , the United States Air Force deployed C @-@ 130 transport planes and an AC @-@ 130 , for gunfire support , to <unk> , Kenya , awaiting clearances to enter Somalia and the ability to safely transfer <unk> from the embassy to the airport . However , the US and other foreign embassies were unable to contact anyone within the government to obtain clearances . It also became apparent that the rebels had an ineffective command @-@ and @-@ control structure , making it impossible to negotiate any ceasefire or guarantee of safe passage . Likewise , government troops faced a command @-@ and @-@ control problem ; reports indicated that army units were separating along clan lines , in some cases soldiers shot officers of a different clan when given orders they disagreed with . Thus , it became clear that safe passage to the airport would not be possible . Several other nations also had aircraft mobilized to reach Mogadishu , but faced the same problems of landing and transit of <unk> to the airport . 
 On 4 January , several incidents , including a couple exchanges of gunfire , suggested that the embassy 's security detail was insufficient to hold off armed <unk> until the USS Guam and USS <unk> arrived with their helicopters and soldiers , at that time scheduled to arrive on 7 January . The embassy had just six Marine guards , whose job was limited to protecting the <unk> . Ambassador Bishop made an urgent request to Washington for two platoons of soldiers to parachute into the embassy to defend it until the ships arrived . The request was denied , but the Ambassador was told that an advance element from the vessels would reach the embassy the following morning . 
 USS Guam and USS <unk> began transit from the coast of Oman towards Mogadishu at 22 : 30 ( 23 : 30 Oman time ) on 2 January . The commander of <unk> Group Two had initially proposed a seven @-@ ship <unk> Task Group , composed of vessels anchored at <unk> Island ( off Oman ) and Dubai and including four amphibious ships so that the full range of amphibious capabilities would be available for the operation . However , intervention in Kuwait seemed imminent and the commander of naval forces at Central Command did not want to divert that many ships from the Persian Gulf , thus the decision to send two of the closest ships . Although the two vessels were selected by mid @-@ afternoon on 2 January , the transfer of some personnel from Dubai to <unk> caused a delay of eight to ten hours . Guam and <unk> carried forces from the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade , including a detachment of CH @-@ <unk> Super <unk> helicopters — the largest helicopters operated by the US military — and two squadrons of CH @-@ 46 Sea Knight helicopters . 
 Planning began in earnest as the ships got underway , with a combined command center on Guam . On the morning of 3 January , the task force 's command questioned why they were not given the option of an amphibious landing and requested a tank landing ship be added to the task force ; the request was denied . A warrant officer who had previously served as a Marine Security Guard at the Mogadishu embassy during the mid @-@ 1980s was found . Despite Ambassador Bishop 's planning with Central Command , the task force was provided outdated information . The former <unk> told planners that a new embassy had been planned and was under construction several years prior . In fact , the new embassy was located further inland and , after receiving updated information , task force commanders determined that a beach landing , requiring troops to fight their way across the city , was too risky . Initial plans had the ships launch their helicopters at 01 : 00 on 7 January . However , in response to indications from Ambassador Bishop that conditions in Mogadishu were deteriorating , planners considered 1 @,@ 050 @-@ nautical @-@ mile ( 1 @,@ 940 km ; 1 @,@ 210 mi ) and , later , 890 @-@ nautical @-@ mile ( 1 @,@ 650 km ; 1 @,@ 020 mi ) flights with the CH @-@ <unk> while the ships were still located in the northern Arabian Sea . The situation in Mogadishu stabilized somewhat and the mission was delayed until 5 January . 
 On the evening of 4 January , the final execute order was issued for a 02 : 45 launch of two CH @-@ <unk> Super <unk> to arrive at the embassy at dawn . The 60 soldiers selected for the security detail were issued weapons and ammunition . Two Marine Corps <unk> @-@ 130 <unk> tankers were mobilized closer to the operation , from Bahrain to Oman , to refuel the helicopters en route to Mogadishu and the two helicopters transferred from <unk> to Guam . 
 The security detail moved to establish a perimeter around the embassy compound and the Air Force 's AC @-@ 130 arrived to provide overhead support . Ambassador Bishop gave the security detail clear instructions on the rules of engagement : they could only use deadly force if people came over the embassy compound 's walls with obvious hostile intent . He also identified three zones of defense , stating a preference to retreat to the third zone before the use of deadly force : 
 the Chancery , Joint Administrative Office ( <unk> ) building , Marine House , and the helicopter landing zone ( <unk> ) 
 Ambassador Bishop clearly explained his rationale to the security detail , which was to avoid any impression that they were intervening in the violence in Mogadishu . He feared that the embassy would be targeted by organized attacks if any group involved in the clashes got the impression that the US was intervening in the conflict . To this effect , he requested the Voice of America and BBC broadcast announcements that the forces were present only to evacuate the embassy and would not interfere in the conflict . The Marines who had been <unk> in fuel during the <unk> were able to take a shower and wash their clothes . 
 After an hour on the ground , the helicopters left with the first 61 <unk> , including all American civilians and four heads of mission . <unk> were provided blankets on one of the flights to remain warm . <unk> with the only in @-@ flight <unk> on the return nearly prevented <unk> , which would have forced the helicopters to divert to the Somali desert and await a rescue . At 9 : 40 , the helicopters arrived on Guam and <unk> the <unk> . 
 No threats came upon the embassy during the day , although <unk> of armed <unk> frequently drove by the embassy along <unk> Road . Only one incident seemed to directly target the embassy . A sniper and a <unk> were positioned on the embassy 's water tower ( the highest structure in the compound ) and came under fire ; they were ordered to not return fire and soon thereafter ordered to leave their position on the water tower . 
 The Office of Military Cooperation , just one and a half blocks from the embassy , required evacuation . Despite its proximity to the embassy , an armed convoy was needed to evacuate persons trapped there by the unrest . A convoy of vehicles with several Marines and <unk> left the embassy at 8 : 47 and returned ten minutes later with 22 persons from the <unk> ( four Americans , a <unk> , and 17 <unk> ) . This was the only <unk> outside the embassy by the security detail . Throughout the day , foreign diplomats contacted the embassy <unk> to be evacuated ; the US welcomed these requests , but required all of them to find their own transportation to the embassy . 
 A Somali officer who had a previous relationship with the embassy , Major Siad , agreed to travel to rescue the German <unk> d <unk> and British ambassador ( junior staff from the British embassy had previously come to the US embassy ) . The Soviet Union was unable to land a plane in Mogadishu the previous day and the Soviet ambassador asked Ambassador Bishop if he and his staff could be rescued ; Ambassador Bishop , a tennis partner of his Soviet counterpart , agreed but only if they found their own way to the embassy . Seeing the helicopters on the morning of 5 January , they realized the Americans would not remain in the city much longer . At the request of Ambassador Bishop , Major Siad agreed to transport the Soviets , but only if he was paid enough ; the US embassy paid Major Siad , who returned with the Soviet ambassador and 38 of his staff . The brother of President Barre , who was also a Major General and Chief of Police , showed up at the embassy in the afternoon with 25 members of his family requesting to be evacuated , but was turned away after a vocal conversation with the ambassador . 
 The operation did not include soldiers to handle the evacuation control center ( <unk> ) , which was set up in the <unk> . A 44 @-@ person force consisting primarily of soldiers to handle the <unk> was planned for insertion with the CH @-@ <unk> Super <unk> after they had returned to the Guam . However , this was cancelled over objections from the commander of the security detail . The deficit was partially handled by embassy staff who assisted a few soldiers from the security detail . The <unk> were grouped into 15 @-@ person " sticks " to be loaded onto the helicopters and were limited to one piece of luggage apiece . Some attempted to bring more , resulting in problems coordinating their evacuation . Furthermore , many <unk> had pets they wanted to bring , which were not allowed . Most pets were killed by their owners ; some were given poison . Meanwhile , the soldiers were allowed to consume anything they wanted from the embassy 's <unk> , such as candy , <unk> , and souvenirs ( most had been stationed on ships for several months ) . They were also allowed use or take anything they needed from the embassy ; the <unk> filled several bags with medical supplies to return to the ship . 
 As evening approached , work began to prepare the <unk> for the main evacuation . The area was used as a parking lot and several vehicles were left without keys by staff that had already been evacuated . Some cars had to be broken into to be moved . Chemical lights were placed in the <unk> in a NATO " Y " pattern . The entire mission would be conducted with night vision <unk> , which required all lights in the embassy compound to be turned off . 
 The main evacuation occurred in the early morning hours of 6 January and consisted of four waves of five CH @-@ 46 helicopters . The timing of this phase was determined by range of the CH @-@ 46 Sea Knight , which lack aerial <unk> capability ; the ships were about 350 – 380 nautical miles ( 650 – 700 km ; 400 – 440 mi ) away during this phase . An AC @-@ 130 was sent from Saudi Arabia to provide gunfire support during the evacuation and two <unk> @-@ 1 Iroquois helicopters were on standby to provide gunfire support , but were not deployed . 
 The first wave departed Guam at 23 : 43 . As the second wave landed , Major Siad arrived at the embassy gate accompanied by two <unk> of soldiers and held a grenade in one hand and a radio in the other . His request to speak with the ambassador was granted . Major Siad demanded that the evacuation cease immediately because the Somali government had not granted the US permission to carry out such a military operation . He claimed that he would radio soldiers to shoot down the helicopters if the operation continued . The second and third waves were able to depart without incident as the ambassador negotiated with the Major , who finally agreed to settle the matter for several thousand dollars in cash and keys to the ambassador 's armored car . Ambassador Bishop remained engaged in conversation with the Major until he reached the helicopter landing zone to depart with the final wave to prevent the Major from <unk> on the deal . The final wave departed the embassy at 1 : 49 and landed on Guam at 2 : 23 ; twenty minutes later , Ambassador Bishop declared the evacuation complete . 
 Armed <unk> were observed entering the embassy compound as the final wave departed . The doors of the <unk> — the main building of the embassy — were reportedly blown open by <unk> within two hours of the embassy 's evacuation . Somali employees of the embassy — known as foreign service <unk> ( <unk> ) — could not be evacuated . Ambassador Bishop tried unsuccessfully to have these employees <unk> to safer parts of Somalia . Many of the <unk> had sought refuge in the embassy with their families and about 30 were hired as guards and protected the embassy throughout the ordeal . Local banks had been closed for some time and the embassy was unable to pay the <unk> . The Ambassador left the <unk> with keys to the <unk> and warehouse on the embassy compound and they were permitted to take anything they needed . 
 A total of 281 <unk> were taken from the embassy , including 12 heads of missions ( eight ambassadors and four <unk> d <unk> ) and 61 Americans ( including Ambassador Bishop and 36 embassy staff ) . The heads of mission were the ambassadors of the United States , Kenya , Nigeria , Soviet Union , Sudan , Turkey , United Arab Emirates , and United Kingdom and the <unk> of the embassies of Germany , Kuwait , Oman , and <unk> . 
 Rather than disembark in nearby <unk> , as originally thought by the <unk> , the ships were ordered back to Oman — a five @-@ day journey . The sailors and marines made way for the <unk> to share living quarters . When the <unk> of Guam asked crew to sign up as guides for the <unk> while aboard the vessel , two hundred signed up within an hour , and some of the sailors even dressed up as <unk> to ease the ordeal for children . At the request of the ambassadors , a formal session with the ships ' senior officers was held to express their thanks . On 11 January , the <unk> were <unk> at Muscat , Oman . That afternoon , the American <unk> were flown to Frankfurt , Germany , from where they continued home . 
 The 2010 <unk> Shield was the 57th <unk> Shield tournament , the premier baseball competition in Australia , and was held from 6 November 2009 to 7 February 2010 . It was hailed as the precursor to the new Australian Baseball League that will start in the place of the <unk> Shield in late 2010 to early 2011 . The Victoria <unk> defeated South Australia two games to nil in the championship series to win the tournament ; this was the 22nd time the <unk> Shield had been awarded to a Victorian team . The competition was sponsored by <unk> 's <unk> . 
 At the conclusion of the regular season , the Victoria <unk> finished in first place with a 17 – 7 record , earning home @-@ field advantage for the three @-@ game championship series . South Australia hosted the three @-@ game semi @-@ final series against the New South Wales <unk> . Both teams finished with a 14 – 10 record . The Perth Heat ( 12 – 12 ) and Queensland <unk> ( 3 – 21 ) both failed to qualify for the finals . 
 In June 2009 , it was announced that the rights to the <unk> Shield had been sold to a new Australian Baseball League ( <unk> ) , with ownership split between Major League Baseball 's 75 percent share and the 25 percent share owned by the Australian Baseball Federation . The 2010 tournament was considered preparation for the inaugural <unk> season starting in 2010 – 11 . It varied from the 2009 <unk> Shield by expanding the season to include ten rounds . Since an uneven number ( five ) teams were involved , four teams paired off for each round and played a three @-@ game series , while the remaining team took a bye . During the season , each team had two bye rounds and played two rounds against each other team , one at home and one away . In total , the schedule allowed for 24 regular @-@ season games per team before a postseason similar to the 2009 edition : the first @-@ place team directly qualified for the championship series and played against the winner of a playoff series between the second- and third @-@ place teams . 
 During the regular season , games were played on a Friday night and a <unk> on Saturday ; in each <unk> one of the two games was shortened to seven innings . The exception to this was when Perth played their home games ; they played on a Thursday night instead of a <unk> on Saturday . Each postseason series was scheduled for a Friday , Saturday and Sunday . 
 The 2010 series allowed each team to make use of a 19 @-@ man active roster . <unk> were made in two cases that allowed teams ' active <unk> to expand to 21 players , both times for the same reason . Two games during the season had to be postponed because of poor weather . Both games involved teams meeting for the first time during the season ; make @-@ up games were scheduled at the start of the return series between the teams , and this resulted in two four @-@ game series . In both cases , the teams had a 19 @-@ man roster for the make @-@ up game , and an expanded 21 @-@ man roster for the originally scheduled series . 
 The 2010 <unk> Shield was contested between five teams from around Australia . In previous years , many of the teams had played their home games at multiple venues . This season each team held their home games at only one venue . There was one scheduled exception to this at the start of the season : the New South Wales <unk> ' final home series against the Perth Heat was held at Gilchrist Oval , whereas all of their other home games were held at <unk> Baseball Stadium . 
 As a result of poor attendance at <unk> Baseball Park , game one of the fifth @-@ round series between New South Wales and the Victoria <unk> was moved to La <unk> University , Melbourne . Although the <unk> games had attracted crowds of no more than 500 , the moved game had an attendance of 2 @,@ 200 . Though no further regular season games were moved , the finals series hosted by the <unk> was held at La <unk> University as well . 
 † — A game postponed from Round 7 , held in Round 8 , was played with Victoria <unk> as the away team and Queensland <unk> as the home team , despite being played at <unk> Baseball Park , <unk> , Victoria . 
 <unk> — A game postponed from Round 3 , held in Round 9 , was played with South Australia as the away team and Victoria <unk> as the home team , despite being played at Norwood Oval , Adelaide , South Australia . 
 The Queensland <unk> were the first team to be eliminated from contention for the finals , after being swept four games to nil by the Victoria <unk> in round 8 . The following round saw South Australia clinch a position in the finals , despite finishing the round in second position . It was not until the final round that the last two spots in the finals were decided : the <unk> clinched top spot by sweeping the Perth Heat , which combined with the New South Wales <unk> sweep of the <unk> eliminated Perth from contention and secured the last finals spot for the <unk> . 
 The 2010 <unk> Shield made use of the same finals structure as had been used in the 2009 season . The top three teams at the conclusion of the ten rounds of regular @-@ season games qualified . The second- and third @-@ place teams faced in each other in a best @-@ of @-@ three series hosted by the second @-@ place team . The winner of that series then faced the first @-@ place team for a best @-@ of @-@ three series . South Australia hosted the New South Wales <unk> at Norwood Oval , Adelaide , while the Victoria <unk> hosted the championship series at La <unk> University , Melbourne . In the finals , the home team and away team alternated during each of the series . As a result , South Australia was officially the away team for game two of its series against New South Wales , as was Victoria in the championship series . 
 After defeating the <unk> two games to one in the semi @-@ final series , South Australia progressed to the championship series against the <unk> . There they were defeated two games to nil . After game two of the championship series , Victoria 's Matthew <unk> was named both <unk> Shield Final Series MVP and Pitcher of the Year . 
 At the conclusion of the finals series , the winner of two awards were announced . Matthew <unk> won both the Pitcher of the Year award and the Finals Series MVP award . At the Baseball Australia Diamond Awards , held on 6 March at the Hotel Grand Chancellor , Adelaide , Wayne <unk> was announced as the 35th winner of the Helms Award ; the <unk> Shield 's Most Valuable Player award . <unk> was the first pitcher to win since 1986 . Runners @-@ up by two votes were Paul <unk> and Michael Collins . 
 <unk> is the thirteenth Spanish @-@ language studio album by <unk> singer @-@ songwriter Ricardo <unk> , released on 23 September 2011 . Recorded in the United States and Mexico , it was produced by <unk> with Dan Warner , Lee Levin and Puerto <unk> singer @-@ songwriter Tommy Torres . The album — the first independent release by <unk> after he was signed by Sony Music in 1993 and Warner Music in 2008 — was issued by his own label , <unk> . 
 <unk> and written in a year , the record marks <unk> and Torres ' fourth collaboration . For <unk> , <unk> returns to his trademark sound after his stylistic departure for <unk> <unk> ( 2010 ) . While producing the latter , he had used fewer instruments to <unk> his sound , having introduced what had been called a " stripped @-@ down acoustic effort " in his music . <unk> has been compared to his earlier recordings , <unk> ( 1994 ) and Animal <unk> ( 1993 ) . 
 <unk> became <unk> 's fourth number @-@ one album on the Billboard Top Latin Albums where it debuted for the week ending 22 October 2011 . For thirteen non @-@ consecutive weeks it topped the Latin Pop Albums chart , and reached number one on the Mexican Albums Chart . It is his fifth consecutive album to chart on the Billboard 200 ( reaching number sixty @-@ five ) , and his fourth album to chart in Spain ( peaking at number sixty @-@ eight ) . Within one week after its release <unk> was certified gold in Chile , the United States and Mexico and certified platinum in Venezuela and Argentina . 
 <unk> was first digitally released in some South American countries on 23 September 2011 as a special edition , dubbed the <unk> Sur Edition . This version included a different mix of " <unk> " . On 30 September , the digital download for the standard edition of the album was released in several Latin American and European countries . On 4 October , the album was officially released as a digital download and compact disc in most of these same markets as well as North America ; an iTunes edition was released as a digital download on the iTunes music store . This version included an album @-@ only video , entitled " <unk> " . In Germany , the album was first available on the <unk> label on 4 October and on 11 October through Warner Music . In Canada and Spain , the compact @-@ disc version of the album was available on 25 October . 
 Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that " <unk> is one of Latin pop ’ s finest <unk> : <unk> , <unk> , sometimes <unk> , sometimes melancholy and especially fond of the play of opposites " . He added , " unlike some of his fellow Latin pop stars , Mr. <unk> is no saccharine lover boy " . The tour broke records for ticket sales , commercial gross and attendance . In Buenos Aires it was the most popular show at <unk> Stadium , with a total attendance of more than 160 @,@ 000 for four consecutive sold @-@ out concerts . In Guatemala City <unk> was the first artist with two consecutive sold @-@ out concerts at <unk> Flores Stadium , with a combined attendance of more than 50 @,@ 000 . As of October 2012 , the tour has been performed for close to one million people in more than eight countries . 
 <unk> was certified platinum by the Argentine Chamber of <unk> and <unk> <unk> in recognition of 40 @,@ 000 copies sold . It was also certified gold and platinum by the Mexican Association of <unk> of <unk> and <unk> for 90 @,@ 000 copies shipped . In the United States , <unk> was certified Latin platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for 100 @,@ 000 copies shipped . In Venezuela , the album was certified double platinum for more than 40 @,@ 000 copies sold . It was certified gold in Chile for 5 @,@ 000 copies shipped , and in Colombia for 10 @,@ 000 copies sold . As of November 2012 , <unk> has sold 75 @,@ 000 copies in the United States . 
 The 2003 Pacific typhoon season was a slightly below average <unk> period of tropical cyclogenesis exhibiting the development of 31 tropical depressions , of which 21 became named storms ; of those , 14 became <unk> . Though every month with the exception of February and March featured tropical activity , most storms developed from May through October . During the season , tropical cyclones affected the Philippines , Japan , China , the Korean Peninsula , Indochina , and various islands in the western Pacific . 
 The scope of this article is limited to the Pacific Ocean , north of the equator and west of the International Date Line . Storms that form east of the date line and north of the equator are called hurricanes ; see 2003 Pacific hurricane season . Tropical Storms formed in the entire west Pacific basin are assigned a name by the Tokyo Typhoon Center . Tropical depressions in this basin monitored by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) have the " W " <unk> added to their number . Tropical depressions that enter or form in the Philippine area of responsibility are assigned a name by the Philippine <unk> , <unk> and Astronomical Services Administration or PAGASA . This can often result in the same storm having two names . 
 On March 5 , 2003 , <unk> from the University College London at the Tropical Storm Risk ( <unk> ) <unk> issued an extended range forecast for the typhoon season , noting the likelihood of near average tropical cyclone activity as a result of projected neutral sea surface temperatures . The forecast indicated the potential for 26 @.@ 2 tropical storms , compared to the 10 – and 30 @-@ year average of 27 @.@ 8 and 26 @.@ 3 storms , respectively . The following month , the group raised their forecast for tropical storms to 26 @.@ 7 , indicating a slightly above average season . Over next two months , however , fluctuations in sea surface temperatures , particularly those in the Central Pacific , caused the group to revise their predictions downward and indicated the probability for a slightly below average typhoon season in their June forecast . A rise in sea surface temperatures in the following months prompted the forecasting group to once again raise their <unk> to indicate a near @-@ average season in their final August forecast update , which predicted 27 tropical storms . The group was very accurate in their <unk> , with their April and August <unk> being the most accurate . 
 Similarly , <unk> working with the City University of Hong Kong issued a seasonal projection on April 24 , 2003 , indicating the likelihood of a normal or below normal season with 29 total tropical cyclones , 26 tropical storms , and 16 <unk> . As with the <unk> , the group primarily based their forecast numbers on the prevailing status of the El Niño @-@ Southern <unk> . The City University of Hong Kong revised their <unk> on June 24 , 2003 , indicating a slight increase of total tropical cyclones to 30 . The group was also accurate in their <unk> for the entirety of the Northwest Pacific , though their specialized <unk> for the South China Sea were substantially off . 
 During the year , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) issued advisories on tropical cyclones west of the International Date Line to the Malay Peninsula , and north of the equator ; this was due to the agency 's status as the official Regional <unk> Meteorological Center , as designated by the World Meteorological Organization in 1989 . The JMA issued <unk> and analyses four times a day , beginning at 0000 UTC and continuing every six hours . The JMA issued <unk> based on a <unk> tropical cyclone forecast model . The agency estimated 10 minute sustained winds and barometric pressure based on the Dvorak technique and numerical weather prediction . The JTWC also issued warnings on storms within the basin , operating from Pearl Harbor in Hawaii to represent the interests of the United States Armed Forces in the Indian and Pacific <unk> . 
 Throughout the season , sea surface temperatures within the western equatorial Pacific were above normal , including those in the South China Sea . Areas of convection persisted year @-@ round in the lower latitudes , particularly around the Philippines . <unk> divergence was also prevalent in the same regions , resulting in enhanced tropical cyclogenesis east of the Philippines in 2003 ; the mean region of development of tropical systems during the year was more southwest than the 1971 – 2000 30 @-@ year average . In 2003 , the JMA monitored 21 tropical cyclones of at least tropical storm intensity ; of those , 14 reached typhoon intensity . Though the number of tropical storms was below average , the ratio between tropical storms and <unk> was 66 % greater than normal . The Philippine <unk> , <unk> and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) monitored three additional cyclones of at least tropical storm intensity that were not monitored by the JMA . 
 The season began with the formation of Tropical Storm <unk> on January 15 . After its <unk> five days later , no tropical cyclones of at least tropical storm intensity developed over the next two months . This period of inactivity ended with the formation of Typhoon <unk> in mid @-@ April ; <unk> was one of the longest lived Pacific storms on record and was the first typhoon with 1 @-@ minute sustained winds of at least 240 km / h ( 150 mph ) in April since Typhoon Isa in 1997 . Tropical activity was enhanced from May to June , and during this period the JMA monitored four tropical storms , while the PAGASA monitored a fifth storm off the eastern Philippines . Three of the four tropical storms monitored by the JMA approached or hit Japan , including Typhoon <unk> , which brought heavy rainfall and wind across the <unk> Islands and the Korean Peninsula . 
 Tropical activity once again declined towards the second half of June and first half of July . The second half of July , however , featured the development of <unk> Imbudo and <unk> , which both tracked westward across the Philippines before striking areas near <unk> and other regions of southeastern China . Imbudo caused the deaths of 78 people and US $ <unk> million in damage . August was a highly active month for tropical cyclogenesis , with a total of six tropical storms monitored by the JMA , JTWC , and PAGASA . This included <unk> <unk> and <unk> , which also struck southeastern China . Typhoon <unk> earlier in the month made landfall in Japan , resulting in 17 deaths . 
 <unk> was somewhat below average in September , with only one tropical cyclone making landfall , <unk> . However , <unk> was the strongest tropical cyclone of the season and was the costliest with roughly US $ 4 @.@ 8 billion in damage , mostly in South Korea . Tropical cyclogenesis and activity continued to decline after August , with October featuring only three tropical storms . However , two , <unk> and <unk> , reached typhoon intensity ; both stayed away from land . November featured less storms but was <unk> average , with two <unk> developing . The second typhoon , <unk> , devastated portions of Yap State , resulting in approximately $ 1 @.@ 7 million in damage . In December , the JTWC and PAGASA monitored a sole tropical system east of the Philippines , though the JMA did not monitor or classify any tropical cyclones during the month . 
 In storm information below , wind @-@ speed advisories differ from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) to the JMA as the JTWC uses the United States criteria of 1 @-@ minute mean to designate maximum sustained winds , while the JMA uses the 10 @-@ minute mean wind criteria to designate tropical cyclone maximum sustained winds . This difference generally results in JTWC maximum winds appearing higher than the maximum winds described by the JMA for the same cyclone . 
 On January 11 , the JTWC began monitoring the disturbance that would eventually develop into <unk> near the International Date Line . As the system tracked westward , it gradually moved into a more favorable environment for tropical cyclogenesis . On January 14 , surface observations indicated that the low @-@ pressure area had developed a closed , low @-@ level circulation center indicative of a tropical cyclone , satellite imagery remained inconclusive . Nonetheless , the JMA classified the pressure area as a tropical depression west of the Marshall Islands at 0600 UTC on January 15 . The JTWC would follow suit by classifying the storm as such at 1800 UTC later that day . At the time , the depression was tracking west @-@ northwest under the influence of a subtropical ridge to the north . Over the next day the system <unk> in convective activity before resuming its previous track and accelerating . At 0000 UTC on January 17 , the JTWC upgraded the system to tropical storm intensity , though the storm remained <unk> as the JMA continued to classify it as a tropical depression . 
 Throughout January 17 the tropical storm would again <unk> in strength , resulting in a brief <unk> by the JTWC to tropical depression intensity . However , an increase in deep convection resulted in its <unk> as a tropical storm at 1800 UTC that day , followed by the JMA upgrading the system to tropical storm intensity at 1200 UTC on January 18 . As such , the storm received the name <unk> . At roughly the same time , the tropical cyclone began to stall east of the Mariana Islands and curve sharply northeastward . Whilst the JTWC indicated that <unk> peaked in strength late on January 18 with 1 @-@ minute sustained winds of 60 km / h ( 37 mph ) , the JMA considered the system to have maintained the same intensity throughout its stint as a tropical storm . <unk> by the same nearby subtropical ridge , <unk> would continue to track towards the northeast into a less favorable tropical cyclone environment . The JMA downgraded <unk> to tropical depression at 1200 UTC on January 20 before the storm transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as its low @-@ level circulation center <unk> from the primary mass of convection due to strong wind shear . At 0000 UTC , both the JTWC and JMA discontinued the monitoring of <unk> . 
 <unk> on May 18 , the JTWC began to monitor an area of persistent disturbed weather associated with a broad low @-@ pressure area southwest of <unk> . Within highly <unk> conditions , the disturbance quickly organized and became classified as a tropical depression at 0000 UTC the following day . In its initial stages , the depression tracked slowly <unk> . However , a <unk> trough forced a weakness in a nearby ridge , allowing for the storm to take a more streamlined , northward path . At 1200 UTC on May 20 , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Chan @-@ <unk> . Following the system 's naming , Chan @-@ <unk> temporarily meandered towards the northwest before resuming its northeasterly track . The next day , the storm began to develop an eye ; this was reflected with an upgrade by the JMA to typhoon status at 0600 UTC on May 23 . <unk> intensification followed , and at 1800 UTC that day Chan @-@ <unk> reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 155 km / h ( 100 mph ) and a minimum pressure of 940 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 76 inHg ) . 
 Tropical Storm <unk> developed as a tropical depression just off the western coast of Luzon on May 25 . The disturbance quickly intensified to reach tropical storm intensity a few hours after cyclogenesis . However , intensification leveled off as <unk> executed a small clockwise loop before a subsequent landfall on Luzon on May 27 . Due to land interaction the storm temporarily weakened and <unk> before reforming in the Philippine Sea . Afterwards <unk> began <unk> and reached its peak intensity on May 29 with maximum sustained winds of 100 km / h ( 65 mph ) and a barometric pressure of 980 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 94 inHg ) . Following its peak the tropical storm began to deteriorate and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on May 30 ; these extratropical remnants continued to track northward through Japan before dissipating in the Sea of <unk> on June 4 . 
 In late May , an area of disturbed weather began to persist in the South China Sea . The JTWC began to monitor the storm cluster on May 29 . The following day , the JMA reclassified the system as a tropical depression ; initially the system remained highly disorganized due to the lack of deep convection . <unk> moderate wind shear and dry air prevented the cyclone from strengthening significantly in the storm 's early stages . These conditions <unk> as the depression tracked northeast , and at 0000 UTC on June 1 , the JMA upgraded the system to Tropical Storm <unk> . Throughout the course of the day , <unk> continued to strengthen as it accelerated northeast , and peaked in strength with a barometric pressure of 985 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 09 inHg ) and maximum sustained winds of 95 km / h ( 60 mph ) , making it a severe tropical storm . 
 However , upon moving through the <unk> Channel , conditions began to deteriorate due to increased wind shear , weakening the system and resulting in its <unk> to tropical depression status by the JMA at 1200 UTC on June 3 . <unk> continued to become increasingly disorganized as it moved further north , and late that day , the depression transitioned to an extratropical cyclone . The resulting remnants continued to track well east of Japan before dissipating on June 7 . Due to its track away from <unk> , damage remained minimal ; however , as <unk> passed to the south and east of Japan , the storm brought light rainfall to the country , peaking at 81 mm ( 3 @.@ 2 in ) in <unk> , Okinawa . 
 A tropical disturbance persisted in the monsoon trough northwest of <unk> on June 7 , and moved westward without development due to wind shear . On June 11 , the shear decreased enough to allow the convection to organize , and the next day the JMA classified it as a tropical depression northeast of <unk> . On June 13 , the JMA upgraded it to Tropical Storm <unk> to the east of the Philippines , and PAGASA gave it the local name " <unk> " . <unk> moved to the northwest and later to the north , parallel to the eastern Philippines , and on June 17 , the JMA upgraded it to typhoon status . The storm rapidly intensified to the east of Taiwan as it developed a well @-@ defined eye , and while doing so passed over the Japanese island of <unk> @-@ <unk> at around <unk> UTC on June 17 . At 0600 UTC on June 18 , the JTWC estimated peak 1 minute winds of 215 km / h ( 135 mph ) , while the JMA estimated peak 10 minute winds of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) . Increased shear weakened the typhoon to tropical storm strengthen on June 19 , and later that day the JMA declared the storm as extratropical near the <unk> Islands . The extratropical remnants of <unk> continued to the northeast , crossing northern Japan on June 20 and dissipating on June 24 . 
 While offshore the Philippines , <unk> dropped heavy rainfall that caused flooding and left thousands homeless . The storm caused <unk> 131 million ( PHP , $ 2 @.@ 46 million USD ) in damage and 12 deaths . On the Japanese island of <unk> @-@ <unk> , where wind gusts reached 204 km / h ( 127 mph ) . It also affected Taiwan , where floods covered highways and caused mudslides . In Japan , the storm caused widespread power outages , although damage was minimal , and there were 21 injuries . In South Korea , there was $ 12 @.@ 1 million in damage and two deaths . 
 On July 15 , the JMA estimated that a tropical depression formed , and the next day the JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Depression <unk> about <unk> km ( 415 mi ) east of Yap . A subtropical ridge near Okinawa steered the nascent depression to the west @-@ northwest for much of its duration . With warm waters and favorable upper @-@ level conditions , the depression quickly organized , first to Tropical Storm Imbudo on July 17 , and to typhoon status two days later , when PAGASA begin issuing advisories on Typhoon <unk> . Around that time , Imbudo was rapidly intensifying , developing a well @-@ defined eye . At 1200 UTC on July 20 , the JMA estimated peak 10 minute sustained winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) , and the same time , the JTWC estimated 1 minute sustained winds of 240 km / h ( 150 mph ) , making it a super typhoon . Imbudo maintained peak winds for about 12 hours , before undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle . At 0300 UTC on July 22 , Imbudo struck northern Luzon , with 1 minute winds estimated at 205 km / h ( 125 mph ) by the JTWC . It weakened over land , but re @-@ intensified in the South China Sea , striking southern China near Yangjiang , Guangdong on July 24 . Imbudo rapidly weakened , dissipating on July 25 . 
 In the Philippines , officials evacuated over 14 @,@ 000 people . Imbudo was the strongest typhoon to strike since Typhoon <unk> five years prior , The typhoon left widespread areas flooded for several days . Damage was heaviest in the Cagayan Valley , where over 80 @,@ 000 people were displaced by the storm . In Isabela , high winds wrecked most of the banana crop and severely damaged other crops . Throughout the Philippines , Imbudo damaged or destroyed 62 @,@ 314 houses , causing <unk> billion ( 2003 PHP , $ 86 million 2003 USD ) in damage . There were 64 deaths in the country . In southern China in Yangjiang , more than 30 @,@ 000 people evacuated ahead of the storm , and more than half of the trees in the city fell due to strong winds . High winds killed a man in Hong Kong after knocking him off a platform . Throughout Guangdong , Imbudo destroyed 595 @,@ 000 houses and caused eight deaths . Heavy rains spread across southern China , peaking at 343 mm ( 13 @.@ 5 in ) at <unk> County in Guangxi province . There , 12 people died from the storm . Overall damage in China was about ¥ 4 @.@ 45 billion ( CNY , $ <unk> million USD ) . 
 <unk> originated from a tropical depression situated within the monsoon trough to the east of the Philippines on July 15 . Tracking westward , intensification was slow and the system remained a tropical depression as it moved across the central Philippines on July 17 . Upon moving into the South China Sea , conditions allowed for quicker strengthening , and the cyclone reached tropical storm status on July 18 before reaching its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 110 km / h ( 70 mph ) , making it a severe tropical storm . However , atmospheric conditions began to deteriorate as <unk> made landfall on <unk> on July 21 , weakening the system . The tropical storm continued to weaken as it moved over the Gulf of <unk> prior to a final landfall near Hanoi , Vietnam the following day . Tracking inland , the combination of land interaction and wind shear caused <unk> to dissipate over Laos on July 23 . 
 Shortly after development , <unk> tracked through the Philippines , killing two people . After moving into the South China Sea , turbulence produced by the storm resulted in an aviation incident involving a commercial airliner off the western Philippines . Three of the plane 's occupants received minor injuries . In <unk> , <unk> caused heavy rainfall , peaking at 189 mm ( 7 @.@ 44 in ) at a station on <unk> Mountain . The rains resulted in the collapse of 1 @,@ 400 homes and an estimated <unk> ¥ 140 @.@ 27 million ( US $ 16 @.@ 9 million ) in direct economic losses . Effects were worst in Vietnam , where three people were killed . Widespread power outages occurred , and strong winds resulted in agricultural and infrastructural damage , particularly in Vietnam 's northern provinces . 
 <unk> spawned from an area of disturbed weather in the Philippine Sea on July 31 . Tracking northwest , favorable conditions allowed for the intensification of the system to tropical storm strength on August 2 . <unk> reached peak intensity later that day with winds of 85 km / h ( 50 mph ) and a minimum barometric pressure of <unk> mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 29 inHg ) . This intensity was held for several hours until less conducive atmospheric conditions slightly weakened the system ; this was followed by <unk> making landfall on southern Taiwan on August 3 . Subsequently , the storm weakened and moved into the Taiwan Strait before making its final landfall near <unk> , China the next day . The storm quickly weakened over the Chinese mainland , and dissipated entirely several hours after landfall . 
 In Taiwan , where <unk> first made landfall , heavy rainfall resulted in flooding . Commercial flights , schools , and rail service in some areas was cancelled in advance of the storm . Precipitation there peaked at 653 mm ( 25 @.@ 71 in ) over a period of nearly two days in <unk> County . <unk> damage also resulted from the rainfall , and was estimated at over <unk> $ 70 million ( US $ 2 million ) . In China , record rainfall was reported . The worst impacted city was <unk> , where losses due to <unk> reached <unk> ¥ 240 million ( US $ 29 million ) and one death was reported . Power outages were also widespread across southeastern China . Due to <unk> drought conditions , 703 cloud <unk> operations took place in order to artificially generate added rainfall ; such operations resulted in moderate precipitation over the targeted area . Overall , <unk> caused roughly $ 31 million in damage and three deaths . 
 A tropical depression developed on August 2 southeast of Guam , and gradually intensified while moving to the northwest , becoming a tropical storm on August 3 and a typhoon a day later . <unk> formed an eye and became a large storm by the time it approached Okinawa on August 7 . The typhoon attained peak winds of 155 km / h ( 100 mph ) before weakening slightly while turning to the northeast . <unk> made landfall on the Japanese island of <unk> on August 8 , and later moved across portions of <unk> and <unk> . After weakening to tropical storm status , the cyclone became extratropical on August 9 and dissipated three days later . 
 While passing northeast of the Philippines , the typhoon caused light damage in the archipelago . The eye crossed over Okinawa , where <unk> left 166 @,@ 800 people without power and caused 10 injuries . Near where <unk> first struck Japan , <unk> reported a peak wind gust of 166 km / h ( 103 mph ) , at the time the third strongest on record there . The typhoon also dropped torrential rainfall peaking at <unk> mm ( 26 @.@ 9 in ) . The combination of winds and rainfall caused landslides , particularly on <unk> . Nationwide , <unk> killed 20 people , destroyed 708 houses , and caused ¥ 35 @.@ 1 billion ( <unk> , $ <unk> @.@ 8 million USD ) in damage . 
 <unk> first struck the Philippines , resulting in heavy rainfall and <unk> approximately 1 @,@ 000 families . The flooding caused severe damage and killed one person . <unk> 's effects were much more severe in China . In Hong Kong , eleven people were injured and isolated flooding occurred as a result of the typhoon 's outer rainbands . However , Guangdong Province , <unk> Province , and Guangxi were the Chinese regions most extensively impacted . The typhoon brought record wind gusts into Guangxi . In those three regions combined , 13 @,@ 000 homes were estimated to have collapsed and a large <unk> of farmland was damaged . Two people were killed in China and economic losses <unk> to ¥ 2 @.@ 1 billion ( US $ 253 million ) . Due to its positioning and track , of all areas in Vietnam only the country 's more northern regions were impacted by <unk> . Flash flooding occurred in earnest in those regions , and 1 @,@ 000 homes were flattened . One person was killed and five others were injured in Vietnam . Overall , the typhoon was responsible for the deaths of four persons . 
 The monsoon trough spawned several tropical disturbances in the middle of August , one of which became Tropical Depression <unk> near the Philippines . On August 18 , an area of convection persisted on the southern side of a circulation , developing into a tropical depression east of Luzon . It moved quickly northward and later to the northwest in an area generally unfavorable for strengthening , such as the presence of wind shear and land interaction . On August 19 , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm <unk> to the east of Taiwan . Later that day , the circulation passed just 55 km ( 35 mi ) north of <unk> , although the convection was exposed that time . On August 20 , the JMA assessed <unk> as dissipating in the Taiwan Strait , although the JTWC continued advisories until the storm moved ashore in southeastern China . 
 Rainfall in Taiwan reached 69 mm ( 2 @.@ 7 in ) in Ilan County . On the island , the storm left several hundred houses without power due to a lightning strike . On mainland China , rainfall peaked at 101 mm ( 4 @.@ 0 in ) in <unk> , Zhejiang , which were largely beneficial in <unk> drought conditions , while winds gusted to 100 km / h ( 62 mph ) . The storm damaged or destroyed 5 @,@ 880 houses and flooded 1 @,@ <unk> ha ( 3 @,@ 180 acres ) of <unk> fields , causing ¥ 38 @.@ 6 million ( CNY , $ 4 @.@ 7 million USD ) in damage . 
 On August 27 , a tropical depression developed about 520 km ( 325 mi ) northwest of Guam , which initially drifted to the southwest before turning to the northwest . On August 29 , the JMA upgraded it to Tropical Storm <unk> , and that day PAGASA began issuing advisories on Tropical Storm <unk> . The storm quickly intensified into a typhoon , after developing an eye in the center . On September 1 , the JMA estimated <unk> attained peak 10 minute winds of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) , and the JTWC assessed peak 1 – minute winds of 230 km / h ( 145 mph ) . While near peak intensity , the center of <unk> passed about 45 km ( 30 mi ) south of the southern tip of Taiwan . The typhoon weakened steadily and was a severe tropical storm by the time it made landfall on September 2 just east of Hong Kong . The JTWC estimated landfall winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) , making it the strongest typhoon to strike the Pearl River Delta since Typhoon Hope in 1979 . <unk> rapidly weakened while continuing westward through China , dissipating on September 3 over Guangxi . 
 In the Philippines , <unk> interacted with the monsoon to produce heavy rainfall , killing one person . While in the vicinity , <unk> produced gusts of 100 km / h ( 62 mph ) on <unk> , a Japanese <unk> of Okinawa . Heavy rainfall in Taiwan reached 628 mm ( 24 @.@ 7 in ) in <unk> County , and winds peaked at 176 km / h ( 109 mph ) on Orchid Island before the <unk> was destroyed . The caused about <unk> $ 200 ( <unk> , $ 115 million USD ) in crop damage , and killed three people . Damage was minor in Hong Kong , and four fishermen were missing and presumed drowned after their boat sank . On the Chinese mainland , strong winds left 90 % of the city of <unk> without power , and killed 16 construction workers due to a half @-@ finished building collapsing . Across Guangdong , the typhoon damaged crops and destroyed 54 @,@ 000 homes were destroyed . Overall damage in China was estimated at ¥ 2 @.@ 3 billion ( CNY , $ 277 million USD ) , and across Guangdong , the typhoon killed 40 people . 
 The typhoon first affected the <unk> Islands of Japan . On <unk> @-@ <unk> , strong winds damaged 104 buildings , and 95 % of residents lost power . <unk> dropped heavy rainfall there , including rates of 58 @.@ 5 mm ( 2 @.@ 30 in ) in an hour , and 402 @.@ 5 mm ( 15 @.@ 85 in ) in 24 hours , the latter setting a record . One person died on <unk> @-@ <unk> after being struck by flying glass . Elsewhere in Japan , the storm caused flights to be canceled , while rainfall @-@ induced landslides blocked roads . There were two other deaths in Japan , and damage totaled ¥ 11 @.@ 3 billion ( <unk> , $ 96 million USD ) . Damage was heaviest in South Korea , notably where it moved ashore . Winds in <unk> near the landfall location reached 154 km / h ( 96 mph ) , the second @-@ highest on record . There , the port sustained heavy damage , causing disruptions to exports in the months following the storm . Nationwide , the high winds destroyed about 5 @,@ 000 houses and damaged 13 @,@ 000 homes and businesses , leaving 25 @,@ 000 people homeless . About 1 @.@ 47 million lost power , and widespread crop damage occurred , resulting in the worst rice crop in 23 years . Across South Korea , <unk> killed 117 people , and overall damage totaled <unk> 5 @.@ 52 trillion won ( $ 4 @.@ 8 billion USD ) . 
 Towards the end of September , the monsoon trough spawned a tropical disturbance east @-@ northeast of Yap , which became a tropical depression on September 24 . There were initially several <unk> , with a tropical upper tropospheric trough to the northeast increasing outflow . After slowing and turning to the northeast , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm <unk> on September 26 . After the storm developed a large eye feature , the JTWC upgraded it to typhoon status on September 27 , although the JMA did not follow suit until the following day while near <unk> @-@ <unk> . Also that day , <unk> passed 95 km ( 60 mi ) west of Iwo Jima , and the JMA estimated peak 10 minute winds of 130 km / h ( 80 mph ) . The JTWC estimated peak 1 minute winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) , before an approaching trough caused the typhoon to accelerate northeastward . The convection diminished near the center , causing <unk> to become extratropical on September 30 . The remnants continued generally northeastward through the <unk> Islands , eventually passing south of mainland Alaska on October 7 . 
 On <unk> @-@ <unk> , Typhoon <unk> produced sustained winds of 102 km / h ( 63 mph ) , with gusts to 200 km / h ( 124 mph ) , which was the third strongest on record for the station . Rainfall there reached 183 mm ( 7 @.@ 2 in ) . Wind gusts on Iwo Jima peaked at 109 km / h ( 68 mph ) . 
 In the middle of October , an area of convection persisted along the monsoon trough between Luzon and Guam , developing into a tropical depression on October 17 . The same monsoon trough later spawned Typhoon <unk> to the east . For several days , the system remained disorganized while drifting to the west @-@ northwest due to weak steering currents south of the subtropical ridge . On October 19 , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm <unk> , and by that time the storm had begun drifting to the northeast . With favorable outflow , <unk> quickly intensified into a typhoon on October 20 after developing an eye , and two days later , the JMA estimated peak winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) . The JTWC estimated peak 1 minute winds of 230 km / h ( 145 mph ) around the time the well @-@ defined eye had expanded to 37 km ( 23 mi ) . Subsequently , the typhoon accelerated northeastward into the westerlies and began weakening due to increasing wind shear and dry air . On October 26 , <unk> became extratropical to the east of Japan and dissipated the next day . The passage of the typhoon caused surface <unk> a concentration in the ocean to increase 30 @-@ fold . 
 The same monsoon trough that spawned Typhoon <unk> also produced an area of convection to the north @-@ northeast of Guam , becoming a tropical depression on October 19 . The system moved northwestward and later turned to the northeast around the subtropical ridge . With low wind shear and favorable outflow , the convection became better organized , and the JMA upgraded it to Tropical Storm <unk> on October 21 . After an eye began to form , <unk> was upgraded to typhoon status the next day . An approaching trough caused <unk> to accelerate northeastward while also increasing outflow . On October 24 , the JMA estimated peak winds of 175 km / h ( 110 mph ) while the JTWC estimated winds of 240 km / h ( 150 mph ) , an unusually high intensity for 30 ° N. Subsequently , <unk> rounded the subtropical ridge and began moving to the east @-@ southeast , beginning a nearly week @-@ long loop . The cold front had passed to the north and failed to bring the typhoon northeastward . 
 Increasing wind shear weakened the convection , and <unk> deteriorated into a severe tropical storm on October 26 . The next day , it began moving westward while passing about 345 km ( 215 mi ) north of Wake Island . A large eye of 110 km ( 70 mi ) in diameter developed , and on October 28 , the JMA re @-@ upgraded <unk> to typhoon status . The next day , the typhoon turned to the northeast due to another approaching trough . With decreasing wind shear and warmer waters , <unk> re @-@ intensified significantly on October 29 , reaching a secondary peak of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) according to JMA , and 215 km / h ( 135 mph ) according to JTWC . The storm moved very closely along the track it took several days prior . Increasing wind shear on October 30 caused rapid weakening , resulting in the eye dissipating . By the next day , the center was exposed , and <unk> became extratropical , later exiting the basin on November 1 . The remnants weakened , later turning to the southeast and dissipating on November 11 southwest of California . 
 Late in October , an area of convection persisted northwest of <unk> and quickly organized into a tropical depression on October 29 . Moving west @-@ northwestward toward the Philippines due to a ridge to the east , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm <unk> on October 30 . With minimal wind shear , the storm strengthened further and developed a large eye . The JTWC upgraded <unk> to typhoon status on October 31 , estimating peak 1 minute winds of 140 km / h ( 85 mph ) , although the JMA estimated the storm only attained peak 10 minute winds of 95 km / h ( 60 mph ) . Early on November 1 , <unk> made landfall on northeastern Luzon in the Philippines , south of <unk> . The storm weakened over land and emerged into the South China Sea . By that time , it was moving northward along the periphery of the ridge to the east . On November 2 , <unk> turned to the northeast , passing just east of Taiwan . The next day , it weakened to tropical depression status , and after <unk> offshore eastern Taiwan , <unk> continued northeastward . It became extratropical on November 5 and dissipated the next day near southern Japan . 
 In the Philippines , <unk> dropped about 150 mm ( 6 in ) of rainfall , which flooded the Cagayan River and killed four people . In Taiwan , rainfall reached <unk> mm ( 21 @.@ 8 in ) in <unk> County . On the Japanese island of <unk> , rainfall totaled 197 mm ( 7 @.@ 8 in ) , which broke the <unk> and daily record for the station in November . 
 A tropical depression developed near Yap on November 11 . The system intensified gradually as it tracked quickly westward toward the Philippines . An anticyclone <unk> allowed for strengthening , and the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm <unk> on November 12 . Simultaneously , the cyclone entered the area of responsibility of the Philippine <unk> , <unk> and Astronomical Services Administration , which named it Tropical Storm <unk> . At around 1600 UTC on November 13 , <unk> made landfall on northern <unk> Island in the Philippines before traversing the remainder of the archipelago from east to west . The cyclone emerged into the South China Sea weakened but quickly re @-@ intensified while continuing to the west @-@ northwest . The JTWC estimated peak winds of 140 km / h ( 85 mph ) on November 16 , and later that day , the JMA upgraded the storm to typhoon status , estimating peak 10 @-@ minute winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) . On November 18 , <unk> passed near southwestern <unk> and weakened , with the convection diminishing from the circulation . By the next day , the system weakened to tropical depression status , and dissipated shortly after moving ashore over <unk> , China . 
 In the Philippines , <unk> produced strong winds , heavy rainfall , and rough seas . The storm caused widespread power outages and ferry disruptions . According to the PAGASA in its post @-@ storm report , a total of 13 people lost their lives during the storm . On <unk> , the storm helped end one of the worst summer droughts in almost 65 years , although it also left heavy crop damage , <unk> 64 @,@ 000 ha ( 160 @,@ 000 acres ) of fields and killing 400 head of livestock . With about 800 homes destroyed , damage on <unk> amounted to $ 197 million ( 2003 USD ) . Effects were minor in mainland China . 
 Typhoon <unk> formed on November 18 from the monsoon trough to the west of the Marshall Islands . Early in its duration , it moved generally to the west or west @-@ southwest . On November 21 , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm <unk> , and two days later , it strengthened into a typhoon , developing an eye . <unk> later began a prolonged movement to the northwest , during which it passed near several islands in Yap State . The typhoon reached peak intensity on November 26 , with peak 10 – minute sustained winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) . It later weakened due to a variety of unfavorable conditions , and after <unk> to the northeast , <unk> became extratropical south of Japan on December 2 . 
 An area of convection formed on May 16 to the southwest of <unk> , located within an area of weak wind shear . The next day , the JMA and the JTWC both classified the system as a tropical depression . The convection was disorganized in association with multiple circulation centers , although it gradually organized . Moving westward initially , the depression turned more to the north into an area of increasing wind shear . On May 19 , the JTWC upgraded the system to Tropical Storm <unk> , and on the same day , PAGASA classified it as Tropical Depression <unk> . Soon after , the convection decreased from the center , and by May 20 , all warning agencies had discontinued advisories . 
 On July 9 , PAGASA classified a system as Tropical Depression Falcon , off the west coast of the Philippines . The JMA also briefly initiated advisories before dropping them later on July 9 . Later in the month , PAGASA briefly issued advisories on Tropical Depression <unk> on July 30 off the east coast of <unk> . The depression dissipated the next day , causing about <unk> million ( PHP , $ 145 @,@ 000 USD ) in damage . The monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression north of Luzon on August 18 , with PAGASA naming it <unk> . There were several <unk> in the region , with Tropical Storm <unk> to the northeast near Taiwan , and the overall system moved generally westward . PAGASA briefly classified <unk> as a tropical storm on August 19 before ending advisories the next day . The system spread rainfall across China , reaching 82 @.@ 4 mm ( 3 @.@ 24 in ) in <unk> , <unk> . 
 On September 5 , former Hurricane <unk> crossed the International Date Line into the basin . By that time , the circulation was largely exposed from the convection , and the center quickly dissipated . Later in the month , the monsoon trough spawned a disturbance east of the Philippines that PAGASA classified as Tropical Depression <unk> on September 15 . The system moved westward but never intensified , dissipating west of Luzon on September 19 . The broad system also spawned Typhoon <unk> @-@ <unk> . 
 In mid @-@ November , the JMA briefly tracked a weak tropical depression near Wake Island . The agency also briefly tracked a tropical depression off the coast of Vietnam on December 16 . It finally dissipated on December 17 , with the pressure and winds unknown . The final system of the year was a tropical depression that originated out of the monsoon trough on December 24 east of the Philippines . After initially moving to the west , it turned to the south , and the JTWC estimated the depression intensified into a tropical storm . During this time , PAGASA classified it as Tropical Storm <unk> . The system made landfall in northeastern <unk> and dissipated on December 27 , bringing heavy rainfall . 
 Within the North @-@ western Pacific Ocean , both the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) and the Philippine <unk> , <unk> and Astronomical Services Administration assign names to tropical cyclones that develop in the Western Pacific , which can result in a tropical cyclone having two names . The Japan Meteorological Agency 's <unk> Tokyo — Typhoon Center assigns international names to tropical cyclones on behalf of the World Meteorological Organization 's Typhoon Committee , should they be judged to have 10 @-@ minute sustained <unk> of 65 km / h , ( 40 mph ) . While the Philippine <unk> , <unk> and Astronomical Services Administration assigns names to tropical cyclones which move into or form as a tropical depression in their area of responsibility located between 135 ° E and 115 ° E and between 5 ° N @-@ 25 ° N even if the cyclone has had an international name assigned to it . The names of significant tropical cyclones are retired , by both PAGASA and the Typhoon Committee . Should the list of names for the Philippine region be exhausted then names will be taken from an auxiliary list of which the first ten are published each season . <unk> names are marked in gray . 
 During the season 21 named tropical cyclones developed in the Western Pacific and were named by the Japan Meteorological Agency , when it was determined that they had become tropical storms . These names were contributed to a list of a 140 names submitted by the fourteen members nations and territories of the <unk> / <unk> Typhoon Committee . 
 The Philippine <unk> , <unk> and Astronomical Services Administration uses its own naming scheme for tropical cyclones in their area of responsibility . PAGASA assigns names to tropical depressions that form within their area of responsibility and any tropical cyclone that might move into their area of responsibility . Should the list of names for a given year prove to be insufficient , names are taken from an auxiliary list , the first 10 of which are published each year before the season starts . The names not retired from this list will be used again in the 2007 season . Names that were not assigned are marked in gray . 
 The following table provides basic meteorological and impact information for each tropical cyclone from the 2003 Pacific typhoon season in <unk> format ; unnamed tropical cyclones are not included . PAGASA names for storms are provided in parentheses . Storms entering from the Central Pacific only include their information while in the western Pacific , and are noted with an <unk> * . 
 The <unk> process for the industrial production of <unk> through the oxidation of ammonia with hydrogen <unk> in the presence of <unk> was developed in the early 1970s . 
 <unk> <unk> proved useful in the syntheses of complex natural product , such as <unk> which is marketed as a chemotherapy agent . Both the <unk> <unk> total synthesis and the <unk> <unk> total synthesis feature asymmetric α @-@ <unk> with <unk> . 
 The two main approaches to synthesis of N @-@ H , N @-@ <unk> , and N @-@ <unk> are oxidation of <unk> with <unk> ( A ) and <unk> of <unk> ( B ) . 
 In the late 1970s and early 1980s Franklin A. Davis synthesized the first N @-@ <unk> , which act exclusively as oxygen transfer reagents , and are the most predominantly used class of <unk> today . While originally synthesized with <unk> and the phase transfer catalyst <unk> chloride , an improved synthesis using <unk> as the <unk> is now most prevalent . 
 Many N @-@ <unk> are used today , each with slightly different properties and reactivity . These reagents are summarized in the table below . 
 <unk> are <unk> in the <unk> process for the production of <unk> . Many millions of kilograms of <unk> are produced annually by this method that involves a step wherein ammonia is <unk> in the presence of methyl <unk> <unk> to give the <unk> : 
 In subsequent steps the <unk> is converted to the <unk> , which is the immediate en route to <unk> : 
 Extensive work has been reported on asymmetric <unk> of <unk> <unk> with <unk> derivatives , achieving moderate to high enantiomeric excess . The commonly accepted proposed transition state that <unk> this <unk> outcome involves an open transition state where the <unk> bulk of R1 determines the face of approach . 
 The selectivity of some <unk> may be drastically improved in some cases with the addition of coordinating groups alpha to the <unk> ring as <unk> <unk> and <unk> in the table above . In these instances it is proposed that the reaction proceeds through a closed transition state where the metal <unk> is stabilized by <unk> from the sulfate and coordinating groups on the camphor skeleton . 
 <unk> with <unk> or <unk> <unk> are capable of nitrogen atom transfer , although this reactivity has received considerably less attention . 
 <unk> takes advantage of this <unk> as the key step in his synthesis of ( + ) <unk> , a natural medicine classified by the <unk> as possibly effective in the treatment of <unk> <unk> and the sexual problems caused by selective <unk> <unk> inhibitors . 
 It is also notable that <unk> will <unk> <unk> to <unk> . <unk> @-@ trans selectivity of the resulting <unk> is poor , however , yields are good to excellent . It is thought that some <unk> <unk> over time through a <unk> intermediate . 
 <unk> undergo <unk> reactions with <unk> to afford a number of unique five membered <unk> , as depicted in the figure below . This reactivity is due to the strained three membered ring and weak N @-@ O bond . 
 The battle was fought three weeks after the Austrian capitulation at Ulm and three weeks before the Russo @-@ Austrian defeat at the Battle of <unk> . After <unk> Austria withdrew from the war . The French demanded a high indemnity and Francis II abdicated as Holy Roman Emperor , releasing the German states from their allegiance to the Holy Roman Empire . 
 In a series of conflicts from 1803 @-@ 15 known as the Napoleonic Wars , various European powers formed five coalitions against the First French Empire . Like the wars sparked by the French Revolution ( 1789 ) , these further revolutionized the formation , organization and training of European armies and led to an unprecedented <unk> , mainly due to mass conscription . Under the leadership of Napoleon , French power rose quickly as the Grande <unk> conquered most of Europe , and collapsed rapidly after the disastrous invasion of Russia in 1812 . Napoleon 's empire ultimately suffered complete military defeat in the 1813 – 14 campaigns , resulting in the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in France . Although Napoleon made a spectacular return in 1815 , known as the Hundred Days , his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo , the pursuit of his army and himself , his abdication and banishment to the Island of Saint Helena concluded the Napoleonic Wars . 
 From 1803 @-@ 06 the Third Coalition fought the First French Empire and its client states ( see table at right ) . Although several naval battles determined control of the seas , the outcome of the war was decided on the continent , predominantly in two major land operations in the <unk> valley : the Ulm campaign in the upper <unk> and the Vienna campaign , in the middle <unk> valley . 
 The inexperienced Ferdinand was a poor choice of replacement for the capable Charles , having neither maturity nor aptitude for the assignment . Although Ferdinand retained nominal command , day @-@ to @-@ day decisions were placed in the hands of Mack , equally ill @-@ suited for such an important assignment . When Mack was wounded early in the campaign , he was unable to take full charge of the army . Consequently , command further devolved to Lieutenant Field Marshal Karl Philipp , Prince of <unk> , an able cavalry officer but inexperienced in the command of such a large army . 
 The campaign was not entirely bad news for Vienna . At <unk> , Johann von <unk> arranged his 25 @,@ 000 infantry and cavalry in a prime defensive position and , on 11 October , the overly confident General of Division Pierre <unk> de l <unk> attacked <unk> 's force with fewer than 8 @,@ 000 men . The French lost 1 @,@ 500 men killed and wounded . Aside from taking the Imperial Eagles and <unk> of the 15th and 17th <unk> , <unk> 's force also captured 900 men , 11 guns and 18 ammunition wagons . 
 Napoleon 's lightning campaign exposed the Austrian <unk> command structure and poor supply apparatus . Mack completely <unk> the French <unk> and scattered his forces ; as the French defeated each unit separately , the surviving Austrians withdrew toward the Ulm fortifications . Napoleon arrived to take personal command of close to 80 @,@ 000 men . At Ulm on 16 October Karl Mack surrendered his <unk> army of 20 @,@ 000 infantry and 3 @,@ 273 cavalry . The officers were released on the condition that they not serve against France until formally exchanged for French officers captured by the Austrians , an agreement to which they held . 
 The few Austrian corps not trapped at Ulm withdrew toward Vienna , with the French in close pursuit . A Russian army under Gen. Mikhail <unk> also <unk> away from the French , withdrawing to the east . At the <unk> river on 22 October it joined with the retreating Austrian corps commanded by Michael von <unk> . On 5 November the Coalition forces held a successful rearguard action in <unk> . On 7 November the Russians arrived in St. <unk> and crossed the <unk> river the next day . Late on 9 November they destroyed the bridges across the <unk> , holding the last one at the hamlet of Stein , near the village <unk> , until the late afternoon . 
 Napoleon had calculated that <unk> would withdraw toward Vienna , expecting reinforcements from Russia ; he envisioned that the armies would engage in a great battle at Vienna , and that this battle would decide the war . Consequently , Napoleon drew divisions from four of the other seven corps of the Grande <unk> to create a new VIII Corps . This corps was to secure the north shore of the <unk> , block any of the Austrian or Russian groups from reinforcing one another and , more importantly , prevent <unk> from crossing the river and escaping to Russia . 
 On 9 November <unk> 's division reached <unk> an der <unk> and covered the 50 kilometers ( 31 mi ) to <unk> by early on the following afternoon . Here it <unk> with some Russian patrols to the east of the town and expelled them . Feeling confident , the French established a forward post just upstream from Stein . In <unk> itself <unk> set up his command post and directed the establishment of a small field hospital . Although the position seemed secure , he had ignored Napoleon 's strict instructions and neglected to protect his left ( north ) flank . 
 Both sides claimed victory . Although losses were fairly equal in terms of <unk> wounded or dead on each <unk> Coalition forces went into battle with 24 @,@ 000 men while the French started with <unk> 's division of about 6 @,@ 000 , which grew close to 8 @,@ 000 when <unk> 's men joined the fighting in the afternoon . Regardless , <unk> 's division was nearly destroyed ; the 30 percent losses experienced by the French fell predominantly on his division . <unk> for both sides , the fighting was hard . The weather had been cold ; an early storm had left slick icy mud in the roadways , and <unk> " like chandeliers " hung from the trees . 
 For the Coalition , the Russians were secure on the north bank of the <unk> , awaiting reinforcements from <unk> ; the bridges between <unk> and Vienna had been destroyed , making French access to the Austrian capital more difficult , but not impossible . After six months of fighting in which the Austrians had enjoyed little good news , the Coalition could claim a difficult and timely victory . The French had retreated from the field with a badly <unk> division and <unk> had secured the right flank . Indeed , Francis was so pleased with the outcome at <unk> that he awarded <unk> the Military Order of Maria <unk> . 
 After the victory at <unk> , Napoleon dispersed the VIII Corps and reassigned <unk> . However disappointed he may have been with <unk> , Napoleon was pleased with <unk> 's performance . As recognition of his conduct in what the French called " the immortal Battle of <unk> " , <unk> received the Officer 's Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor . 
 The second determining event , the decisive French victory at the Battle of <unk> over the combined Russian and Austrian armies , forced the Austrian withdrawal from the Coalition . The subsequent Peace of <unk> , signed on 26 December 1805 , reinforced the earlier treaties of <unk> <unk> and <unk> . Furthermore , Austria ceded land to Napoleon 's German allies , and paid an indemnity of 40 million francs . Victory at <unk> also gave Napoleon the latitude to create a <unk> zone of German states between France and the states of Prussia , Russia , and Austria . These measures did not establish a lasting peace on the continent . Prussian worries about growing French influence in Central Europe sparked the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806 , in which Austria did not participate . 
 Until 1805 , <unk> was probably best known as the village in which crusader Richard the <unk> was held by Leopold V , Duke of Austria . In 1741 , during the War of the Austrian <unk> , several hundred local villagers had held off the French and Bavarian armies , intent on capturing Vienna , by painting drain pipes to look like cannons , and beating on drums , thus suggesting the presence of a large force . 
 After 1805 , the exploits of 40 @,@ 000 French , Russian , and Austrian soldiers excited the European imagination . General <unk> 's grave has never been found , but in 1811 a monument for him was erected at the Stein Tor , the gate leading from the old village of <unk> to the hamlet of Stein . The house in which Captain von <unk> lived was marked with a bronze plate commemorating his contribution to the battle . In 1840 , a Spanish <unk> created an image of the battle , which was later expanded by English <unk> John <unk> . The image depicts the evacuation of French troops via the <unk> flotilla ( see <unk> image ) on a <unk> night . In fact , the moon was in its last quarter phase 48 hours later , and on 11 November probably did not provide as much light as depicted in the image . 
 In 1836 , Jean Antoine <unk> Fort ( French , 1793 – 1861 ) , a historical painter , created a <unk> of the battle , Combat de <unk> le 11 <unk> 1805 ( ( English ) Battle of <unk> of 11 November 1805 ) , which is in the <unk> collection at Versailles . 
 In the Russian novel War and Peace , Leo <unk> devoted several pages to the battle , its prelude , and its aftermath , and the delivery of its news to the Tsar by Prince Andrew . Between <unk> and <unk> , at the edge of the <unk> plain , stands the " Little Frenchman " memorial ( see image ) erected in 1905 to commemorate the battle ; it bears the names of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and others on a copper @-@ engraved plate .

 <unk> Edward <unk> / <unk> / ( born July 12 , 1977 ) is an American Canadian professional wrestler , mixed martial artist , and former amateur wrestler and professional American football player . He is currently signed to WWE on the Raw brand . He is a four @-@ time WWE ( World Heavyweight ) Champion , a former <unk> Heavyweight Champion , and an NCAA Division I Heavyweight Wrestling Champion . He is also a one @-@ time <unk> Heavyweight Champion , making him a five @-@ time world champion in professional wrestling . As of July 14 , 2016 , he is # 8 in official <unk> heavyweight rankings . 
 In April 2012 , <unk> once again returned to professional wrestling , rejoining WWE after an eight @-@ year hiatus . Two years later , at WrestleMania XXX , <unk> defeated The Undertaker to end his undefeated streak at the premier annual event . <unk> has been managed by Paul <unk> throughout the majority of his professional wrestling career . He has <unk> numerous pay @-@ per @-@ view events for both the WWE and <unk> , including WrestleMania <unk> , WrestleMania 31 , <unk> 100 , and <unk> 116 . In 2015 , an ESPN.com article referred to <unk> as " the most accomplished athlete in pro wrestling history " . 
 <unk> was born in Webster , South Dakota , on July 12 , 1977 . He was raised on a Webster dairy farm owned by his parents , Stephanie and Richard <unk> . He is of German descent . He has two older brothers named Troy and Chad , and a younger sister named <unk> . At age 17 , he joined the National Guard , where he was assigned to an office job after his red @-@ green <unk> was deemed hazardous to his desire to work with explosives . He lost this job after failing a computer typing test , and later worked for a construction company . 
 <unk> attended Webster High School , where he played football and competed in amateur wrestling , placing third in the state championships his senior year . He then attended Bismarck State College , where he won the National Junior College Athletic Association ( <unk> ) heavyweight wrestling championship in his sophomore year . He transferred to the University of Minnesota on a wrestling scholarship for his junior and senior college years . There , he was roommates with future WWE colleague Shelton Benjamin , who was also his assistant coach . 
 <unk> won the 2000 National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) Division I heavyweight wrestling championship his senior year after being the runner @-@ up to Stephen Neal the year prior . He finished his amateur career as a two @-@ time <unk> All @-@ American , the 1998 <unk> Heavyweight Champion , two @-@ time NCAA All @-@ American , two @-@ time Big Ten Conference Champion , and the 2000 NCAA Heavyweight Champion , with a record of 106 – 5 overall in four years of college . 
 In 2000 , <unk> signed with the World Wrestling Federation ( WWF ) . He was sent to its developmental territory , Ohio Valley Wrestling . There , <unk> first met future friend and manager Paul <unk> . He formed a tag team known as " The Minnesota <unk> Crew " with his former college roommate , Shelton Benjamin . <unk> and Benjamin won the <unk> Southern Tag Team Championship on three separate occasions . <unk> wrestled several dark matches in 2001 and 2002 before being called up to the main roster . 
 With Angle temporarily put out of action , <unk> 's rivalry with <unk> and the Big Show resumed , which culminated in a match at the Royal Rumble in January 2003 with the winner being placed into the Royal Rumble later in the evening . <unk> would defeat Big Show and entered the Royal Rumble as the # 29 entry , the second to last competitor to enter the match . He eliminated Matt Hardy and The World 's Greatest Tag Team , which was composed of Charlie Haas and his former <unk> teammate , Shelton Benjamin , who were <unk> by Angle . <unk> would then eliminate The Undertaker last and win the Royal Rumble , which guaranteed him a title match at WrestleMania <unk> . 
 After the Royal Rumble , <unk> and Chris <unk> faced off against Angle , Haas , and Benjamin at No Way Out the following month and <unk> 's team won the match . During the match at WrestleMania , <unk> <unk> a shooting star press , a move he 'd done numerous times in developmental matches , and jammed his head and neck . This stunned <unk> and forced Angle and <unk> to improvise the finish of the match . <unk> would defeat Angle , after delivering an F @-@ 5 , to win his second WWE Championship . <unk> was diagnosed with a legitimate concussion from the <unk> shooting star press . 
 As <unk> and Big Show continued their rivalry , Kurt Angle returned from his neck surgery and he and <unk> began to form a more friendly rivalry , as the two were allies yet contenders for the title . At the first ever SmackDown brand @-@ exclusive pay @-@ per @-@ view in July , <unk> , <unk> took on Angle and Big Show in a No <unk> triple threat match for his title , which ended after Angle hit the Angle Slam on both Big Show and <unk> , <unk> the champion to become WWE Champion for a fourth time . 
 <unk> successfully defended his newly won title against the debuting Paul London on October 9 edition of SmackDown ! . He returned to feuding with The Undertaker . <unk> had previously cost Undertaker the title in a match against then @-@ champion Kurt Angle , which granted him a shot at <unk> 's title . At No Mercy , <unk> defeated Undertaker in a <unk> Chain match . The rivalry then came to an end after The Undertaker chose to focus on Mr. McMahon . 
 The Survivor Series event marked the first time <unk> met Goldberg from the Raw brand . After <unk> claimed in a backstage interview that he could beat anybody in the world , Goldberg interrupted the interview and introduced himself to <unk> , shaking hands with him before leaving with a <unk> . <unk> followed this rivalry with a feud involving Hardcore Holly . In the storyline , Holly wanted revenge on <unk> for legitimately injuring his neck during a previous match between the two in 2002 which left Holly in need of neck surgery and out of action for a year . At the Royal Rumble in 2004 , <unk> defeated Holly to retain the WWE Championship . Later in the Royal Rumble match , <unk> attacked Goldberg and delivered an F @-@ 5 , enabling Kurt Angle to eliminate him . 
 On July 15 , 2006 , New Japan Pro Wrestling announced <unk> would not return to defend the <unk> Heavyweight Championship due to " <unk> issues " and had been stripped of the title . A tournament was held on July 16 to determine the new champion which was won by Hiroshi <unk> . <unk> continued to possess the physical <unk> Championship belt until late June 2007 . 
 <unk> had previously signed a non @-@ compete clause in order to be released from his contract with WWE , which prohibited him from working for any other professional wrestling companies before June 2010 . However , he decided to challenge this ruling in court . WWE responded with a <unk> after <unk> breached the agreement by appearing at a New Japan Pro Wrestling show in 2004 . In July 2005 , the two sides dropped their claims and entered negotiations to renew their relationship . WWE had offered <unk> a contract , but on August 2 , 2005 , WWE 's official website reported that <unk> had withdrawn from any involvement with the company . The lawsuit began to enter settlement talks on September 21 , but did not get solved . 
 On January 14 , 2006 , Judge Christopher <unk> stated that unless WWE gave him a good argument between then and the 25th , he would rule in favor of <unk> , giving him a summary judgment . This would have enabled <unk> to work anywhere , immediately . WWE was later granted a deadline <unk> . On April 24 , WWE announced on <unk> that both parties had reached a settlement . On June 12 , a federal judge dismissed the case at the request of both legal parties . 
 After his match at WrestleMania <unk> , <unk> sidelined his career in WWE to pursue a career in the National Football League ( NFL ) despite not playing American football since high school . The WWE issued this statement on their official website , <unk> , following his departure : 
 <unk> <unk> has made a personal decision to put his WWE career on hold to prepare to <unk> for the National Football League this season . <unk> has wrestled his entire professional career in the WWE and we are proud of his accomplishments and wish him the best in his new endeavor . 
 <unk> later told a Minnesota radio show that he had " three wonderful years " in WWE , but had grown unhappy and always wanted to play pro football , adding that he did not want to be 40 years old and wondering if he could have " made it " in football . In an interview about the NFL , he stated : 
 This is no load of bull ; it 's no WWE stunt . I am dead serious about this . I ain 't afraid of anything and I ain 't afraid of anybody . I 've been an underdog in athletics since I was five . I got zero college offers for wrestling . Now people say I can 't play football , that it 's a joke . I say I can . I 'm as good an athlete as a lot of guys in the NFL , if not better . I 've always had to fight for everything . I wasn 't the best <unk> in amateur wrestling but I was strong , had great conditioning , and a hard head . Nobody could break me . As long as I have that , I don 't give a damn what anybody else thinks . 
 <unk> had a great showing at the NFL <unk> . On April 17 , 2004 , a <unk> collided with his <unk> ; he suffered a broken jaw and left hand , a <unk> <unk> , and a pulled groin . Several NFL teams expressed interest in watching <unk> work out . The Minnesota Vikings worked out <unk> on June 11 , 2004 but he was hampered by the groin injury suffered in the April motorcycle accident . On July 24 it was reported that he was nearly recovered from his groin injury . He signed with the Vikings on July 27 and played in several preseason games for the team . He was released by the Vikings on August 30 , 2004 . <unk> received an invitation to play as a representative for the Vikings in NFL Europa but declined due to his desire to stay in the United States with his family . He had several football cards produced of him during his time with the Vikings . 
 On April 29 , 2006 , after the final match of the K @-@ 1 World Grand Prix 2006 in Las Vegas , <unk> announced his intent to join K @-@ 1 's mixed martial arts league , Hero 's . He trained with Minnesota Martial Arts Academy under Greg Nelson and Minnesota Assistant Head wrestling coach Marty Morgan . <unk> announced on August 12 in Las Vegas that he had signed a deal with the K @-@ 1 promotion . His first fight was scheduled against <unk> Hong @-@ man of Korea on June 2 , 2007 , at the K @-@ 1 <unk> ! ! USA show . However , prior to the match , Hong @-@ Man was replaced by <unk> <unk> Kim . <unk> submitted <unk> Kim with strikes in 1 : 09 of the first round to win his first official <unk> match . 
 <unk> would then face Randy <unk> for the <unk> Heavyweight Championship at <unk> 91 on November 15 . <unk> would beat <unk> via a technical knockout ( TKO ) in the second round to become the new <unk> Heavyweight Champion . 
 <unk> 's next defense was against undefeated top contender Cain <unk> on October 23 , at the Honda Center in <unk> , California at <unk> 121 . Dana White announced via <unk> that the <unk> would bring back <unk> Primetime to hype the fight . He was defeated by <unk> for the title by TKO in the first round . 
 On January 11 , 2011 , <unk> was announced as a coach of The Ultimate Fighter Season 13 , opposite Junior dos Santos , with the two expected to fight on June 11 at <unk> 131 , however , he was struck with another bout of <unk> and had to withdraw from the fight on May 12 . He was replaced by Shane <unk> , who ended up losing against dos Santos . <unk> underwent surgery on May 27 to help battle his problems with <unk> . Dana White said that he had a 12 @-@ inch piece of his <unk> removed . 
 In its May 2011 issue , ESPN 's magazine published a story listing the highest paid athlete based on base salary and earnings for the most recent calendar year or most recent season in 30 sports . <unk> topped the list for <unk> at $ 5 @.@ 3 million , which included his reported bout salaries and estimated pay @-@ per @-@ view bonuses . 
 Though <unk> said he was " closing the door on <unk> " in March 2015 , <unk> announced on June 4 , 2016 , that he would return at <unk> 200 on July 9 . WWE confirmed it had granted <unk> " a one @-@ off opportunity " to compete at <unk> 200 before he would return to the company for SummerSlam on August 21 . 
 <unk> , representing Canada for the first time in his career , defeated Mark Hunt by unanimous decision ( 29 @-@ 27 ) , avoiding 19 of Hunt 's 30 attempted standing strikes , and taking him down four times to land 43 significant ground strikes , 32 in the final round . He also won a <unk> @-@ record $ 2 @.@ 5 million <unk> .

 <unk> is a conservative and a supporter of the Republican Party . He is a member of the National Rifle Association , and made an appearance at their annual meeting in May 2011 to discuss his passion for hunting and his role as a spokesman for <unk> <unk> . 
 During his first run in WWE , <unk> developed <unk> to both alcohol and <unk> , allegedly drinking a bottle of <unk> per day and taking hundreds of <unk> <unk> per month to manage the pain caused by wear and tear on his body ; he named his accident at WrestleMania <unk> as a particular source of pain . <unk> claims that , as a result of his addiction and mental exhaustion , he does not remember " an entire two years " of his WWE career . 
 In January 2001 , <unk> was arrested by police in Louisville , Kentucky for suspicion of possessing large amounts of anabolic steroids . The charges were dropped when it was discovered that the substances were a legal growth hormone . His lawyer described it as a " <unk> type of thing " . 
 On December 15 , 2011 , <unk> was charged with hunting <unk> on a trip to Alberta on November 19 , 2010 . Two charges were dropped , but <unk> pleaded guilty to the charge of improper <unk> of an animal . He was fined $ 1 @,@ 725 and given a six @-@ month hunting suspension .

 Constant k <unk> , also k @-@ type <unk> , are a type of electronic filter designed using the image method . They are the original and simplest <unk> produced by this methodology and consist of a ladder network of identical sections of passive components . Historically , they are the first <unk> that could approach the ideal filter frequency response to within any prescribed limit with the addition of a sufficient number of sections . However , they are rarely considered for a modern design , the principles behind them having been superseded by other methodologies which are more accurate in their prediction of filter response . 
 Constant k <unk> were invented by George Campbell . He published his work in 1922 , but had clearly invented the <unk> some time before , as his colleague at AT & T Co , Otto <unk> , was already making improvements to the design at this time . Campbell 's <unk> were far superior to the simpler single element circuits that had been used previously . Campbell called his <unk> electric wave <unk> , but this term later came to mean any filter that passes waves of some frequencies but not others . Many new forms of wave filter were subsequently invented ; an early ( and important ) variation was the m @-@ derived filter by <unk> who coined the term constant k for the Campbell filter in order to distinguish them . 
 The great advantage Campbell 's <unk> had over the <unk> circuit and other simple <unk> of the time was that they could be designed for any desired degree of stop band rejection or <unk> of transition between pass band and stop band . It was only necessary to add more filter sections until the desired response was obtained . 
 The <unk> were designed by Campbell for the purpose of separating <unk> telephone channels on transmission lines , but their subsequent use has been much more widespread than that . The design techniques used by Campbell have largely been superseded . However , the ladder <unk> used by Campbell with the constant k is still in use today with <unk> of modern filter designs such as the <unk> filter . Campbell gave constant k designs for low @-@ pass , high @-@ pass and band @-@ pass <unk> . Band @-@ stop and multiple band <unk> are also possible . 
 Some of the <unk> terms and section terms used in this article are pictured in the diagram below . Image theory defines quantities in terms of an infinite cascade of two @-@ port sections , and in the case of the <unk> being discussed , an infinite ladder network of L @-@ sections . Here " L " should not be confused with the <unk> L – in electronic filter <unk> , " L " refers to the specific filter shape which resembles inverted letter " L " . 
 Parts of this article or section rely on the reader 's knowledge of the complex <unk> representation of <unk> and <unk> and on knowledge of the frequency domain representation of signals . 
 The building block of constant k <unk> is the half @-@ section " L " network , composed of a series <unk> Z , and a <unk> <unk> <unk> The " k " in " constant k " is the value given by , 
 Elements L and C can be made <unk> small while retaining the same value of k . Z and Y however , are both approaching zero , and from the formulae ( below ) for image <unk> , 
 Given that the filter does not contain any <unk> elements , the image <unk> in the pass band of the filter is purely real and in the stop band it is purely imaginary . For example , for the pictured low @-@ pass half @-@ section , 
 For the low @-@ pass L @-@ shape section , below the cut @-@ off frequency , the transmission parameters are given by 
 That is , the transmission is <unk> in the pass @-@ band with only the phase of the signal changing . Above the cut @-@ off frequency , the transmission parameters are : 
 The presented plots of image <unk> , <unk> and phase change correspond to a low @-@ pass prototype filter section . The prototype has a cut @-@ off frequency of <unk> 
 1 <unk> . This prototype can be <unk> scaled and frequency scaled to the desired values . The low @-@ pass prototype can also be transformed into high @-@ pass , band @-@ pass or band @-@ stop types by application of suitable frequency <unk> . 
 Several L @-@ shape half @-@ sections may be <unk> to form a composite filter . Like <unk> must always face like in these combinations . There are therefore two circuits that can be formed with two identical L @-@ shaped half @-@ sections . Where a port of image <unk> <unk> faces another <unk> , the section is called a <unk> section . Where <unk> faces <unk> the section so formed is a T section . Further additions of half @-@ sections to either of these section forms a ladder network which may start and end with series or <unk> elements . 
 It should be borne in mind that the characteristics of the filter predicted by the image method are only accurate if the section is terminated with its image <unk> . This is usually not true of the sections at either end , which are usually terminated with a fixed resistance . The further the section is from the end of the filter , the more accurate the prediction will become , since the effects of the terminating <unk> are masked by the intervening sections . 
 " The <unk> " is an episode of the British science fiction television series Doctor Who , first broadcast on Christmas Day 2012 on BBC One . It is the eighth Christmas special since the show 's 2005 revival and the first to be within a series . It was written by head writer and executive producer Steven Moffat and directed by Saul <unk> . 
 Building upon the character 's surprise introduction in " Asylum of the <unk> " , " The <unk> " introduces <unk> as the Doctor 's new companion , though ultimately it would be a third version of her character that would travel with the Doctor starting with " The Bells of Saint John " . In addition to <unk> , " The <unk> " also introduces a redesigned <unk> , revised title sequence and theme music , and sees changes to the Doctor 's costume . The special was produced in August 2012 , with location filming in Newport , Wales and Bristol . It received final ratings of 9 @.@ 87 million viewers in the UK , becoming the fourth most @-@ watched programme of Christmas Day . " The <unk> " was met with mostly positive reviews from critics , most of whom received the introduction and character of <unk> well . However , some felt that Grant and <unk> were <unk> as villains or the plot was slight because of the focus on characterisation . 
 To promote the special , three <unk> were released . The first was broadcast during the 2012 Children in Need <unk> on 16 November 2012 , titled " The Great Detective " . The <unk> Madame <unk> , her human wife Jenny Flint , and the <unk> <unk> ( all returning from " A Good Man Goes to War " ) describe a number of strange phenomena to a shadowed fourth detective . The fourth detective reveals himself to be the Doctor , and tells the group that he has retired . 
 A third prequel , titled " The Battle of Demon 's Run — Two Days Later " was released on the United States iTunes and Amazon Video stores on 25 March 2013 . Two days after the events of " A Good Man Goes to War " , <unk> and Jenny convince <unk> that he is not mortally wounded and invite him to accompany them back to 1800s London . The scene had been filmed as an extra due to the anticipation that fans would ask how <unk> was resurrected and came to be in <unk> 's employ . 
 In 1842 England , a young boy builds a <unk> , but refuses to play with the other children . The <unk> starts speaking to the boy , repeating his <unk> that the other children are silly . Fifty years later , the boy has grown up to be Dr. Walter <unk> , proprietor of the Great Intelligence Institute . He hires men to collect samples of snow , which he places in a large snow @-@ filled globe in his laboratory before feeding the men to a group of animated <unk> . The Doctor , still <unk> after losing his former companions Amy Pond and Rory Williams , has parked his <unk> above Victorian London among the clouds . He uses his allies <unk> , Jenny , and <unk> to keep people away from him . They also fill their time investigating mysteries throughout the city . 
 The Second Doctor previously encountered the Great Intelligence in the serials The <unk> <unk> ( 1967 ) , set in the 1930s , and The Web of Fear ( 1968 ) , set in the 1960s . In these stories , the Great Intelligence uses robot <unk> as its physical presence . The events of The Web of Fear are alluded to by the Doctor in " The <unk> " when he presents the London Underground <unk> tin to the Great Intelligence in Dr <unk> 's laboratory ; the Intelligence states , " I do not understand these markings " , in reference to the 1967 London Underground map design on the tin . The Doctor remarks that the Underground is a " key strategic weakness in metropolitan living " , referring to ( and possibly setting in motion ) the future <unk> attack on London via the Underground . 
 Writer Steven Moffat stated that he wanted an " epic " quality to the Christmas special . The story would also show how the Doctor had responded to losing his previous companions ; Moffat said that " I think he 's probably reached the point in his life where he 's saying , ' Friendship for me is just postponed <unk> — I want to be on my own for a while ' . " Moffat compared the withdrawn Doctor seen at the onset of the episode to the first appearances of the First Doctor ( William <unk> ) in 1963 and the <unk> Doctor ( Christopher Eccleston ) in 2005 . He also attributed the idea of a retired Doctor to a plot proposed by Douglas Adams in the 1970s , but rejected by the production team at the time . Continuing the theme introduced with the series ' first five episodes , " The <unk> " was promoted like a movie . A movie poster was released in the Radio Times , showing the Doctor and <unk> ascending the ladder to the <unk> . 
 The episode saw several major design changes for the series . " The <unk> " is the debut of a redesigned <unk> interior , as well as a new title sequence and variation of the theme tune . The new title sequence features a brief glimpse of the Doctor 's face , the first time since Survival , the final serial of the classic series in 1989 , that the Doctor 's face has been seen in the title sequence . Moffat had noticed that the <unk> ' design was getting " progressively whimsical " and resembled more of a " magical place " rather than a machine . It was designed by series production designer Michael <unk> , who stated that the new interior was also supposed to be " darker and <unk> " and provide an easier access to the " gallery " of the ship when shooting . 
 The Doctor also wears a one @-@ off costume , Victorian @-@ themed , which Smith described as " a bit <unk> <unk> meets the Doctor " . Moffat described the new outfit as a " progression " as the Doctor was in " a different phase of his life now " and felt more " grown @-@ up " and <unk> . The costume was designed by Howard <unk> for this episode . " The <unk> " also contains several references to Sherlock Holmes , including the Doctor dressing up as him . Moffat is co @-@ creator of the BBC series Sherlock , for which Smith auditioned for the role of Doctor Watson before being cast as the Doctor . In addition , the incidental music during the scene bears a resemblance to the Sherlock theme . 
 This episode marks the return of Jenna @-@ Louise Coleman , who previously appeared in the series opener , " Asylum of the <unk> " . Coleman was cast because of her chemistry with Matt Smith , and especially because she was able to talk faster than him . She auditioned for the role of <unk> , not <unk> from " Asylum " , as the concept of the two characters being the same only occurred to Moffat whilst casting for <unk> . The production team requested that the press and fans who attended advanced screenings keep Coleman 's appearance a secret until " Asylum " was broadcast ; the effort was ultimately successful . Moffat stated that the introduction of a new companion made " the show feel different " and brought the story to " a new beginning " with a different person meeting the Doctor . Smith said that <unk> was different from her predecessor Amy Pond ( Karen <unk> ) , which allowed the audience to see a different side of the Doctor . Coleman described her as resourceful and not intimidated , citing the reason for following the Doctor at the beginning as pursuing answers . The <unk> who would become a travelling companion of the Doctor would not debut until the Spring premiere , " The Bells of Saint John " ; save for a brief cameo at the end of " The <unk> " . Coleman stated that she played each version as individuals with " trust that there would be a payoff " to her mystery . 
 " The <unk> " was originally intended to be produced in the fourth production block of the series and be the first episode Coleman shot as her character ; however , it did not begin filming until the week of 6 August 2012 , after Coleman had worked on later episodes while Moffat was writing the Christmas special . The read @-@ through had taken place on 2 August 2012 . This was the first Christmas special to be filmed in BBC Wales ' new <unk> Lock studios . Scenes featuring Coleman and several guest stars in a Victorian setting were filmed in Newport , Wales , while Coleman and Smith were also spotted filming in Bristol two weeks later on 21 August . Some scenes which used snow props were filmed in Portland Square , Bristol , where filming took place overnight on 21 – 22 August 2012 . Bristol was chosen because it had Victorian @-@ era architecture . <unk> stated that his favourite set is the London Street with the back of the pub , which he said was based on a sixteenth @-@ century building in Oxford . The locations were blocked off and <unk> with fake snow . 
 The <unk> on the cloud was achieved through a mix of fog on the studio floor and post @-@ production special effects . Director Saul <unk> explained that it was difficult to achieve the desired look for the <unk> ; the first ones he likened to <unk> from Rainbow which was too " cute " of an appearance , and so the effects team created more menacing CGI faces . <unk> 's introduction to the <unk> introduced two novel effects for the show . The first was a single @-@ shot camera tracking from a few feet away from the <unk> to its interior , with the implication of the <unk> 's trans @-@ dimensional nature shown to the audience . In the following shot , the camera does a complete circle of the <unk> console , an effect not seen since the early days of the show . <unk> wanted to include this shot to further emphasize the " bigger on the inside than the outside " nature of the time machine . 
 In addition to the three prequel mini @-@ episodes , the cast also filmed an additional promotional video , " <unk> <unk> , " which the BBC uploaded during the days leading up to the broadcast . The video featured <unk> singing modified versions of several Christmas songs in character as <unk> as his <unk> look on , before everyone breaks character and begins laughing . 
 " The <unk> " aired on BBC One on 25 December 2012 at 5 : 15 pm , the same day on BBC America in the US and Space in Canada and the next day on <unk> in Australia and on Prime in New Zealand . UK overnight ratings showed that the special had been watched by 7 @.@ 6 million viewers , coming in sixth for the night . Final consolidated figures ( not including BBC <unk> viewers ) showed that the episode was watched by 9 @.@ 87 million viewers , coming in fourth for the night . It also received an <unk> Index figure of 87 , higher than most of the Doctor Who Christmas <unk> . The <unk> version had 1 @,@ 467 @,@ 220 views , making it the most popular TV show on <unk> over Christmas . The US airing was seen by 1 @.@ 43 million viewers , with a 0 @.@ 6 rating in the demographic of adults aged 18 – 49 . 
 The Mirror 's Jon Cooper also praised Coleman and the new side of the Doctor that was shown , comparing it to Rose Tyler ( Billie Piper ) challenging the <unk> Doctor ( Christopher Eccleston ) . However , he felt the character @-@ heavy story was to the <unk> of the plot , which was " a classic Who set @-@ up that ultimately suffers from a lack of explanation [ and ] more set @-@ pieces than a coherent whole " . He felt that the episode may not have been accessible for casual viewers , but offered much for fans in time for the programme 's fiftieth anniversary . Dominic <unk> of The Daily Telegraph gave " The <unk> " three out of five stars , disappointed that it was not as scary as it had been <unk> to be . While he was positive towards Smith and the <unk> on the cloud , he criticised <unk> and the " <unk> @-@ like complexity " of the script . 
 The episode was nominated for the 2013 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation ( Short Form ) , alongside " Asylum of the <unk> " and " The Angels Take Manhattan " , but lost to the Game of <unk> episode " <unk> " . 
 " The <unk> " was initially released as a standalone on DVD and Blu @-@ ray in the UK and North America . It was later included as part of the DVD / Blu @-@ ray box set Doctor Who : The Complete Seventh Series in September 2013 . 
 It has subsequently been reissued in several box set compilations , most recently alongside the Christmas <unk> between " The Christmas Invasion " and " Last Christmas " inclusive in a <unk> titled Doctor Who – The 10 Christmas <unk> on 19 October 2015 . 
 Selected pieces of score from " The <unk> " and the preceding Christmas special , as composed by Murray Gold , were included on a soundtrack released on 21 October 2013 by Silva Screen Records . 
 No. 20 Squadron is a Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) support squadron . Coming under the control of No. 96 Wing , it is responsible for the management of the airfield at RAAF Base <unk> , South Australia . The squadron originated as a maritime patrol unit during World War II . <unk> in August 1941 , it operated <unk> <unk> and Short Empire flying boats from bases in New Guinea , Queensland and the Northern Territory , conducting search @-@ and @-@ rescue , mine @-@ laying , anti @-@ submarine and bombing missions against Japanese targets in the Pacific theatre . Following the conclusion of hostilities , the squadron was disbanded in March 1946 . It was reactivated as an airfield support squadron in April 2015 . 
 No. 20 Squadron was formed at Port Moresby , New Guinea , on 1 August 1941 for a general reconnaissance role , under the command of Squadron Leader <unk> Gibson . Its establishment was six <unk> <unk> flying boats and 133 personnel , but only five aircraft ( all transferred from No. 11 Squadron ) and 55 personnel were available initially . The squadron conducted long @-@ range patrols between bases scattered around the islands to Australia 's north in conjunction with No. 11 Squadron . On 18 November , No. 20 Squadron 's Catalinas were augmented by two Short Empire flying boats transferred from No. 11 Squadron . 
 On 25 November 1941 , following the loss of <unk> Sydney , one of No. 20 Squadron 's Catalinas was despatched to Western Australia to join a No. 11 Squadron <unk> in search @-@ and @-@ rescue missions , but they found only oil <unk> . By the outbreak of war in the Pacific , No. 20 Squadron had a strength of six Catalinas and two Empire flying boats . Its personnel at the beginning of December numbered 14 officers and 118 men . The squadron undertook its first sortie of the Pacific War on 8 December ; a <unk> located three Japanese <unk> in the vicinity of Thursday Island , Queensland . Later in the month it commenced anti @-@ submarine patrols and , in January 1942 , bombing raids against Japanese bases . As the Japanese advanced into the South West Pacific , No. 20 Squadron was also responsible for evacuating white civilians from areas threatened by invasion . On 21 January , one of its Catalinas located the Japanese fleet steaming for Rabaul and signalled a warning to the town 's Australian defenders before being shot down by anti @-@ aircraft fire ; it was the squadron 's first combat loss . 
 In the wake of the fall of Rabaul , the Catalinas of Nos. 11 and 20 Squadrons became the RAAF 's only offensive weapon against the Japanese . Their raids on Rabaul did little to stem the Japanese advance , and in the following months Port Moresby itself was subjected to increasingly frequent attacks , which destroyed aircraft , facilities , and squadron records . In February 1942 , the Short <unk> operated by Nos. 11 and 20 Squadrons were transferred to the newly formed No. 33 ( Transport ) Squadron . No. 20 Squadron lost two Catalinas during patrols on 4 and 6 May ; the nine crewmen of the first were later found to have been captured and beheaded ; the crew of the second were also captured and subsequently disappeared without trace . 
 In response to the threat of invasion at Port Moresby , Nos. 11 and 20 Squadrons moved to Bowen , Queensland , on 7 May 1942 . They were soon attacking Japanese targets in Lae , <unk> and Rabaul . On 27 June , each squadron contributed an aircraft to a four @-@ hour raid over Lae and <unk> during which , as well as bombs , the RAAF crews dropped beer bottles to disrupt the enemy soldiers ' sleep — the sound they made falling through the air was , according to the official history , " something between a <unk> whistle and a scream " . By 1 July , No. 20 Squadron 's strength was six Catalinas and 175 personnel , out of a planned establishment of nine aircraft and 415 personnel . Its prime responsibility in early 1942 was maritime reconnaissance as far as New Guinea , the Solomon Islands , and New Caledonia ; the latter half of the year saw a greater focus on night bombing . Now comprising 252 officers and men , the squadron relocated to Cairns on 11 November 1942 . From Cairns it continued to conduct reconnaissance , anti @-@ submarine and occasional bombing operations over the waters around New Guinea . Between December 1942 and March 1943 , No. 20 Squadron 's aircraft flew a total of 9 @,@ <unk> hours and dropped 227 tons of bombs . The squadron 's role changed in June 1943 when it commenced mine @-@ laying operations over the Netherlands East Indies and the Philippines , though it continued to make some bombing raids and supply drops . 
 In September 1944 , No. 20 Squadron became part of No. 76 Wing RAAF , along with Nos. 42 and 43 Squadrons , and moved to Darwin , Northern Territory . All three squadrons operated Catalinas , their primary purpose being mine @-@ laying . On the night of 30 September , a <unk> of No. 20 Squadron was shot down while attacking a ship at <unk> in the Dutch East Indies ; the loss was compounded by the fact that one of the <unk> of the mining campaign , Lieutenant Commander <unk> Carr of the Royal Australian Navy , was aboard the plane and was captured by the Japanese . Another of the squadron 's Catalinas went down on the night of 27 / 28 January 1945 , possibly in a cyclone over the Timor Sea , during the campaign to mine <unk> . In March , a detachment of four No. 20 Squadron aircraft , along with four from No. 43 Squadron , laid mines off the coast of southern China and <unk> as part of a No. 76 Wing offensive in this area ; these operations were conducted from <unk> Gulf in the Philippines . One of No. 20 Squadron 's Catalinas was lost on the night of 7 / 8 March , most likely owing to bad weather rather than enemy action . Three of the squadron 's aircraft mined the entrance to Hong Kong harbour on 8 April and , on 26 May , four of its Catalinas mined <unk> harbour in China , the <unk> north that any Australian aircraft infiltrated during the war in the Pacific . Three of its aircraft flew the RAAF 's last mine @-@ laying mission on 30 July . 
 No. 20 Squadron 's final wartime sortie was a patrol on 14 August 1945 . Following the end of the war , the squadron operated in the transport role and ferried Australian prisoners of war home from various locations in South East Asia . It relocated to RAAF Station <unk> , New South Wales , on 21 November . No. 20 Squadron flew its last mission , a transport flight to <unk> , on 21 January 1946 , and disbanded at <unk> on 27 March . 
 No. 20 Squadron was reactivated on 1 April 2015 to support airfield operations at RAAF Base <unk> , South Australia . <unk> of nine <unk> personnel and one Australian Public Service member under the command of Squadron Leader Simon Bartlett , the squadron formed part of No. 96 Wing , a component of Combat Support Group ( <unk> ) . The airfield had previously been managed under the auspices of <unk> Operational Support Group , but a command @-@ and @-@ control review commissioned by the Chief of Air Force recommended that , in common with other RAAF airfields , it should be administered by <unk> . RAAF Base <unk> , incorporating <unk> Village , was one of two Air Force units formally established on 12 January 2015 as part of a reorganisation of the <unk> Range Complex , the other unit being RAAF <unk> Test Range . 
 The design of the reactivated squadron 's crest includes a wedge @-@ tailed eagle to denote courage and nobility , a <unk> spear <unk> to symbolise the town and its indigenous heritage , Sturt 's Desert <unk> to represent South Australia , and the <unk> star cluster , which features in the folklore of the local <unk> people . 
 The Light Tank Mk VII ( <unk> ) , also known as the <unk> , was a British light tank produced by Vickers @-@ <unk> in the late 1930s and deployed during the World War II . The <unk> was originally designed as the latest in the line of light tanks built by the company for the British Army . It improved upon its predecessor , the Mk <unk> Light Tank , by introducing the extra firepower of a 2 @-@ pounder gun . The War Office ordered 70 tanks , an order that eventually increased to 220 . Production was delayed by several factors , and as a consequence , only 100 to 177 of the tanks were produced . 
 The tank 's design flaws , combined with the decision by the War Office not to use light tanks in British armoured divisions , ruled out the use of <unk> in the North African Campaign . As a result , the majority of the tanks remained in Britain , although 20 were sent to the USSR as part of the <unk> @-@ <unk> program . In early 1941 , the Royal Armoured Corps formed three squadrons for use in overseas amphibious operations , one of which was equipped with <unk> . In May 1942 , a small number of <unk> formed part of the British force which participated in the invasion of Madagascar , and , in June 1942 , <unk> were attached to the 1st Airborne Division after it was decided that the design allowed its use as an air @-@ portable light tank to support British airborne forces . The <unk> were transported and landed in specially designed General Aircraft <unk> gliders . A lack of gliders prevented their participation in the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943 ; instead they were attached to the new 6th Airborne Division and became part of the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment . 
 The division used approximately 20 <unk> during the British airborne landings in Normandy in June 1944 . The tanks were successfully landed by glider , but they did not perform well . Several were lost in accidents , and those that did see action proved to be inferior in firepower and armour to the armoured fighting vehicles of the German forces . A few days after the beginning of the operation , the tanks were removed from direct engagement with German armour and used only to provide fire support . By August 1944 , most of the <unk> in action were replaced with Cromwell cruiser tanks , and the remainder were replaced by the <unk> <unk> in December 1944 . 
 <unk> did not see any further combat and were deemed obsolete by 1946 ; the last was retired in 1950 . There were several variations on the <unk> design , including the <unk> self @-@ propelled gun and the Light Tank Mk VIII , but none of these were ever used in active service with the British Army . 
 The War Office examined the design and put the prototype through a series of trials during May and June 1938 ; the model was tested as a possible " light cruiser " since War Office light tank needs were already met by its predecessor , the Mark VI . The War Office then took the view that the tank was not acceptable as a light cruiser because the <unk> <unk> offered better speed and obstacle crossing performance . Despite this , it was decided that it was essential for some <unk> to be produced , and it was suggested that they be brought in at the end of the light tank program . Accordingly , the War Office gave the <unk> the official General Staff specification number <unk> , and , in November 1938 , accepted it for limited production after requesting a few minor changes which included the fitting of an external fuel tank to increase the tank 's range . 
 The number to be produced was subject to <unk> as the War Office <unk> in their demand ; in July 1938 , it requested that 70 of the tanks be produced , then increased the request to 120 after a three @-@ day conference in November . Production was to begin in July 1940 , but meanwhile the War Office temporarily returned to its original order of 70 before increasing the number to 100 . The number further increased to 220 after Metropolitan <unk> Carriage and <unk> , a company part owned by Vickers @-@ Armstrong that would be producing the tanks , indicated it had already ordered armour plating for that many tanks . 
 Production of the tank was delayed by a number of factors . The War Office put their order on hold in a post @-@ Battle of France decision to focus military production on infantry and cruiser tanks , due to the poor performance of British light tanks during that battle . Due to the shortage of more suitable tanks , light tanks that were not designed for use against German armour , were nevertheless deployed against them ; the resulting high casualties led the War Office to re @-@ evaluate the suitability of the light tank design . The pre @-@ war role of the light tank , that of reconnaissance , meanwhile had been found to be better suited to scout cars that used smaller crews and had better cross @-@ country abilities . Further delays were caused by the bombing raids of the Luftwaffe during May 1941 against the factories where the tanks were assembled . 
 The cumulative effect of these delays resulted in the production of only a small number of Mk <unk> ; estimates place the final total produced to be between 100 and 177 . The name ' <unk> ' was given to the Mk VII , on 22 September 1941 , on the orders of the War Office . The last of the tanks were built in the first quarter of 1942 and delivered at the end of the year . 
 The War Office and the Army were concluding , at this point , that light tanks were a liability and too vulnerable for use in further combat , and the <unk> was considered to be obsolete . This decision may have marked the end for the <unk> in active service ; several of the tanks destined to be deployed to the Eighth Army in the Middle East for the North African Campaign were left in Britain when their cooling systems were determined to be unable to cope with the intense North African heat . 
 The demise of <unk> was prevented by a decision made by the War Office in mid @-@ 1941 , as it was considering the equipment to be used by Britain 's fledgling airborne forces , formed in June 1940 under the orders of the Prime Minister , Winston Churchill . When selecting the equipment for the airborne forces , officials at the War Office concluded that gliders would be an integral component ; gliders would transport troops and heavy equipment , which , by 1941 , was to include artillery and some form of tank . Plans to transport a tank went through a number of revisions , but , by May 1941 , the feasibility of a 5 @.@ 5 metric tons ( 5 @.@ 4 long tons ) tank to be carried for 350 miles ( 560 km ) in a glider was accepted , although the aircraft would have to be specifically designed for the task . In a conference held on 16 January 1941 , it was decided that the General Aircraft <unk> , currently under development , would be used to transport a single <unk> tank or two Universal <unk> . The <unk> was chosen because it was an obsolete design , and was therefore available to be used by the airborne forces . 
 A number of design faults of the <unk> were revealed through its operational use . Its size limited the possible crew to three , a driver in the hull and a gunner and commander in the turret , resulting in too few crew members to operate the <unk> effectively . The gunner or commander , in addition to his own duties , had to act as <unk> for the 2 pounder , which caused delays in combat . A report on the tank written in January 1941 stated that as the commander had to both fight and control the tank , controlling a troop of <unk> during combat would be almost impossible . 
 Problems were also found with the <unk> <unk> fitted to the 2 @-@ pounder to increase its range and penetration power ; after they had been fitted the <unk> could not be removed , and could only fire specially designed armour @-@ piercing rounds , which took time to manufacture . 
 The War Office also considered the <unk> 's cooling system faulty , making the tank unsuitable for service in <unk> climates , such as the Middle East and North Africa . 
 The first <unk> were delivered to the Army in November 1940 , and were initially deployed with the 1st Armoured Division ( which was being refitted after losing the majority of its previous tanks during the Battle of France ) and the newly formed 6th Armoured Division . However , the faults discovered with the <unk> cooling system precluded them from being integrated into units that were sent to the Middle East to participate in the North African Campaign . Shortly after , all light tanks were discarded from the establishments of British armoured divisions as not suitable for further service . 
 In mid @-@ 1941 , the Royal Armoured Corps in Britain created three tank squadrons for special overseas operations , known as ' A ' , ' B ' and ' C ' Special Service Squadrons . Both ' A ' and ' B ' Squadrons were equipped with Valentine Infantry tanks and Mark <unk> light tanks , but ' C ' Squadron was equipped with twelve <unk> transferred from the 2nd Armoured Brigade , 1st Armoured Division . On 31 July 1941 , ' C ' Squadron was officially activated and immediately received orders to prepare for overseas service alongside ' A ' and ' B ' Squadrons in an unspecified tropical climate . All three squadrons were transported to <unk> in Scotland for intensive training that focused on embarkation and <unk> from ships and landing craft to prepare them for action in potential amphibious operations . In early September , elements of ' C ' Squadron , including six <unk> , formed part of a force which sailed for Freetown in West Africa ; during this period of the war there were fears that the Spanish government might enter the conflict on the side of Germany , and the force was <unk> to capture a number of Spanish islands off the coast of Africa if this occurred . These fears proved <unk> , and in March 1942 , the unit returned to Britain to join the rest of the squadron in training . 
 The commander of the <unk> made his report , and was then ordered to take command of four <unk> and two <unk> which had recently arrived and once again attempt to breach the French defences . The tanks followed the road leading to the defensive line and then attempted to out @-@ flank the line by advancing from the right @-@ hand side , using several hills as cover ; the artillery pieces were able to turn and face the assault , however , and one Valentine and one <unk> were hit and destroyed . The remaining tanks exchanged several <unk> of fire with the artillery pieces before retreating back to their original positions . The French line was eventually broken by 29th Brigade , aided by an amphibious assault by Royal Marines ; the remaining tanks of ' B ' Squadron , two <unk> and three <unk> , remained in defensive positions until the afternoon of 6 May , coming under sporadic artillery fire which disabled another Valentine . The squadron played no further part in the battle , as the <unk> French authorities negotiated a formal surrender the following day , although French troops would continue to engage the British occupying force in guerrilla warfare until late November . ' C ' Squadron suffered heavy casualties during the invasion ; only one Valentine and three <unk> out of twelve tanks were functional by 7 May , and the squadron had suffered seven killed and six wounded . It remained in Madagascar until early 1943 , when it was shipped to India and took part in the Burma Campaign as part of 29th Brigade . 
 Because of a lack of equipment training facilities in mid @-@ 1940 , when the British airborne establishment was formed , the War Office was able to accept only 500 volunteers for training as airborne troops . Progress in setting up proper training facilities and acquiring suitable transport aircraft was so slow that the first British airborne operation , Operation <unk> , was conducted by a <unk> Commando unit . By 1942 , there existed specifically trained airborne units , including the 1st Airborne Division , and on 19 January 1942 the War Office decided that a light tank unit would be one of the support units attached to the division . This unit , designated the Light Tank Squadron , was to be formed of nineteen light tanks and would operate to the fore of the division , using their tanks ' speed to capture objectives and then holding them until relieved by other units . The obvious unit for conversion was ' C ' Special Services Squadron , as it was trained to act as an independent tank unit and , more importantly , was the only unit that was still using <unk> ; it had been re @-@ designated as an airborne tank by the War Office . ' C ' Squadron was officially transferred to the 1st Airborne Division on 24 June 1942 , bringing with it seven <unk> among its other vehicles . The unit immediately began training , but was not attached to the 1st Airborne Division for long ; during mid @-@ 1943 , the division was transported to the Middle East so it could participate in the Allied invasion of Sicily . ' C ' Squadron remained in Britain , as not enough <unk> gliders had been built by the time the division departed to transport its <unk> ; the squadron was transferred to the 6th Airborne Division , which had been raised in April 1943 , and ' C ' Squadron remained with it for the rest of the conflict . The squadron continued to train as an air @-@ portable unit , and participated in a number of exercises to prepare for its new duties , including reconnaissance of enemy positions and counter @-@ attacking enemy infantry and armour . 
 <unk> was released to mostly positive reviews from video game journalists . The game was universally lauded for its graphics , with magazines like Sega Pro describing them as " some of the best graphics around . " The game was also praised for its music and puzzles , as well as their clever use in the game . However , <unk> was criticized for its controls , being described by IGN as " float @-@ y " and making certain segments of the game <unk> difficult . The game was also criticized for its lack of difficulty overall as well as its lack of speech samples , which several other Genesis games of the time had . 
 The player , as Donald , ventures through a variety of side @-@ scrolling levels . Generally , each level is divided into an overland part and a dungeon , such as the <unk> 's palace or the temple in which the Great Duck Treasure resides . Although the player may choose any order to play the overland sections , various obstacles prevent the player from entering the <unk> outside of a specific order . In addition to this , some levels provide the player with vital clues which solve puzzles needed to progress in later sections . Once Donald has completed the overland section of an area , he may leave by calling his nephews ' biplane , and will return to the dungeon entrance of that area if the player chooses to return . 
 While Donald is <unk> through some books in <unk> <unk> 's library , a map falls out of a book relating to the treasure of King <unk> , ruler of the Great Duck Kingdom in ancient times . The map leads to the location of the king 's most prized possession , hidden in a secret place shortly before his death . Donald thinks this is his path to riches . Unfortunately Big Bad Pete <unk> and pursues Donald throughout the game hoping to steal the treasure . 
 However , upon finding the diary , Pete shows up , holding Donald 's nephews hostage in exchange for the diary . After giving Pete the diary , Donald travels to Pete 's hideout to defeat Pete and get the diary back . The diary reveals that the map , when dipped in water , will reveal the location of the Great Duck Treasure . Donald flies to the island where the treasure is hidden and manages to evade its traps in order to reach the treasure vault . After defeating the ancient spirit guarding the treasure , Donald opens the vault only to find a simple stone statue . When the disappointed Donald returns home , Huey , <unk> and <unk> accidentally break the statue , which reveals a golden <unk> necklace was hidden inside . Donald gives the necklace to Daisy and the two fly off into the sunset together . 
 <unk> was developed and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis as part of a series of games that were based on Walt Disney cartoon characters . The game was released in Europe in 1991 , in North America on December 19 , 1991 and in Japan on December 20 , 1991 . <unk> was later released as part of a bundle called The Disney Collection for Genesis in 1996 alongside Castle of Illusion . The game was also ported to the Sega Saturn and released exclusively in Japan alongside Castle of Illusion again as part of the Sega Ages series in 1998 , entitled Sega Ages : I Love Mickey Mouse . 
 <unk> received a mostly positive response from critics upon release . GameRankings , an aggregator for video game reviews , assigned the game a score of 77 % based on 2 reviews . Mega placed the game at # 7 in their " Top Mega Drive Games of All Time " list . <unk> magazine praised the game 's graphics , but criticized the game 's easy difficulty level , explaining simply that " the graphics are excellent , but the game is easy to complete . " Damian <unk> from Sega Pro also praised the graphics , stating that the game has " without [ a ] doubt some of the best graphics around " and that " the sprites and backgrounds are consistently excellent . " He also noted the game 's various puzzles and their use in the game , explaining that " [ e ] <unk> if the ideas are not original , the way they are strung together to accelerate the pace to <unk> is nothing short of breath @-@ taking . " Levi Buchanan from IGN gave <unk> a 7 @.@ 3 / 10 , also lauding the graphics and animation as excellent and saying the music was pleasing . 
 <unk> criticized Donald 's controls in certain situations in the game , as well as the difficulty of some levels and puzzles . Buchanan also criticized the controls , calling them " float @-@ y " and noted the difficulty in executing precision jumps , explaining that " [ i ] t 's far too easy to <unk> or under @-@ shoot a narrow column and slip to your <unk> . " <unk> was also " dubious of the number of credits , " stating that the game may seem easy with unlimited continues , but that the player will " still need considerable skill to reach the treasure island . " Buchanan was disappointed with the lack of speech samples , explaining that it 's " a bit of a drag with a character that is so defined by his voice . " Ultimately , <unk> said that " [ y ] <unk> players will instantly be <unk> by Donald 's quest " and that " <unk> is everything a cartoon game should be and more . " Buchanan summed up the game as being a " good platformer <unk> up by some questionable controls " and recommended the game as " a <unk> enjoyable 16 @-@ bit platformer that would fit nicely in your Genesis collection .

 The <unk> colossal heads are at least seventeen monumental stone representations of human heads sculpted from large basalt boulders . The heads date from at least before 900 BC and are a distinctive feature of the <unk> civilization of ancient <unk> . All portray mature men with <unk> <unk> , flat <unk> , and slightly crossed eyes ; their physical characteristics correspond to a type that is still common among the inhabitants of <unk> and Veracruz . The backs of the monuments often are flat . The boulders were brought from the Sierra de los <unk> mountains of Veracruz . Given that the extremely large slabs of stone used in their production were transported over large distances , requiring a great deal of human effort and resources , it is thought that the monuments represent portraits of powerful individual <unk> rulers . Each of the known examples has a distinctive headdress . The heads were variously arranged in lines or groups at major <unk> centres , but the method and logistics used to transport the stone to these sites remain unclear . 
 <unk> the monuments remains difficult because of the movement of many from their original contexts prior to archaeological investigation . Most have been dated to the Early <unk> period ( 1500 – 1000 BC ) with some to the Middle <unk> ( 1000 – 400 BC ) period . The smallest weigh 6 tons , while the largest is variously estimated to weigh 40 to 50 tons , although it was abandoned and left unfinished close to the source of its stone . 
 The <unk> were the first inhabitants of the Americas to construct monumental architecture and to settle in towns and cities . They were also the first people in the Americas to develop a sophisticated style of stone sculpture . In the first decade of the 21st century evidence emerged of <unk> writing , with the earliest examples of <unk> hieroglyphs dating to around 650 BC . Examples of script have been found on roller stamps and stone artefacts ; the texts are short and have been partially <unk> based on their similarity to other <unk> scripts . The evidence of complex society developing in the <unk> <unk> has led to the <unk> being regarded as the " Mother Culture " of <unk> , although this concept remains controversial . 
 In the late nineteenth century , José <unk> y Serrano described a colossal head as having " Ethiopian " features and speculations that the <unk> had African origins resurfaced in 1960 in the work of Alfonso <unk> <unk> and in the 1970s in the writings of Ivan van <unk> . Such speculation is not taken seriously by <unk> scholars such as Richard <unk> and Ann <unk> . 
 Although all the colossal heads are broadly similar , there are distinct stylistic differences in their execution . One of the heads from San Lorenzo bears traces of plaster and red paint , suggesting that the heads were originally brightly decorated . Heads did not just represent individual <unk> rulers ; they also incorporated the very concept of rulership itself . 
 The production of each colossal head must have been carefully planned , given the effort required to ensure the necessary resources were available ; it seems likely that only the more powerful <unk> rulers were able to <unk> such resources . The workforce would have included <unk> , labourers , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and other <unk> producing the tools to make and move the monument , in addition to the support needed to feed and otherwise attend to these workers . The seasonal and agricultural cycles and river levels needed to have been taken into account to plan the production of the monument and the whole project may well have taken years from beginning to end . 
 Archaeological investigation of <unk> basalt workshops suggest that the colossal heads were first roughly shaped using direct percussion to chip away both large and small <unk> of stone . The sculpture was then refined by <unk> the surface using <unk> , which were generally rounded <unk> that could be of the same basalt as the monument itself , although this was not always the case . <unk> were found in association with workshops at San Lorenzo , indicating their use in the finishing of fine detail . <unk> colossal heads were fashioned as in @-@ the @-@ round monuments with varying levels of relief on the same work ; they tended to feature higher relief on the face and lower relief on the <unk> and <unk> . Monument 20 at San Lorenzo is an extensively damaged throne with a figure emerging from a niche . Its sides were broken away and it was dragged to another location before being abandoned . It is possible that this damage was caused by the initial stages of re @-@ carving the monument into a colossal head but that the work was never completed . 
 The boulders were transported over 150 kilometres ( 93 mi ) from the source of the stone . The exact method of transportation of such large masses of rock are unknown , especially since the <unk> lacked <unk> of burden and functional wheels , and they were likely to have used water transport whenever possible . Coastal currents of the Gulf of Mexico and in river estuaries might have made the <unk> transport of monuments weighing 20 tons or more impractical . Two badly damaged <unk> sculptures depict rectangular stone blocks bound with ropes . A largely destroyed human figure rides upon each block , with their legs hanging over the side . These sculptures may well depict <unk> rulers overseeing the transport of the stone that would be fashioned into their monuments . When transport over land was necessary , the <unk> are likely to have used <unk> , ramps and roads to facilitate moving the heads . The regional terrain offers significant obstacles such as swamps and floodplains ; avoiding these would have necessitated crossing undulating hill country . The construction of temporary <unk> using the suitable and plentiful floodplain soils would have allowed a direct route across the floodplains to the San Lorenzo Plateau . Earth structures such as mounds , platforms and <unk> upon the plateau demonstrate that the <unk> possessed the necessary knowledge and could commit the resources to build large @-@ scale earthworks . 
 The flat backs of many of the colossal heads represented the flat bases of the monumental <unk> from which they were reworked . Only four of the seventeen <unk> heads do not have flattened backs , indicating the possibility that the majority were reworked monuments . Alternatively , the backs of many of these massive monuments may have been flattened to ease their transport , providing a stable form for <unk> the monuments with ropes . Two heads from San Lorenzo have traces of niches that are characteristic of monumental <unk> <unk> and so were definitely reworked from earlier monuments . 
 Seventeen confirmed examples are known . An additional monument , at <unk> <unk> in Guatemala , is a throne that may have been carved from a colossal head . This is the only known example outside of the <unk> <unk> on the Gulf Coast of Mexico . Possible fragments of additional colossal heads have been recovered at San Lorenzo and at San Fernando in <unk> . <unk> colossal stone heads are also known in the Southern Maya area where they are associated with the <unk> style of sculpture . Although some arguments have been made that they are pre @-@ <unk> , these latter monuments are generally believed to be influenced by the <unk> style of sculpture . 
 The ten colossal heads from San Lorenzo originally formed two roughly parallel lines running north @-@ south across the site . Although some were recovered from <unk> , they were found close to their original <unk> and had been buried by local erosion . These heads , together with a number of monumental stone <unk> , probably formed a processional route across the site , powerfully displaying its dynastic history . Two of the San Lorenzo heads had been re @-@ carved from older <unk> . 
 San Lorenzo <unk> Head 3 is also known as San Lorenzo Monument 3 . The head measures 1 @.@ 78 metres ( 5 @.@ 8 ft ) high by 1 @.@ 63 metres ( 5 @.@ 3 ft ) wide by 0 @.@ 95 metres ( 3 @.@ 1 ft ) deep and weighs 9 @.@ 4 tons . The head was discovered in a deep gully by Matthew <unk> in 1946 ; it was found lying face down and its excavation was difficult due to the wet conditions in the gully . The monument was found 0 @.@ 8 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 50 mi ) southwest of the main mound at San Lorenzo , however , its original location is unknown ; erosion of the gully may have resulted in significant movement of the sculpture . Head 3 has been moved to the <unk> de <unk> de <unk> . The headdress is complex , with the horizontal basal band being formed by four horizontal <unk> , with diagonal folds above each eye . A small <unk> tops the headdress . A large flap formed of four <unk> drops down both sides of the head , completely covering the ears . The face has a typically <unk> brow and , unusually , has clearly defined eyelids . The lips are thick and slightly parted ; the front of the lower lip has broken away completely , and the lower front of the headdress is pitted with 27 irregularly spaced artificial depressions . 
 Three of the La <unk> heads were found in a line running east @-@ west in the northern Complex I ; all three faced northwards , away from the city centre . The other head was found in Complex B to the south of the Great Pyramid , in a plaza that included a number of other sculptures . The latter , the first of the La <unk> heads to be discovered , was found during archaeological exploration of La <unk> in 1925 ; the other three remained unknown to archaeologists until a local boy guided Matthew <unk> to them while he was excavating the first head in 1940 . They were located approximately 0 @.@ 9 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 56 mi ) to the north of Monument 1 . 
 The La <unk> region was the source of the basalt used for carving all of the colossal heads in the <unk> <unk> . The La <unk> colossal head was discovered in 1970 and was the fifteenth to be recorded . It was discovered in a mountain pass in the Sierra de los <unk> , on the north side of El <unk> volcano near to Santiago <unk> . The head was largely buried when found ; excavations uncovered a Late Classic ( 600 – 900 AD ) offering associated with the head consisting of a ceramic vessel and a 12 @-@ <unk> ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) long <unk> knife placed pointing northwards towards the head . The offering is believed to have been deposited long after the head was sculpted . The La <unk> head has been moved from its original location to the main plaza at Santiago . 
 The La <unk> head is more or less rounded and measures 3 by 3 metres ( 9 @.@ 8 by 9 @.@ 8 ft ) by 3 @.@ 4 metres ( 11 ft ) high , making it the largest known head . This massive sculpture is estimated to weigh 40 tons . It is <unk> distinct from the other examples , and <unk> de la <unk> placed it late in the <unk> time frame . The characteristics of the sculpture have led to some investigators suggesting that it represents a deceased person . Norman Hammond argues that the apparent stylistic differences of the monument stem from its unfinished state rather than its late production . The eyes of the monument are closed , the nose is flattened and lacks nostrils and the mouth was not sculpted in a realistic manner . The headdress is in the form of a plain horizontal band . 
 The original location of the La <unk> head was not a major archaeological site and it is likely that the head was either abandoned at its source or during transport to its intended destination . Various features of the head suggest that it was unfinished , such as a lack of symmetry below the mouth and an area of rough stone above the base . Rock was not removed from around the <unk> as on other heads , and does not narrow towards the base . Large parts of the monument seem to be <unk> out without finished detail . The right hand <unk> also appears incomplete ; the forward portion is marked with a sculpted line while the rear portion has been sculpted in relief , probably indicating that the right cheek and eye area were also unfinished . The La <unk> head was almost certainly carved from a raw <unk> rather than being sculpted from a throne . 
 <unk> <unk> Monument 23 dates to the Middle <unk> period , and is found in <unk> <unk> , an important city in the foothills of the <unk> Pacific coast , in the modern department of <unk> . It appears to be an <unk> @-@ style colossal head re @-@ carved into a niche figure sculpture . If originally a colossal head then it would be the only known example from outside the <unk> <unk> . 
 Monument 23 is sculpted from <unk> and falls in the middle of the size range for confirmed colossal heads . It stands 1 @.@ 84 metres ( 6 @.@ 0 ft ) high and measures 1 @.@ 2 metres ( 3 @.@ 9 ft ) wide by 1 @.@ 56 metres ( 5 @.@ 1 ft ) deep . Like the examples from the <unk> <unk> , the monument features a flat back . Lee Parsons contests John Graham 's identification of Monument 23 as a re @-@ carved colossal head ; he views the side ornaments , identified by Graham as ears , as rather the <unk> eyes of an open @-@ <unk> monster <unk> upwards . <unk> this , James Porter has claimed that the re @-@ carving of the face of a colossal head into a niche figure is clearly evident . 
 Monument 23 was damaged in the mid @-@ twentieth century by a local <unk> who attempted to break its exposed upper portion using a steel <unk> . As a result , the top is fragmented , although the broken pieces were recovered by archaeologists and have been put back into place . 
 Several colossal heads have been loaned to temporary exhibitions abroad ; San Lorenzo <unk> Head 6 was loaned to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 1970 . San Lorenzo colossal heads 4 and 8 were lent to the <unk> Art of Ancient Mexico exhibition in the National Gallery of Art , Washington , D.C. that ran from 30 June to 20 October 1996 . San Lorenzo Head 4 was again loaned in 2005 , this time to the de Young Museum in San Francisco . The de Young Museum was loaned San Lorenzo colossal heads 5 and 9 for its <unk> : <unk> <unk> of Ancient Mexico exhibition , which ran from 19 February to 8 May 2011 . 
 On 12 January 2009 , at least three people , including two <unk> and one American , entered the <unk> @-@ <unk> La <unk> in <unk> and damaged just under 30 archaeological pieces , including the four La <unk> colossal heads . The <unk> were all members of an evangelical church and appeared to have been carrying out a supposed pre @-@ Columbian ritual , during which salts , grape juice and oil were thrown on the heads . It was estimated that 300 @,@ 000 pesos ( US $ 21 @,@ 900 ) would be needed to repair the damage , and the restoration process would last four months . The three <unk> were released soon after their arrest after paying 330 @,@ 000 pesos each . 
 Although not all of the replicas were placed by him , the majority of replicas around the world were placed under the leadership of Miguel <unk> <unk> , former governor of the state of Veracruz . The following is a list of replicas and their locations within the United States : 
 Austin , Texas . A replica of San Lorenzo Head 1 was placed in the Teresa <unk> Long Institute of Latin American Studies at the University of Texas in November 2008 . 
 Chicago , Illinois . A replica of San Lorenzo Head 8 made by <unk> <unk> <unk> was placed in the Field Museum of Natural History in 2000 . 
 <unk> , California . A replica of San Lorenzo Head 5 was donated to <unk> in 1989 , originally intended to be placed in <unk> Park . Due to concerns over potential <unk> it was instead installed outside the police station . It was removed in 2011 and relocated to <unk> 's Glen , <unk> Park in June 2012 . 
 <unk> , Texas . A replica of San Lorenzo Head 8 is located in the International Museum of Art & Science . The specific date placement is unknown , but it was dedicated by <unk> Herrera <unk> , then governor of Veracruz , during his time in office between 2004 – 2010 . 
 New York . A replica of San Lorenzo Head 1 was placed next to the main plaza in the grounds of <unk> College in the Bronx , New York . It was installed in 2013 to celebrate the first anniversary of the <unk> Institute of Mexican Studies , housed at the college . The replica was a gift by the government of <unk> state , <unk> <unk> and Mexico Trade ; it was first <unk> in <unk> <unk> Park , outside the United Nations , in 2012 .

 Stevens is known for a calm , focused coaching style . He spends a lot of time <unk> opponents using statistical analysis , adding new <unk> to his team 's play each game . He puts a strong emphasis on defensive and team oriented basketball . Butler 's success against teams with superior athletes has been attributed to Stevens ' coaching style and calm demeanor . Stevens has twice been named the Horizon League Coach of the Year and won <unk> 's Hugh Durham Award mid @-@ season honors in January 2009 .

 Bradley Kent Stevens grew up in <unk> , Indiana , where he developed his love for basketball . Starting at age five , Stevens would watch taped basketball games " before he went to afternoon kindergarten " . His father would often drive him to <unk> , to watch Indiana <unk> games . " It 's hard not to be [ in love with basketball ] when you 're a kid growing up in Indiana " , Stevens later said . 
 For his eighth birthday , Stevens received a new basketball <unk> . " It ’ s so much fun to dream in your <unk> , " he later remarked . " That ’ s where my friends and I hung out . It was a lot of fun to grow up in that era . " When a friend , Brandon <unk> , had a basketball court installed in his back yard , Stevens " appeared <unk> . " He was so dedicated to the game that he would bring the unprepared ingredients for <unk> cheese sandwiches over to <unk> 's house , so that he would not waste time waiting for the sandwiches to cook . 
 <unk> 's court soon became a gathering place , where <unk> kids and kids from the surrounding areas would hold <unk> games . These games helped develop Stevens ' competitive streak . Besides playing basketball , the young Stevens also enjoyed solving puzzles , a skill he later applied to <unk> opposing teams to find their weaknesses . 
 Stevens attended <unk> Community High School , where he became a star basketball player . He wore No. 31 in high school in honor of Indiana <unk> guard <unk> Miller . During his freshman year , he would get up early to practice shooting at a local gym before school . The hard work paid off as Stevens made the varsity team that same year . By the time his high school career was complete , Stevens had set school records for career scoring , assists , steals , and three @-@ point field goals . As of 2010 , he still holds the records for points ( <unk> ) , assists ( <unk> ) , and steals ( 156 ) , as well as the single @-@ season points record ( <unk> in 1995 ) . Stevens was named to the all @-@ conference team three times . In 1995 , he was named the <unk> MVP and was the leading scorer in state <unk> play ( 32 @.@ 3 ppg ) . 
 Stevens made the academic all @-@ state first team and received the <unk> A Gold Medal Award all four years . He was a member of the National Honor Society , graduating seventh in his class of 165 . He earned three letters in basketball , three in track , and one in baseball during his days at <unk> . During summers , he traveled the country playing <unk> basketball . 
 Although Stevens had a strong passion for the game , he realized that his basketball skills were modest and not likely to get him very far . As such , he chose to attend <unk> oriented <unk> University for college . During his stay , he played in all 101 <unk> games , earning four varsity letters . He earned multiple all @-@ conference and academic all @-@ conference awards , and was a three @-@ time Academic All @-@ America nominee . He was a team captain his senior year , and averaged more than 8 points per game three of his four years . His career highs were 24 points and 8 rebounds in a game . After his senior year , Stevens received the Coaches ’ Award . Coach Bill <unk> later described Stevens as " one of the most <unk> , team @-@ oriented person [ sic ] I 've ever been around . " 
 While at <unk> , Stevens was a member of the Management <unk> Honors Program and the <unk> Community Services ’ Sports Night executive board . He was also a brother of the Alpha <unk> <unk> <unk> . During summer vacations , Stevens spent time teaching at Butler basketball camps . He was named to the Dean 's list and graduated in 1999 with a degree in economics . 
 In the summer of 2000 , Stevens was offered the opportunity to volunteer in the Butler basketball office . He ran the idea of quitting his job at <unk> Lilly by then @-@ longtime girlfriend Tracy <unk> . She thought about it for two hours before telling him to go for it . " Now , it looks like a great idea , " Stevens later remarked . " At the time , I thought it was something I really wanted to try . " Tracy went back to school to get a law degree that could support the couple if things did not work out for Brad . " We were 23 and realized this was our chance , " Tracy later said . " Five years down the road , we were probably not going to be in a position to do that . The more success you had at Lilly , the harder it would be to leave . " 
 Stevens planned to live in a friend 's basement and took a job at <unk> ’ s to pay the bills . Before he started training at <unk> 's , he was offered a low @-@ paying administrative position as coordinator of basketball operations under then @-@ coach <unk> <unk> . The position had opened up when assistant coach Jamal <unk> resigned after being arrested on <unk> and drug charges , of which he was later acquitted . Years later , <unk> recalled , " [ Stevens ] was just a hungry young kid that was desperate to get into coaching . He had a great passion and was willing to take a risk to get into the coaching profession . " 
 After <unk> left the school following the 2000 – 01 season , new head coach Todd <unk> promoted Stevens to a full @-@ time assistant coach . Under <unk> , Stevens was active in every aspect of the game : skills instruction , game preparation , in @-@ game coaching , and recruiting . Butler was 131 – 61 during Stevens ' time as an assistant coach . 
 On April 2 , 2007 , <unk> resigned in order to take the head @-@ coaching position at the University of Iowa . The Butler players had a meeting with athletic director Barry <unk> , urging him to promote from within . <unk> , having spent the entire season observing the assistant coaches ' interaction with the team , agreed . The day after <unk> resigned Stevens and Butler 's two other assistant coaches interviewed for the job . Within 24 hours of the interviews Stevens was named Butler 's new head coach . According to <unk> , Stevens had something older , outside candidates could never match : six years of experience learning the Butler system , dubbed " The Butler Way " by <unk> . " Age wasn 't a factor because I 'd seen his ability shine through during the course of the season , " <unk> said . 
 At the start of the 2007 – 08 season , Stevens was the second youngest coach in Division I basketball . He got off to a fast start , winning his first eight games before falling to Wright State 43 – 42 . <unk> coach Bob Knight , whose Texas Tech team was an early victim , said " I wish we played as smart as they do . " Virginia Tech coach Seth Greenberg added " they 've got <unk> about them and they expect to win . " 
 Midway through Stevens ' first season , with the Bulldogs at 12 – 1 , The New York Times wrote " so far , Stevens has made the transition [ to head coach ] look easy . " The Times went on to state that Stevens had the calm and <unk> of a <unk> veteran . " You ’ ve got a lot of people always looking for the next step . And that ’ s not what I was doing . I was just trying to figure out a way to win the next game and think like a head coach . " Stevens said . 
 Butler ended the regular season with a 27 – 3 record , taking first place in the Horizon League with a 16 – 2 in conference mark . The team beat Illinois @-@ Chicago 66 – 50 and Cleveland State 70 – 55 to claim the league 's tournament title and an automatic bid to the 2008 NCAA tournament . Butler was awarded the seven seed in the East Regional . They beat tenth @-@ <unk> South Alabama 81 – 61 in the first round , before falling to second @-@ <unk> Tennessee 76 – 71 in overtime . 
 Stevens ended up with a school and Horizon league record 30 wins , beating several big name schools – Michigan , Texas Tech , Florida State , Ohio State – along the way . In so doing , he became the third @-@ youngest head coach in NCAA Division I history to lead a team to 30 wins in a season , and became the fourth @-@ <unk> first @-@ year coach . Butler was nationally ranked for a school and league record 19 consecutive weeks . Butler 's 30 – 4 record was the best among teams that did not reach the Final Four . Stevens was a <unk> for the Hugh Durham Award , losing to <unk> Davis of Drake , and a <unk> for the Jim <unk> National Coach of the Year Award , losing to Bo Ryan . 
 At the conclusion of the season , Butler signed Stevens to a seven @-@ year contract . " We are extremely excited to reach this long @-@ term agreement to have Brad continue to lead our program , " <unk> remarked . 
 Butler lost four starters after the 2007 – 08 season , and was picked to finish fifth in the Horizon league during the 2008 – 09 season . The team got off to a 12 – 1 start that won Stevens the Hugh Durham mid @-@ season coaching award . On February 5 , Stevens notched his 50th win as Butler beat Detroit 66 – 61 . In so doing , Stevens became the sixth head coach in NCAA history to reach 50 wins in 56 games or fewer . Butler finished first in the Horizon League with a 15 – 3 in conference record , <unk> preseason expectations . Butler lost the Horizon League tournament final 57 – 54 to Cleveland State , but made the NCAA tournament as an at @-@ large selection . The team received the nine seed in the South Regional , and lost to eighth @-@ <unk> Louisiana State in the first round by a score of 75 – 71 to finish the year at 26 – 6 overall . 
 Stevens ' 56 – 10 two @-@ year record places him second only to Bill <unk> ( 58 ) in total wins during one 's first two years as head coach . Stevens was a <unk> for both the Hugh Durham and Jim <unk> Awards for the second straight year and was named the Horizon League Coach of the Year . He was also named as a <unk> for the Henry <unk> Coach of the Year Award . Stevens was given a one @-@ year contract extension at the conclusion of the season . 
 <unk> in large part by Gordon <unk> 's and <unk> Mack 's roles in leading Team USA to the gold medal in the FIBA Under @-@ 19 World Championship during the off @-@ season , Butler began the season ranked 10th in the Coaches ' Poll and 11th in the AP Poll . A few commentators picked the Bulldogs as a possible " <unk> team " to make the Final Four . Stevens was not so sure , privately telling his father , " We have a really good team , and I ’ m not sure how far we can go this year , but next year , we ought to go really far . " 
 Butler got off to a mediocre start , losing twice in the 76 Classic 82 – 73 to 22nd @-@ ranked Minnesota and to 19th @-@ ranked Clemson 70 – 69 . After the tournament Butler 's record stood at 4 – 2 and the team dropped to # 23 in the AP Poll and # 20 in the Coaches ' Poll . Butler won its next two games before falling to 13th @-@ ranked Georgetown 72 – 65 in the Jimmy V Classic . The team won its next two games beating # 15 Ohio State 74 – 66 and edging out former conference rival Xavier 69 – 68 , both at home . After losing 67 – 57 at <unk> three days later , Butler stood at 9 – 4 and fell out of the AP rankings . However , the team remained in the Coaches Poll at # 23 . 
 Stevens rallied the team , and they proceeded to win 16 straight games before facing <unk> in a <unk> game . Butler beat <unk> 70 – 53 and Stevens tied the NCAA record for most wins ( 81 ) by a head coach in his first three seasons set by Mark Few of <unk> in 2002 and tied by Mark Fox of Nevada in 2007 . 
 On February 26 , 2010 , Butler traveled to <unk> for their regular season finale . Leading scorer Gordon <unk> was sidelined with lower back pain , but the team still won 74 – 69 . In so doing , Stevens broke the coaching record he had tied the prior week and Butler completed an 18 – 0 undefeated conference schedule . It was Butler 's first undefeated conference record since joining the Horizon League , and first since Joe <unk> led the 1978 team to a 6 – 0 record in the now defunct Indiana Collegiate Conference . Stevens earned his third straight regular @-@ season conference championship . 
 In the Horizon league tournament , Stevens ' Bulldogs used their home @-@ court advantage to beat Milwaukee 68 – 59 in the semi @-@ finals and to beat Wright State 70 – 45 in the finals . The win earned the team an automatic bid into the 2010 NCAA tournament , and completed a 20 – 0 run through league play . Stevens became the first coach to lead a Horizon League team to both an undefeated regular season and conference tournament since the league was formed in 1979 . Stevens was also the only coach in Division I to lead his team to an undefeated conference schedule during the 2009 – 10 season . 
 For their season , the Bulldogs were ranked 8th in the final pre @-@ NCAA tournament Coaches ' Poll and 11th in the corresponding AP Poll . On Selection Sunday , the Bulldogs were <unk> fifth in the West regional of the NCAA tournament and given a first @-@ round match up with twelfth <unk> <unk> on March 18 . 
 Many basketball commentators picked <unk> to pull the upset , and at halftime it looked like they might be right , as <unk> led 33 – 27 . Stevens made a number of halftime adjustments , and the Bulldogs came out firing on all cylinders in the second half . The team dominated the second half and won the game 77 – 59 . Butler next faced off with thirteenth <unk> Murray State . The game was close throughout , but Butler emerged victorious 54 – 52 when <unk> <unk> a Murray State pass into the back court with less than five seconds on the clock . The win gave Stevens the first Sweet Sixteen appearance of his career . 
 On March 25 , 2010 , Butler faced top @-@ <unk> Syracuse . The Bulldogs got off to a good start , jumping out to a 12 – 1 lead and a 35 – 25 halftime advantage . Syracuse rallied in the second half , taking its first lead of the game , 40 – 39 , off a Wes Johnson three @-@ pointer . Stevens called timeout and Butler regained the lead on its next possession , stopping the run . At the 5 : 32 mark , Syracuse got a rare fast break opportunity that ended with a dunk and 54 – 50 lead . Stevens again called time out and re @-@ focused the team . Butler responded by holding Syracuse scoreless for the next 5 minutes , taking a 60 – 54 lead with 0 : 59 to go . Butler held on to win 63 – 59 , advancing to the <unk> Eight for the first time in school history . 
 Two days later , Stevens ' Bulldogs met second @-@ <unk> Kansas State in the regional finals . Perhaps feeling the effects of their double overtime 101 – 96 win two days prior , Kansas State got off to a slow start , scoring just 20 points in the first half to trail 27 – 20 . Butler kept the lead in the upper single digits for most of the second half , before Kansas State went on a 13 – 2 run and took a 52 – 51 lead . Stevens immediately called time out and re @-@ focused the team . " Play your game . Just play your game , " he told them . On the ensuing possession , Butler regained the lead for good . They <unk> Kansas State 12 – 4 the rest of the way and won the game 63 – 56 . In the post game celebration , Stevens and walk @-@ on forward Emerson <unk> connected on a flying back @-@ bump that became one of the iconic images of the tournament . 
 The win earned the Bulldogs a trip back to Indianapolis for the first Final Four appearance in school and Horizon League history . The win made Stevens , at age 33 , the youngest coach to lead a team to the Final Four since Bob Knight made his first Final Four appearance at age 32 in 1973 . Butler became the smallest school ( enrollment 4 @,@ 200 ) to make the Final Four since <unk> began in 1979 . 
 On April 3 , Brad Stevens and the Butler Bulldogs faced off with Michigan State in the national semi @-@ finals . Michigan State took an early 14 – 7 lead , and Matt Howard got in early foul trouble , sitting most the first half . Stevens kept the team focused with a " next man up " attitude and the game was tied at 28 at halftime . The second half was dominated by tight defense for both sides . With 2 : 45 to go in the game , the score was 47 – 44 Butler . Michigan State called a time out to set up a play . Stevens correctly anticipated the play call and had Ronald <unk> , the team 's best defender , switch onto <unk> <unk> off a screen . <unk> stole the ball and Shawn <unk> got fouled on the resulting run out , hitting 1 of 2 . <unk> 50 – 49 with under 30 seconds remaining , Michigan State came up empty and was forced to foul . <unk> hit both foul shots , giving Butler a 52 – 49 lead . After a Michigan State time out , Stevens had his team foul <unk> with 2 seconds remaining to prevent a potentially game tying 3 @-@ pointer . After making the first , <unk> intentionally missed the second free throw . <unk> came down with the rebound to seal the victory . Butler became the first team since the shot clock was adopted for the 1985 – 86 season to hold five straight tournament opponents under 60 points . 
 On April 5 , 2010 , Butler and Duke faced off in what The New York Times called " the most eagerly awaited championship game in years " . Late in the first half , Duke went on an 8 – 0 run to take a 26 – 20 lead . Stevens called a timeout . With starters Matt Howard and Ronald <unk> on the bench in foul trouble , Stevens was forced to call on backup center Avery <unk> who came up big for Butler . <unk> scored 10 first half points , tying his season high . At half time , Duke 's lead stood at 33 – 32 . 
 The second half was played very closely , with neither team taking a substantial lead . With 3 : 16 to play , Duke took a 60 – 55 lead on two made free throws by Nolan Smith . Butler cut the lead to one point in the final minute and , after a missed Kyle <unk> jump shot with 36 seconds remaining , got a chance to retake the lead . Butler was unable to initiate their offense and Stevens called a timeout to set up a play . A failed <unk> attempt and a timeout later , <unk> missed a baseline fade @-@ away <unk> and Brian <unk> came down with the rebound for Duke . He was quickly fouled with less than 4 seconds remaining . <unk> narrowly missed a <unk> half @-@ court shot court as time expired , making the final margin 61 – 59 . 
 The loss snapped Butler 's 25 @-@ game winning streak , the longest in school history . Butler became the smallest school to play for a National Championship since Jacksonville in 1970 . Stevens became the second @-@ youngest head coach to coach in the NCAA National Championship Game , behind Branch <unk> who led the Indiana <unk> to the 1940 National Championship at age 31 . Stevens was named as both a Hugh Durham and Jim <unk> Award <unk> for the third consecutive year , losing to Mike Young and Jamie Dixon respectively . He was also a <unk> for the <unk> Prosser Man of the Year Award , which was won by Bob <unk> . 
 Butler finished the year ranked # 2 in the Coaches ' Poll , the highest ranking in school history . The school was ranked for 19 consecutive weeks , tying the school record . 
 After the end of the 2009 – 10 season , Brad Stevens and Butler continued to attract considerable attention . President Barack Obama personally called Stevens to <unk> him on Butler 's season . David Letterman had Stevens on his show for a guest appearance . Butler admissions inquiries shot up 67 % . Stevens received fan letters from around the world , and his phone rang off the hook . He was invited to throw the ceremonial first pitch before the Chicago Cubs vs. Florida Marlins game in Chicago on May 10 . " It 's all been very surreal , " Stevens said . " If you are the runner @-@ up , you don 't expect to talk to the president . " " It 's been a little overwhelming , because I 'm a pretty simple guy , " he added . 
 The 2009 – 10 season also helped increase Butler 's recruiting profile . Asked if the increased fame would change things , Stevens said it better not <unk> him or the university . " I look at this new challenge of not changing and sticking to your core values and making sure you remain humble as a great coaching opportunity . " 
 Rankings by ESPN 's Andy Katz and Fox Sports ' Jeff Goodman released shortly after the 2010 Championship game both had Butler third for the 2010 – 2011 season . Duke coach Mike <unk> agreed , saying Butler would be " right up there , No. 1 or No. 2 ... They 'll be a favorite next year . " However , <unk> chose to leave early for the NBA Draft and Butler went through a rough patch early in the season , at one point losing three straight games and having a 6 – 5 conference record . <unk> by the emergence of Andrew Smith at center and Matt Howard 's success as a perimeter forward , Butler ended up winning a share of the conference title at 13 – 5 . The Bulldogs then won the Horizon League Tournament to secure an automatic NCAA tournament bid , and received an 8 seed . 
 <unk> by many to lose a first @-@ round match @-@ up against Old Dominion , Butler advanced on a last @-@ second tip @-@ in by Howard . Howard was also clutch in their next game , hitting a free throw with a less than one second remaining to beat Pitt in a dramatic finish . <unk> Mack scored 30 points in the win . Butler won their next game when they defeated Wisconsin . On March 26 , 2011 , the Bulldogs beat Florida 74 – 71 in overtime to earn back @-@ to @-@ back trips to the Final Four . On April 2 , Butler beat fellow Cinderella team <unk> 70 – 62 to make it to a second consecutive national championship game . For the second consecutive year , the Bulldogs fell in the national championship game , this time to Connecticut . 
 On April 8 , 2010 , Stevens signed a long @-@ term deal with Butler , extending his contract through the <unk> – 22 season . Financial terms of the contract were not disclosed ; however , Butler president Bobby <unk> had publicly stated that the university could afford to increase Stevens ' base salary to approximately US $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 a few days prior . Stevens had previously made US $ 395 @,@ 000 plus benefits in base salary , a relatively low figure for a successful Division I head basketball coach . His total compensation for 2009 – 10 was estimated at US $ 750 @,@ 000 . Stevens had received a raise after each of his three seasons at Butler and his contract contains a buyout clause estimated in the high six or low seven figures . 
 By re @-@ signing with Butler , Stevens temporarily ended speculation that he would leave the university for a higher paying job . Oregon , Clemson , and Wake Forest were all said to be interested in offering Stevens multi @-@ million dollar contracts to leave Butler . " First and foremost , I ’ m loyal to Butler , " Stevens said . When asked if he would ever leave Butler , Stevens replied " I guess if they kicked me out . " 
 After the 2011 – 12 season , Stevens was pursued vigorously by Illinois to fill their coaching vacancy before he declined their offer . 
 In March 2013 , UCLA reportedly offered Stevens between $ 2 @.@ 5 and $ 3 million a year to leave Butler . <unk> circulated that Stevens was in contract negotiations with UCLA , but ultimately the rumors proved false and Stevens stayed at Butler . Commenting on the situation , a source close to Stevens said " Brad doesn 't understand why people would assume he 's leaving . " A few days later , Stevens reiterated that he was very happy at Butler and had no intentions to leave as long as he had the support of the university to continue running the program the " right way " . 
 On July 3 , 2013 , Stevens was signed as the head coach by the Boston Celtics . Reports state that his new contract is a six @-@ year , $ 22 million deal . In April 2015 , Stevens led the Celtics to the NBA <unk> as the 7th seed in the Eastern Conference with a 40 – 42 record . On April 21 , 2015 , it was announced that Stevens finished fourth in voting for the NBA 's Coach of the Year Award . On March 1 , 2016 , Stevens was named the Eastern Conference Coach of the Month for games played during February . In April 2016 , Brad Stevens led the Celtics to their second consecutive playoff appearance under his tenure as the 5th seed in the 2016 NBA <unk> finishing the season with a 48 – 34 record . On June 1 , 2016 , Stevens received a contract extension . 
 According to Stevens , in one of his first games as head coach , he was nervous and " felt like our team played on edge " because of it . He decided that a team 's play will reflect the mood of its coach ; a calm coach means a team that will remain poised in difficult game situations , while a nervous coach means a team that plays on edge . " I don ’ t want to lose a game because of my approach , " he told himself . Accordingly , he developed a strategy of always remaining calm and focused during games . He rarely raises his voice or gets emotional , instead quietly observing on the <unk> with folded arms . He does not get upset about bad calls by <unk> or player mistakes , preferring to focus on " the next play " rather than what just happened . Butler player Willie <unk> explained Butler 's 2010 Final Four run by saying , " When those big runs [ by Syracuse and Kansas State ] came , Coach called a timeout and said a few calm words . Then he said he believes in us , he loves us and we 're going to win the game . " On the rare occasion Stevens feels the need to correct a player , he does it with " positive reinforcement , just at a little louder <unk> " , according to former assistant coach Matthew Graves . Above all , Stevens wants his players to be confident , not living in fear of being <unk> for making a bad play . 
 <unk> , Stevens is always calm , but internally he is far from it . " I 'm not as calm as everybody thinks , " Stevens says . His wife Tracy adds , " He ’ s calm and collected , but he ’ s fiercely competitive . He ’ s always thinking about how he can beat you . " Former player Joel <unk> says " Everyone sees Brad as a level @-@ headed , calm and cool coach , but he ’ s about as competitive of a guy as I know . We would get into it constantly , whether playing two @-@ on @-@ two or arguing about players ’ having better college careers . " 
 Stevens spends a lot of time preparing for each game , and always tries to add a few new <unk> specific to that game 's opponent . Sports Illustrated calls Stevens an expert " on breaking down tape and looking at statistical trends to find opponents ' weaknesses . " Former player Ronald <unk> agrees : " We know everything we need to about our opponents , all their tendencies are broken down " ahead of time . 
 Stevens is a proponent of using statistical analysis to enhance his coaching decisions , spending almost as much time looking at statistics as watching game film . " I think it 's a unique way of looking at the game that may be able to help best communicate to your players " , he explains . For example , when Butler was <unk> in late 2010 , Stevens challenged his team : " this [ 46 % defensive field goal percentage ] is where we are . This isn 't acceptable to get to where we want to go . But what does that really mean ? It 's not just get better <unk> , it is , if we give up 3 less <unk> a game , then we will be at 40 percent field goal percentage defense which will be top 20 in the country " . The team got the message , improved throughout the season , and ultimately went on a March run fueled by defense . In 2012 , Stevens became the first college coach to hire someone solely for statistical research when he added Drew Cannon to the staff . If he had the resources , Stevens says he would hire a team of <unk> to analyze the teams play . 
 Stevens ' teams are built around solid basketball <unk> and good team work , rather than individual basketball skill . His teams are known for their defense , forcing opponents into <unk> mistakes . The secret to basketball – and life – is " just to do the job to the best of your ability and don 't worry about anything else , " Stevens says . " <unk> the next game . <unk> the next possession . That 's our focus . It 's boring . It 's also the way championships are won " , he says . In short , Stevens is a strong believer in " The Butler Way " – doing all the little things that transform a group of good basketball players into a great basketball team . " I tell the players ' the Butler Way ' isn 't easy to define , " Stevens says , " but you can see it on the floor when we share the basketball , play with great energy and defend . " 
 Stevens prefers to recruit strong team players instead of going after " top recruits . " " The guys we [ have ] recruited , most of them weren 't very highly ranked , " Stevens says . " They had very good high school careers or careers at other places ( transfers ) , but for one reason or the other they weren 't seen as great players . But they all had <unk> . " Stevens puts a strong emphasis on education and has said he would only recruit a " one and done " player if he was committed to getting his degree while playing professionally . 
 Stevens has often been referred to as a coaching <unk> , but is not interested in self @-@ promotion . He instead prefers to <unk> the praise he receives to the players , athletic department , and his <unk> . He has not been known to posture for more money , or to leak his name for open coaching positions . He has been described as humble , modest , and not " about the money " . 
 The New York Times , USA Today , ESPN , and other commentators have attributed Butler 's success against teams with superior athletes to Stevens ' coaching style . The Times remarks , " the Bulldogs are very well prepared for their opponents , and they do not <unk> easily " , and says that the resulting confidence has led to the team 's success . " He coaches to his personality and to his strengths , " <unk> says . " <unk> , he has great <unk> and communication ability with his team . " Yahoo ! Sports compared Stevens to legendary coach John Wooden writing " Brad Stevens is winning at Butler the Wooden way – calm and composed on the <unk> . " Wooden agreed , saying , " I enjoy watching [ Stevens ] and very much enjoy [ Butler 's ] style of play . " 
 Brad Stevens is known for his youthful looks , often being described as " baby @-@ faced " . One commentator remarked , " Stevens looks like he checks the mirror every morning to see if it 's time to start <unk> . " On occasion , he has been mistaken for a player . He is also known for projecting a professional , " corporate " look from the sidelines . Asked what his life would be like if he had never taken up coaching , he replies " If everything else remained the same , I would have been as happy as <unk> ... Friends and family and faith , they 're going to take the cake over all this stuff . " Stevens met his wife , Tracy ( née <unk> ) , while attending <unk> University . Tracy , who played soccer for <unk> , quickly learned of Brad 's love for basketball ; on their third date he drove her an hour and a half to attend a high school basketball game . Tracy graduated from Rocky River High School in 1995 , and from <unk> in 1999 . She returned to school in 2000 , driving five hours from Case Western 's law school to Indianapolis on weekends to see Brad . She finished her final year of law school in Indianapolis , and the couple married in August 2003 . Tracy works as a labor and employment lawyer . Tracy also serves as Brad 's agent . 
 Brad and Tracy Stevens are involved with the American Cancer Society 's Coaches <unk> . Cancer . Brad says that the cause really hit home for them after Tracy 's mother died of the disease in June 2004 . The day before Butler 's 2010 Final Four appearance , they hosted a fundraiser for the organization . Brad Stevens has also volunteered his time to the <unk> Foundation for Kids , a charity <unk> <unk> children run by former Butler player Avery <unk> . Stevens remains in close touch with the Butler basketball family ; he notably took a one @-@ game leave from the Celtics in January 2016 to visit with Andrew Smith , a player on both of Butler 's Final Four teams who was dying of cancer ; Smith died less than a week later . At the request of Andrew 's widow , Sam , Brad delivered the <unk> at the memorial service on January 17 , 2016 . 
 Stevens ' father , Mark , is an <unk> surgeon in Indianapolis and former Indiana <unk> football player . His mother , Jan , is a university professor . She has previously taught at Butler . 
 <unk> is an impact crater that lies at the south pole of the Moon . The peaks along the crater 's rim are exposed to almost continual sunlight , while the interior is <unk> in shadow ( a <unk> of eternal darkness ) . The low @-@ temperature interior of this crater functions as a cold trap that may capture and freeze <unk> shed during comet impacts on the Moon . Measurements by the <unk> <unk> spacecraft showed higher than normal amounts of hydrogen within the crater , which may indicate the presence of water ice . The crater is named after Antarctic explorer Ernest <unk> . 
 The rotational axis of the Moon lies within <unk> , only a few kilometers from its center . The crater is 21 km in diameter and 4 @.@ 2 km deep . From the Earth , it is viewed edge @-@ on in a region of rough , <unk> terrain . It is located within the South Pole @-@ <unk> basin on a <unk> . The rim is slightly raised about the surrounding surface and it has an outer rampart that has been only lightly impacted . No significant craters intersect the rim , and it is sloped about 1 @.@ 5 ° toward the direction 50 – 90 ° from the Earth . The age of the crater is about 3 @.@ 6 billion years and it has been in the proximity of the south lunar pole for at least the last two billion years . 
 Because the orbit of the Moon is <unk> only 5 ° from the ecliptic , the interior of this crater lies in perpetual darkness . Estimates of the area in permanent shadow were obtained from Earth @-@ based radar studies . <unk> along the rim of the crater are almost continually illuminated by sunlight , spending about 80 – 90 % of each lunar orbit exposed to the Sun . <unk> illuminated mountains have been termed peaks of eternal light and have been predicted to exist since the 1900s . 
 The shadowed portion of the crater was <unk> with the <unk> Camera of the Japanese <unk> spacecraft using the illumination of sunlight reflected off the rim . The interior of the crater consists of a symmetrical 30 ° slope that leads down to a 6 @.@ 6 km diameter floor . The handful of craters along the interior span no more than a few hundred meters . The bottom is covered by an uneven mound @-@ like feature that is 300 to 400 m thick . The central peak is about 200 m in height . 
 The continuous shadows in the south polar craters cause the floors of these formations to maintain a temperature that never exceeds about 100 K. For <unk> , the average temperature was determined to be about 90 K , reaching 88 K at the crater floor . Under these conditions , the estimated rate of loss from any ice in the interior would be 10 − 26 to 10 − 27 m / s . Any water vapor that arrives here following a <unk> impact on the Moon would lie permanently frozen on or below the surface . However , the surface albedo of the crater floor matches the lunar far @-@ side , suggesting that there is no exposed surface ice . 
 This crater was named after Ernest Henry <unk> , an Anglo @-@ Irish explorer of Antarctica from 1901 until his death in 1922 . The name was officially adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1994 . Nearby craters of note include Shoemaker , <unk> , de <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . <unk> farther away , on the eastern hemisphere of the lunar near side , are the larger craters <unk> and Scott , named after two other early explorers of the Antarctic continent . 
 From the perspective of the Earth , this crater lies along the southern limb of the Moon , making observation difficult . Detailed mapping of the polar regions and <unk> of the Moon did not occur until the advent of orbiting spacecraft . <unk> lies entirely within the rim of the immense South Pole @-@ <unk> basin , which is one of the largest known impact formations in the Solar System . This basin is over 12 kilometers deep , and an exploration of its properties could provide useful information about the lunar interior . 
 A neutron <unk> on board the <unk> <unk> spacecraft detected enhanced concentrations of hydrogen close to the northern and southern lunar poles , including the crater <unk> . At the end of this mission in July 1999 , the spacecraft was crashed into the nearby crater Shoemaker in the hope of detecting from Earth @-@ based telescopes an impact @-@ generated plume containing water vapor . The impact event did not produce any detectable water vapor , and this may be an indication that the hydrogen is not in the form of hydrated minerals , or that the impact site did not contain any ice . Alternatively , it is possible that the crash did not excavate deeply enough into the <unk> to liberate significant quantities of water vapor . 
 From Earth @-@ based radar and spacecraft images of the crater edge , <unk> appears to be relatively intact ; much like a young crater that has not been significantly eroded from subsequent impacts . This may mean that the inner sides are relatively steep , which may make traversing the sides relatively difficult for a robotic vehicle . In addition , it is possible that the interior floor might not have collected a significant quantity of <unk> since its formation . However other craters in the vicinity are considerably older , and may contain significant deposits of hydrogen , possibly in the form of water ice . ( See Shoemaker ( lunar crater ) , for example . ) 
 Radar studies preceding and following the <unk> <unk> mission demonstrate that the inner walls of <unk> are similar in reflective characteristics to those of some <unk> craters . In particular , the surroundings appear to contain a significant number of blocks in its <unk> blanket , suggesting that its radar properties are a result of surface <unk> , and not ice deposits , as was previously suggested from a radar experiment involving the <unk> mission . This interpretation , however , is not universally agreed upon within the scientific community . Radar images of the crater at a wavelength of 13 cm show no evidence for water ice deposits . 
 Optical imaging inside the crater was done for the first time by the Japanese lunar <unk> spacecraft <unk> in 2007 . It did not have any evidence of significant amount of water ice , down to the image resolution of 10 m per pixel . 
 On November 15 , 2008 , a 34 @-@ kg probe made a hard landing near the crater . The moon impact probe ( <unk> ) was launched from the Indian <unk> @-@ I spacecraft and reached the surface 25 minutes later . The probe carried a radar <unk> , video imaging system , and a mass <unk> , which will be used to search for water . 
 Some sites along <unk> 's rim receive almost constant illumination . At these <unk> sunlight is almost always available for conversion into electricity using solar panels , potentially making them good locations for future Moon landings . The temperature at this site is also more favorable than at more equatorial latitudes as it does not experience the daily temperature extremes of 100 ° C when the Sun is overhead , to as low as − 150 ° C during the lunar night . 
 While scientific experiments performed by <unk> and <unk> <unk> could indicate the presence of water in the polar craters , the current evidence is far from definitive . There are doubts among scientists as to whether or not the hydrogen is in the form of ice , as well as to the concentration of this " ore " with depth below the surface . Resolution of this issue will require future missions to the Moon . The presence of water suggests that the crater floor could potentially be " mined " for deposits of hydrogen in water form , a commodity that is expensive to deliver directly from the Earth . 
 This crater has also been proposed as a future site for a large infrared telescope . The low temperature of the crater floor makes it ideal for infrared observations , and solar cells placed along the rim could provide near @-@ continuous power to the observatory . About 120 kilometers from the crater lies the 5 @-@ km tall <unk> Mountain , a peak that is <unk> visible from the Earth , and which could serve as a radio relay station when suitably equipped . 
 NASA has named the rim of <unk> as a potential candidate for its lunar outpost , slated to be up and running by <unk> and continuously staffed by a crew by <unk> . The location would promote self @-@ <unk> for lunar residents , as perpetual sunlight on the south pole would provide energy for solar panels . Furthermore , the shadowed polar regions are believed to contain the frozen water necessary for human consumption and could also be harvested for fuel manufacture . 
 Ball began writing American Beauty as a play in the early 1990s , partly inspired by the media circus around the Amy Fisher trial in 1992 . He <unk> the play after realizing the story would not work on stage . After several years as a television screenwriter , Ball revived the idea in 1997 when attempting to break into the film industry . The modified script had a cynical outlook that was influenced by Ball 's frustrating <unk> writing for several sitcoms . <unk> Dan <unk> and Bruce Cohen took American Beauty to DreamWorks ; the then @-@ fledgling film studio bought Ball 's script for $ 250 @,@ 000 , <unk> several other production bodies . DreamWorks financed the $ 15 million production and served as its North American distributor . American Beauty marked acclaimed theater director <unk> ' film debut ; <unk> after his successful productions of the musicals Oliver ! and <unk> , <unk> was , nevertheless , only given the job after 20 others were considered and several " A @-@ list " directors turned down the opportunity . 
 Spacey was <unk> ' first choice for the role of Lester , though DreamWorks had urged the director to consider better @-@ known actors ; similarly , the studio suggested several actors for the role of Carolyn until <unk> offered the part to <unk> without DreamWorks ' knowledge . Principal photography took place between December 1998 and February 1999 on soundstages at the Warner Bros. <unk> in Burbank , California , and on location in Los Angeles . <unk> ' dominant style was deliberate and composed ; he made extensive use of static shots and slow pans and <unk> to generate tension . <unk> Conrad Hall complemented <unk> ' style with peaceful shot compositions to contrast with the turbulent on @-@ screen events . During editing , <unk> made several changes that gave the film a less cynical tone than the script . 
 Released in North America on September 17 , 1999 , American Beauty was positively received by critics and audiences ; it was the best @-@ reviewed American film of the year and grossed over $ <unk> million worldwide . Reviewers praised most aspects of the production , with particular emphasis on <unk> , Spacey , and Ball ; criticism focused on the familiarity of the characters and setting . DreamWorks launched a major campaign to increase the film 's chances of Academy Award success ; at the 72nd Academy Awards the following year , the film won Best Picture , Best Director , Best Actor ( for Spacey ) , Best Original Screenplay , and Best <unk> . It was nominated for and won many other awards and honors , mainly for the direction , writing , and acting .

A <unk> Col. <unk> returns home , where a gun is shown to be missing from his collection . Lester 's closing narration describes meaningful experiences during his life ; he says that , despite his death , he is happy because there is " so much beauty " in the world . 
 American Beauty follows a traditional narrative structure , only <unk> with the displaced opening scene of Jane and Ricky from the middle of the story . Although the plot spans one year , the film is narrated by Lester at the moment of his death . Jacqueline <unk> says that the plot " occupies [ ... ] no time [ or ] all time " , citing Lester 's claim that life did not flash before his eyes , but that it " stretches on forever like an ocean of time " . <unk> argues that a " rhythm of repetition " forms the core of the film 's structure . For example , two scenes have the <unk> sitting down to an evening meal , shot from the same angle . Each image is broadly similar , with minor differences in object placement and body language that reflect the changed dynamic brought on by Lester 's new @-@ found assertiveness . Another example is the pair of scenes in which Jane and Ricky film each other . Ricky films Jane from his bedroom window as she removes her bra , and the image is reversed later for a similarly " <unk> and <unk> " scene in which Jane films Ricky at a vulnerable moment . 
 According to Drew Miller of <unk> , the soundtrack " [ gives ] unconscious voice " to the characters ' <unk> and <unk> the subtext . The most obvious use of pop music " accompanies and gives context to " Lester 's attempts to recapture his youth ; reminiscent of how the counterculture of the 1960s <unk> American repression through music and drugs , Lester begins to smoke cannabis and listen to rock music . <unk> ' song choices " progress through the history of American popular music " . Miller argues that although some may be over familiar , there is a <unk> element at work , " making good on [ the film 's ] encouragement that viewers look closer " . Toward the end of the film , Thomas Newman 's score features more prominently , creating " a disturbing tempo " that matches the tension of the visuals . The exception is " Don 't Let It <unk> You Down " , which plays during Angela 's seduction of Lester . At first appropriate , its tone clashes as the seduction stops . The lyrics , which speak of " castles burning " , can be seen as a metaphor for Lester 's view of Angela — " the <unk> , fantasy @-@ driven exterior of the ' American Beauty ' " — as it burns away to reveal " the timid , small @-@ <unk> girl who , like his wife , has <unk> developed a false public self " . 
 Ball did not expect to sell the script , believing it would act as more of a calling card , but American Beauty drew interest from several production bodies . <unk> passed the script to several producers , including Dan <unk> and Bruce Cohen , who took it to DreamWorks . With the help of executives Glenn <unk> and Bob Cooper , and Steven Spielberg in his capacity as studio partner , Ball was convinced to develop the project at DreamWorks ; he received <unk> from the studio — known at the time for its more conventional fare — that it would not " iron the [ edges ] out " . In an unusual move , DreamWorks decided not to option the script ; instead , in April 1998 , the studio bought it outright for $ 250 @,@ 000 , <unk> Fox <unk> Pictures , October Films , Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer , and <unk> Entertainment . DreamWorks planned to make the film for $ 6 – 8 million . 
 Ball was partly inspired by two encounters he had in the early 1990s . In about 1991 – 92 , Ball saw a plastic bag blowing in the wind outside the World Trade Center . He watched the bag for 10 minutes , saying later that it provoked an " unexpected emotional response " . In 1992 , Ball became preoccupied with the media circus around the Amy Fisher trial . <unk> a comic book telling of the scandal , he was struck by how quickly it had become <unk> . He said he " felt like there was a real story underneath [ that was ] more fascinating and way more tragic " than the story presented to the public , and attempted to turn the idea into a play . Ball produced around 40 pages , but stopped when he realized it would work better as a film . He felt that because of the visual themes , and because each character 's story was .. " intensely personal " , it could not be done on a stage . All the main characters appeared in this version , but Carolyn did not feature strongly ; Jim and Jim instead had much larger roles . 
 Ball based Lester 's story on aspects of his own life . Lester 's re @-@ examination of his life parallels feelings Ball had in his mid @-@ 30s ; like Lester , Ball put aside his <unk> to work in jobs he hated for people he did not respect . Scenes in Ricky 's household reflect Ball 's own childhood experiences . Ball suspected his father was homosexual and used the idea to create Col. <unk> , a man who " gave up his chance to be himself " . Ball said the script 's mix of comedy and drama was not intentional , but that it came <unk> from his own outlook on life . He said the juxtaposition produced a <unk> contrast , giving each trait more impact than if they appeared alone . 
 Ball remained involved throughout production ; he had signed a television show development deal , so had to get permission from his producers to take a year off to be close to American Beauty . Ball was on @-@ set for <unk> and to help interpret his script for all but two days of filming . His original <unk> scenes — in which Ricky and Jane are <unk> for Lester 's murder after being framed by Col. <unk> — were <unk> in post @-@ production ; the writer later felt the scenes were unnecessary , saying they were a reflection of his " anger and cynicism " at the time of writing ( see " Editing " ) . Ball and <unk> revised the script twice before it was sent to the actors , and twice more before the first read @-@ through . 
 The shooting script features a scene in Angela 's car in which Ricky and Jane talk about death and beauty ; the scene differed from earlier versions , which set it as a " big scene on a freeway " in which the three witness a car crash and see a dead body . The change was a practical decision , as the production was behind schedule and they needed to cut costs . The schedule called for two days to be spent filming the crash , but only half a day was available . Ball agreed , but only if the scene could retain a line of Ricky 's where he reflects on having once seen a dead homeless woman : " When you see something like that , it 's like God is looking right at you , just for a second . And if you 're careful , you can look right back . " Jane asks : " And what do you see ? " Ricky : " Beauty . " Ball said , " They wanted to cut that scene . They said it 's not important . I said , ' You 're out of your fucking mind . It 's one of the most important scenes in the movie ! ' [ ... ] If any one line is the heart and soul of this movie , that is the line . " Another scene was rewritten to accommodate the loss of the freeway sequence ; set in a <unk> , it presents a " turning point " for Jane in that she chooses to walk home with Ricky instead of going with Angela . By the end of filming , the script had been through 10 drafts . 
 <unk> insisted on two weeks of cast rehearsals , although the sessions were not as formal as he was used to in the theater , and the actors could not be present at every one . Several <unk> and suggestions by the actors were incorporated into the script . An early scene showing the <unk> leaving home for work was inserted later on to show the low point that Carolyn and Lester 's relationship had reached . Spacey and <unk> worked to create a sense of the love that Lester and Carolyn once had for one another ; for example , the scene in which Lester almost <unk> Carolyn after the pair argues over Lester 's buying a car was originally " strictly contentious " . 
 <unk> encouraged some improvisation ; for example , when Lester <unk> in bed beside Carolyn , the director asked Spacey to improvise several <unk> for the act in each take . <unk> said , " I wanted that not just because it was funny [ ... ] but because I didn 't want it to seem <unk> . I wanted it to seem like he was <unk> it out of his mouth without thinking . [ Spacey ] is so in control — I wanted him to break through . " Spacey obliged , eventually coming up with 35 phrases , but <unk> could not always keep a straight face , which meant the scene had to be shot 10 times . The production used small amounts of computer @-@ generated imagery . Most of the rose <unk> in Lester 's fantasies were added in post @-@ production , although some were real and had the wires holding them digitally removed . When Lester <unk> about Angela in a rose @-@ <unk> bath , the steam was real , save for in the overhead shot . To position the camera , a hole had to be cut in the ceiling , through which the steam escaped ; it was instead added digitally . 
 <unk> spent more time <unk> the first 10 minutes than the rest of the film taken together . He <unk> several versions of the opening ; the first edit included <unk> scenes in which Jane and Ricky are convicted of Lester 's murder , but <unk> <unk> these in the last week of editing because he felt they made the film lose its mystery , and because they did not fit with the theme of redemption that had emerged during production . <unk> believed the trial drew focus away from the characters and turned the film " into an episode of <unk> Blue " . Instead , he wanted the ending to be " a poetic mixture of dream and memory and narrative resolution " . When Ball first saw a completed edit , it was a version with truncated versions of these scenes . He felt that they were so short that they " didn 't really register " . <unk> and he argued , but Ball was more accepting after <unk> cut the sequences completely ; Ball felt that without the scenes , the film was more optimistic and had evolved into something that " for all its darkness had a really romantic heart " . 
 Conrad Hall was not the first choice for director of photography ; <unk> believed he was " too old and too experienced " to want the job , and he had been told that Hall was difficult to work with . Instead , <unk> asked Fred <unk> , who turned the job down because he did not like the script . Hall was recommended to <unk> by Tom Cruise , because of Hall 's work on Without <unk> ( 1998 ) , which Cruise had executive produced . <unk> was directing Cruise 's then @-@ wife Nicole Kidman in the play The Blue Room during <unk> on American Beauty , and had already <unk> the whole film . Hall was involved for one month during <unk> ; his ideas for lighting the film began with his first reading of the script , and further passes allowed him to refine his approach before meeting <unk> . Hall was initially concerned that audiences would not like the characters ; he only felt able to identify with them during cast rehearsals , which gave him fresh ideas on his approach to the visuals . 
 A shot where Lester and Ricky share a cannabis joint behind a building came from a misunderstanding between Hall and <unk> . <unk> asked Hall to prepare the shot in his absence ; Hall assumed the characters would look for privacy , so he placed them in a narrow passage between a truck and the building , intending to light from the top of the truck . When <unk> returned , he explained that the characters did not care if they were seen . He removed the truck and Hall had to rethink the lighting ; he lit it from the left , with a large light crossing the actors , and with a soft light behind the camera . Hall felt the consequent wide shot " worked perfectly for the tone of the scene " . Hall made sure to keep rain , or the suggestion of it , in every shot near the end of the film . In one shot during Lester 's encounter with Angela at the <unk> ' home , Hall created rain effects on the foreground cross lights ; in another , he partly lit the pair through French windows to which he had added material to make the rain run slower , intensifying the light ( although the strength of the outside light was unrealistic for a night scene , Hall felt it justified because of the strong contrasts it produced ) . For the close @-@ ups when Lester and Angela move to the <unk> , Hall tried to keep rain in the frame , lighting through the window onto the ceiling behind Lester . He also used rain boxes to produce rain patterns where he wanted without lighting the entire room . 
 Thomas Newman 's score was recorded in Santa Monica , California . He mainly used percussion instruments to create the mood and rhythm , the inspiration for which was provided by <unk> . Newman " favored pulse , rhythm , and color over melody " , making for a more <unk> score than he had previously created . He built each cue around " small , <unk> repeating phrases " — often , the only variety through a " thinning of the texture for eight bars " . The percussion instruments included <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , piano , <unk> , and <unk> ; also featured were guitars , flute , and world music instruments . Newman also used electronic music and on " <unk> " tracks employed more unorthodox methods , such as tapping metal mixing bowls with a finger and using a <unk> mandolin . Newman believed the score helped move the film along without disturbing the " moral ambiguity " of the script : " It was a real delicate balancing act in terms of what music worked to preserve [ that ] . " 
 The soundtrack features songs by Newman , Bobby <unk> , The Who , Free , <unk> , The <unk> Who , Bill <unk> , Betty Carter , Peggy Lee , The Folk <unk> , Gomez , and Bob Dylan , as well as two cover versions — The Beatles ' " Because " performed by Elliott Smith , and Neil Young 's " Don 't Let It <unk> You Down " performed by Annie Lennox . Produced by the film 's music supervisor Chris <unk> , an abridged soundtrack album was released on October 5 , 1999 , and went on to be nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Soundtrack Album . An album featuring 19 tracks from Newman 's score was released on January 11 , 2000 , and won the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album . <unk> considered the score to be one of Newman 's best , saying it " [ enabled ] the film 's <unk> aspirations " . In 2006 , the magazine chose the score as one of 20 essential soundtracks it believed spoke to the " complex and innovative relationships between music and screen storytelling " . 
 DreamWorks contracted Amazon.com to create the official website , marking the first time that Amazon had created a special section devoted to a feature film . The website included an overview , a photo gallery , cast and crew <unk> , and exclusive interviews with Spacey and <unk> . The film 's tagline — " look closer " — originally came from a cutting <unk> on Lester 's workplace <unk> by the set <unk> . DreamWorks ran parallel marketing campaigns and trailers — one aimed at adults , the other at teenagers . Both trailers ended with the poster image of a girl holding a rose . Reviewing the posters of several 1999 films , David <unk> of Entertainment Weekly rated American Beauty 's highly , saying it evoked the tagline ; he said , " You return to the poster again and again , thinking , this time you 're gonna find something . " DreamWorks did not want to test screen the film ; according to <unk> , the studio was pleased with it , but he insisted on one where he could question the audience afterward . The studio <unk> agreed and showed the film to a young audience in San Jose , California . <unk> claimed the screening went very well . 
 The film had its world premiere on September 8 , 1999 , at <unk> 's Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles . Three days later , the film appeared at the Toronto International Film Festival . With the filmmakers and cast in attendance , it screened at several American universities , including the University of California at Berkeley , New York University , the University of California at Los Angeles , the University of Texas at Austin , and Northwestern University . 
 On September 15 , 1999 , American Beauty opened to the public in limited release at three theaters in Los Angeles and three in New York . More theaters were added during the limited run , and on October 1 , the film officially entered wide release by screening in <unk> theaters across North America . The film grossed $ 8 @,@ 188 @,@ <unk> over the weekend , ranking third at the box office . <unk> <unk> by the market research firm <unk> gave American Beauty a " B + " grade on average . The theater count hit a high of 1 @,@ <unk> at the end of the month , before a gradual decline . Following American Beauty 's wins at the 57th Golden Globe Awards , DreamWorks re @-@ expanded the theater presence from a low of 7 in mid @-@ February , to a high of 1 @,@ 990 in March . The film ended its North American theatrical run on June 4 , 2000 , having grossed $ 130 @.@ 1 million . 
 American Beauty had its European premiere at the London Film Festival on November 18 , 1999 ; in January 2000 , it began to screen in various territories outside North America . It debuted in Israel to " potent " returns , and limited releases in Germany , Italy , Austria , Switzerland , the Netherlands and Finland followed on January 21 . After January 28 opening weekends in Australia , the United Kingdom , Spain and Norway , American Beauty had earned $ 7 million in 12 countries for a total of $ 12 @.@ 1 million outside North America . On February 4 , American Beauty debuted in France and Belgium . <unk> to <unk> theaters in the United Kingdom , the film ranked first at the box office with $ 1 @.@ 7 million . On the weekend of February 18 — following American Beauty 's eight nominations for the 72nd Academy Awards — the film grossed $ 11 @.@ 7 million from 21 territories , for a total of $ 65 @.@ 4 million outside North America . The film had " dazzling " <unk> in Hungary , Denmark , the Czech Republic , <unk> , and New Zealand . 
 As of February 18 , the most successful territories were the United Kingdom ( $ 15 @.@ 2 million ) , Italy ( $ 10 @.@ 8 million ) , Germany ( $ 10 @.@ 5 million ) , Australia ( $ 6 million ) , and France ( $ 5 @.@ 3 million ) . The Academy Award nominations meant strong performances continued across the board ; the following weekend , American Beauty grossed $ 10 @.@ 9 million in 27 countries , with strong <unk> in Brazil , Mexico , and South Korea . Other high spots included robust returns in Argentina , Greece , and Turkey . On the weekend of March 3 , 2000 , American Beauty debuted strongly in Hong Kong , Taiwan , and Singapore , markets traditionally " not receptive to this kind of <unk> fare " . The impressive South Korean performance continued , with a return of $ 1 @.@ 2 million after nine days . In total , American Beauty grossed $ 130 @.@ 1 million in North America and $ 226 @.@ 2 million internationally , for $ <unk> @.@ 3 million worldwide . 
 The DVD release included a behind @-@ the @-@ scenes <unk> , film audio commentary from <unk> and Ball , and a storyboard presentation with discussion from <unk> and Hall . In the film commentary , <unk> refers to deleted scenes he intended to include in the release . However , these scenes are not on the DVD , as he changed his mind after recording the commentary ; <unk> felt that to show scenes he previously chose not to use would <unk> from the film 's integrity . 
 On September 21 , 2010 , Paramount Home Entertainment released American Beauty on Blu @-@ ray , as part of Paramount 's <unk> Series . All the extras from the DVD release were present , with the theatrical trailers upgraded to HD . 
 American Beauty was widely considered the best film of 1999 by the American press . It received overwhelming praise , chiefly for Spacey , <unk> and Ball . Variety reported that " no other 1999 movie has benefited from such universal <unk> . " It was the best @-@ received title at the Toronto International Film Festival ( <unk> ) , where it won the People 's Choice award after a ballot of the festival 's audiences . <unk> 's director , Piers <unk> , said , " American Beauty was the <unk> of the festival , the film most talked @-@ about . " 
 A few months after the film 's release , reports of a backlash appeared in the American press , and the years since have seen its critical regard <unk> . In 2005 , <unk> named American Beauty as one of 20 " most <unk> movies of all time " ; <unk> accepted the <unk> of the critical <unk> , saying , " I thought some of it was entirely justified — it was a little <unk> at the time . " 
 Currently , the film holds an 88 % score on Rotten Tomatoes based on 180 reviews , with an average rating of 8 @.@ 2 / 10 ; the critical consensus reads , " <unk> cast and <unk> with dark , acid wit , American Beauty is a smart , provocative high point of late ' 90s mainstream Hollywood film . " Metacritic gives the film a score of 86 , based on 33 reviews , indicating " universal acclaim . " 
 American Beauty was not considered an immediate favorite to dominate the American awards season . Several other contenders opened at the end of 1999 , and US critics spread their honors among them when compiling their end @-@ of @-@ year lists . The Chicago Film Critics Association and the Broadcast Film Critics Association named the film the best of 1999 , but while the New York Film Critics Circle , the National Society of Film Critics and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association recognized American Beauty , they gave their top awards to other films . By the end of the year , reports of a critical backlash suggested American Beauty was the underdog in the race for Best Picture ; however , at the Golden Globe Awards in January 2000 , American Beauty won Best Film , Best Director and Best Screenplay . 
 As the nominations for the 72nd Academy Awards approached , a <unk> had not emerged . DreamWorks had launched a major campaign for American Beauty five weeks before ballots were due to be sent to the 5 @,@ 600 Academy Award voters . Its campaign combined traditional advertising and publicity with more focused strategies . Although direct mail campaigning was prohibited , DreamWorks reached voters by promoting the film in " casual , comfortable settings " in voters ' communities . The studio 's candidate for Best Picture the previous year , Saving Private Ryan , lost to Shakespeare in Love , so the studio took a new approach by hiring outsiders to provide input for the campaign . It hired three veteran consultants , who told the studio to " think small " . Nancy <unk> encouraged DreamWorks to produce a special about the making of American Beauty , to set up displays of the film in the communities ' <unk> , and to arrange a question @-@ and @-@ answer session with <unk> for the British Academy of Film and Television Arts . Dale <unk> advised the studio to advertise in free publications that circulated in Beverly Hills — home to many voters — in addition to major newspapers . <unk> arranged to screen American Beauty to about 1 @,@ 000 members of the Actors Fund of America , as many participating actors were also voters . Bruce Feldman took Ball to the Santa Barbara International Film Festival , where Ball attended a private dinner in honor of Anthony Hopkins , meeting several voters who were in attendance . 
 In February 2000 , American Beauty was nominated for eight Academy Awards ; its closest rivals , The Cider House Rules and The <unk> , received seven nominations each . In March 2000 , the major industry labor organizations all awarded their top honors to American Beauty ; perceptions had shifted — the film was now the favorite to dominate the Academy Awards . American Beauty 's closest rival for Best Picture was still The Cider House Rules , from <unk> . Both studios mounted aggressive campaigns ; DreamWorks bought 38 % more advertising space in Variety than <unk> . On March 26 , 2000 , American Beauty won five Academy Awards : Best Picture , Best Director , Best Actor ( Spacey ) , Best Original Screenplay and Best <unk> . At the 53rd British Academy Film Awards , American Beauty won six of the 14 awards for which it was nominated : Best Film , Best Actor , Best Actress ( <unk> ) , Best <unk> , Best Film Music and Best Editing . In 2000 , the <unk> Guild of America recognized DreamWorks for the best film publicity campaign . In September 2008 , Empire named American Beauty the <unk> " Greatest Movie of All Time " after a poll of 10 @,@ 000 readers , 150 filmmakers , and 50 film critics , the fourth @-@ highest ranked movie from 1999 ( behind Fight Club , The Matrix , and Magnolia ) . In 2013 , the Writers Guild of America ranked the screenplay number 38 on its list of 101 greatest screenplays . 
 Christopher <unk> ( September 21 , 1758 – March 1 , 1827 ) was a prominent Massachusetts lawyer , <unk> politician , and U.S. diplomat . Born into a family divided by the American Revolution , <unk> sided with the victorious <unk> , established a successful law practice in Boston , and built a fortune by purchasing Revolutionary government debts at a discount and receiving full value for them from the government . 
 <unk> entered politics in 1788 , serving briefly in the Massachusetts legislature before being appointed U.S. District Attorney for Massachusetts . He was then appointed by President George Washington to a diplomatic commission dealing with maritime claims in Great Britain . He returned to Massachusetts in 1804 and <unk> state politics , running unsuccessfully for governor several times before winning in 1809 . He served one term , losing to Democratic @-@ Republican Elbridge Gerry in 1810 . He was appointed to the US Senate by Governor Caleb Strong in 1813 , where he led opposition to the War of 1812 . 
 <unk> invested his fortune in a variety of businesses , including important infrastructure projects such as the Middlesex Canal and a bridge across the Charles River . He was a major <unk> in the early textile industry , funding the Boston Manufacturing Company and the <unk> Manufacturing Company , whose business established the city of Lowell , Massachusetts . <unk> was involved in a variety of charitable causes , and was a major benefactor of Harvard College , where the first library was named in his honor . His palatial mansion in <unk> , Massachusetts , now known as <unk> Place , is one of the finest extant examples of <unk> architecture , and has been declared a National Historic Landmark . 
 Christopher <unk> was born in Boston on September 21 , 1758 , one of many children of Frances and John <unk> , a successful merchant and <unk> . He was the youngest of their three sons to survive to adulthood . He attended Boston Latin School , and entered Harvard College at the young ( even for the time ) age of thirteen . At the outset of the American Revolutionary War and the Siege of Boston in 1775 , Harvard 's buildings were occupied by the Continental Army , and <unk> temporarily continued his studies in Bradford until Harvard could resume operations in Concord . While at Harvard <unk> participated in a speaking club , and formed significant lifelong friendships with Rufus King and John <unk> . 
 <unk> graduated in 1776 , and promptly enlisted in the Continental artillery regiment of his brother @-@ in @-@ law Thomas <unk> , where he served as a clerk until 1778 . The <unk> family was divided by the war : <unk> 's father was a <unk> who left Boston when the British Army evacuated the city in March 1776 . <unk> was consequently called upon to support his mother and three sisters , who remained in Boston . In 1779 <unk> successfully petitioned the state for the remaining family 's share of his father 's seized assets . 
 After his military service <unk> studied law with John Lowell , and was admitted to the bar in 1778 after a comparatively brief tutelage . <unk> 's law practice flourished , in part because many <unk> lawyers had fled Massachusetts . <unk> 's clients included <unk> seeking to recover some of their assets , as well as London @-@ based British merchants with claims to pursue . His <unk> were generally well @-@ reasoned , and he was seen as a successful trial lawyer . 
 <unk> grew his fortune by investing carefully in revolutionary currency and bonds . The <unk> he purchased were paper that had been given to Continental Army soldiers in lieu of pay , which they often sold at a steep discount . One batch of <unk> he purchased , for instance , cost him about $ 3 @,@ 700 but had a face value of $ 25 @,@ 000 . In 1785 he married Rebecca <unk> Payne , daughter of a wealthy merchant , maritime <unk> , and director of the Bank of Massachusetts . The couple were known for their social <unk> and became prominent members of Boston society . 
 In 1788 <unk> was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives . He took a leading role in adopting the state 's rules for actions required of it by the new federal constitution . By his proposal the legislature decided that presidential electors would be chosen by a joint session . He also proposed that the state House and Senate agree by separate votes on choices for the United States Senate , a process that would significantly reduce popular input to the choice . His choice was ultimately rejected in favor of a process whereby the House selected a slate of candidates , from which the Senate would choose one . In 1789 <unk> decided to stand for reelection , but lost , owing to strong anti @-@ nationalist fervor in Boston at the time . He managed to win a seat later , when a special election was held after <unk> opened several seats . 
 <unk> 's financial speculations in the late <unk> significantly multiplied his wealth . In 1788 he and Andrew <unk> , a Boston businessman who had retained <unk> for legal services , entered into a secret agreement to purchase Continental <unk> with a face value of $ 100 @,@ 000 in a speculative bid that their value would rise . By late October of that year , the pair had met this goal : <unk> had purchased $ 90 @,@ 000 worth of paper for about $ 20 @,@ 000 , and encouraged <unk> to purchase more than the $ 11 @,@ 000 he had acquired if his funding would allow for it . <unk> also purchased Massachusetts war @-@ related debts , and lobbied Massachusetts <unk> for the U.S. government to assume those as well . 
 <unk> 's <unk> was realized when in 1790 the United States Congress , acting on a proposal made by Alexander Hamilton and supported by <unk> 's friend Rufus King , passed legislation that exchanged Continental and state paper for new U.S. paper at face value . Not only did <unk> win on this exchange , but the paper he received appreciated in value before he sold it . The exact amount he made is unclear from the surviving documents : John <unk> Adams wrote that <unk> 's speculations made him the wealthiest lawyer in the country . 
 The success of <unk> 's speculations prompted him to enter a partnership with <unk> , William <unk> and Daniel Parker in an attempt to acquire U.S. foreign debt obligations on favorable terms . Parker was a business partner of <unk> 's , and <unk> was an influential New York businessman and Treasury Department official whose lavish lifestyle impressed <unk> . The partnership promoted sales of U.S. lands in Europe , and sought to acquire U.S. obligations to France . Although <unk> sank $ 10 @,@ 000 into this venture , it failed : more powerful and experienced Dutch <unk> <unk> the Americans . <unk> also engaged in other ventures with these partners , but apparently carefully stayed with financial speculations , and avoided the partners ' less successful land ventures . 
 Much of <unk> 's financial activity was mediated through the Bank of Massachusetts , where his father @-@ in @-@ law was a director . <unk> himself was elected to its board in 1785 , when he also became a shareholder . During his time on the board the bank <unk> its regulations on loan <unk> , a move that improved the stability of its capital . <unk> used the bank for most of his personal deposits , but also drew on lines of credit for as much as several thousand dollars . The bank shares he held paid relatively high <unk> until 1791 , when the bank received serious competition from the First Bank of the United States . 
 The Bank of the United States was established by Alexander Hamilton to provide stable banking services on a national scale , and sought to open a branch in Boston . Hamilton recruited heavily in the Bank of Massachusetts , and <unk> decided to make the move . He sold his shares in the Massachusetts bank , and became a director of the Boston branch of the U.S. Bank . He also purchased 200 shares in the new bank , a relatively large investment . <unk> was influential in making hiring decisions for the branch , and sought to merge state @-@ chartered banks into the organization , arguing that only a nationally chartered bank could provide consistent and stable service . <unk> resigned from the board in 1794 , citing the demands of his law practice . 
 <unk> 's financial successes enabled him to join the elite society of Boston . In 1789 he purchased a large mansion on fashionable <unk> Square , and also bought a country estate in <unk> that grew over time to 300 acres ( 120 ha ) . He had a house built on the estate , most of which he operated as a gentleman farmer . He and other similarly @-@ situated <unk> formed the Massachusetts Society for <unk> Agriculture , of which he served as a trustee for several years ; the organization was not seen as significantly contributing to advances in agriculture . 
 In 1789 President George Washington appointed <unk> the first United States Attorney for Massachusetts as a reward for his support . <unk> controversially refused to resign from the state legislature , arguing that the state constitution 's prohibitions against holding multiple offices did not apply to federal posts . He eventually resigned the legislative seat under protest because of pressure from his fellow legislators . 
 <unk> served as district attorney until 1796 . His principal matter of concern was the enforcement of U.S. neutrality with respect to the French Revolutionary Wars . He attempted several times to <unk> the French consul in Boston , Antoine <unk> , for <unk> and operating <unk> out of the Port of Boston , but he was <unk> by local <unk> that <unk> with the French . <unk> was eventually expelled on orders from President George Washington based on evidence provided by <unk> . 
 <unk> also promoted anti @-@ French sentiment with political writings in Massachusetts newspapers . Writing under the pseudonym " <unk> " , he denounced the formation of " Democratic Societies " formed to oppose <unk> policy and support pro @-@ French positions . He suggested to President Washington that someone be sent to England to negotiate with the British . John Jay traveled to London in 1794 and negotiated the Jay Treaty , whose ratification <unk> vocally supported . Although <unk> was hostile to French policy , he was on friendly terms with individual Frenchmen : he hosted the future French statesman <unk> when he visited the U.S. 
 In 1796 Washington appointed him as a commissioner representing the United States to handle maritime claims under the terms the Jay Treaty . As a result the <unk> moved to England that year , establishing a residence in the fashionable Hyde Park area . The commission was established to <unk> claims emanating from British <unk> of American vessels and cargoes , and from British claims relating to violations of American neutrality in the ongoing French Revolutionary Wars . It consisted of three Americans ( <unk> , William Pinkney , and John <unk> ) and two British commissioners ( John <unk> and Nicholas <unk> ) ; <unk> was chosen by the other four because he was deemed to sufficiently " fair @-@ minded " to cast deciding votes in the event of disagreements . That year he was also elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences . 
 Although <unk> was well received by the British establishment , the work suffered from what <unk> called a " <unk> of process " , and he considered requesting a transfer in 1798 . In 1800 it ground to a halt because another board established by the treaty to resolve outstanding Revolutionary War claims against the United States had not yet met , and the British stopped the claims processing until resolution of the other issues got underway . <unk> used this break to briefly return to America and assess the condition of his <unk> estate , where the house had been largely destroyed by fire in <unk> . After his return to London , with the commission work still stopped , he and Rebecca embarked on a tour of Europe . They visited Holland , Belgium , and Switzerland , and spent six months in Paris . During this trip , and later ones in England and Scotland , they took note of the architecture of country estates , and began planning a new house for their <unk> property . 
 The commission resumed its work in early 1802 , and had resolved all outstanding claims by August 1803 . It awarded $ 110 @,@ 000 to British claimants and over $ 6 million to American claimants . The lopsided result is due to the vastly larger number of American claims , but also to some key early decisions that favored American interpretations in the processing of the claims , and by a British administration that sought to remain in America 's good <unk> . 
 The <unk> 's social circle in England revolved around his good friend Rufus King , who was appointed Ambassador to Great Britain in 1796 , along with other Massachusetts expatriates . When King left his post in May 1803 he named <unk> to head the London embassy as <unk> d <unk> . Although President Thomas Jefferson never issued a formal appointment , the British government accepted his role for the two @-@ month interval between King 's departure and the arrival of James Monroe as King 's replacement . The <unk> sailed for Boston in the spring of 1804 . 
 Rebecca <unk> used their exposure to European country estates to design a lavish new building for their <unk> estate during their English <unk> . Designed with the assistance of French architect Joseph @-@ Guillaume <unk> and probably also influenced by the works of English architect Sir John <unk> , the house that was built upon their return to the United States in 1804 ( now known as <unk> Place ) is one of the finest extant examples of <unk> architecture . 
 In 1806 <unk> won election to the State Senate . That year the Republicans were in the majority , and the election for governor was close enough to require a <unk> . The legislature <unk> the ballots in a partisan manner ( for example , retaining ballots containing <unk> versions of Republican James Sullivan 's name and discarding similar ballots marked for <unk> Caleb Strong ) . <unk> and other <unk> raised a public <unk> , and the legislature relented , eventually <unk> Strong as the winner . 
 <unk> led the <unk> to victory in 1809 against Sullivan 's successor , Levi Lincoln , Sr. , who had taken over as acting governor upon Sullivan 's death late in 1808 . During <unk> 's term the principal domestic issue occupying state politics was a banking crisis stimulated by the federal policy of <unk> trade with Great Britain and France , then embroiled in the Napoleonic Wars . Although the crisis caused a number of bank failures in New England , Massachusetts banks largely escaped unscathed . 
 Foreign policy played a major role in <unk> 's administration . The legislature passed resolves opposing the federal government 's hardline policy against trade and diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom ( then embroiled in the Napoleonic Wars ) , and <unk> in early 1810 invited Francis James Jackson , who had been rejected as the UK 's ambassador to the US , to visit the state . This pressure may have played a role in President James Madison 's decision to renew relations with the UK and accept Jackson 's credentials . 
 <unk> was granted an honorary law degree from Harvard in 1809 . He served on the college 's Board of <unk> from 1810 to 1815 and as a Fellow from 1816 to 1820 . Harvard 's first library building , a Gothic structure built in 1838 of <unk> granite , was named in his honor , but was demolished when <unk> Library was built in its place in 1915 . ( This structure is found on the seal of the city of Cambridge . ) One of the residential Winthrop House 's buildings is called <unk> Hall in his honor . 
 In the spring of 1813 , he was appointed by Governor Caleb Strong to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated by the resignation of Senator James Lloyd . He served from May 5 , 1813 to May 30 , 1816 , winning reelection to the seat in 1814 . He opposed the ongoing War of 1812 in these years , with his earlier diplomatic experience providing valuable knowledge to <unk> interests . He expressed approval of the 1814 Hartford Convention in which the New England states aired grievances concerning Republican governance of the country and the conduct of the war . 
 <unk> <unk> to the Treaty of <unk> that ended the war , but was unhappy that the nation had not gained anything from the war . He resigned in June 1816 , unhappy with the politics of Washington and suffering from poor health . Although he was no longer active in politics , he continued to express opinions on the subjects of the day , opposing the 1820 Missouri <unk> and <unk> the " great <unk> & <unk> " of <unk> Governor John Brooks . 
 <unk> remained active in the administration of Harvard , and was active in a number of organizations , including the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Massachusetts Historical Society ( whose president he was from 1806 to 1818 ) . He was also elected a member of the American <unk> Society in 1814 . <unk> spent most of his later years at his country estate in <unk> , suffering from worsening <unk> <unk> that made walking increasingly difficult . His declining health and lack of social scene in <unk> led him in 1822 to return to Boston in the winters . He died on March 1 , 1827 in Boston and is buried in its <unk> <unk> Ground . 
 <unk> 's wife died in 1834 ; the couple had no children . The major <unk> of the <unk> estate was Harvard ( which received an estimated $ 100 @,@ 000 ) , although <unk> were also made to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Massachusetts Historical Society . The <unk> estate passed through several hands and was subdivided over time . The mansion was saved from demolition by the <unk> Place Society ( established for the purpose of preserving it ) , which now operates it as a museum . It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1970 . 
 <unk> ( / <unk> / ; Latin : <unk> Claudius Caesar Augustus <unk> ; 15 December 37 AD – 9 June 68 AD ) was Roman Emperor from 54 to 68 , and the last in the Julio @-@ <unk> dynasty . <unk> was adopted by his grand @-@ uncle Claudius to become his heir and successor , and succeeded to the throne in 54 following Claudius ' death . 
 <unk> focused much of his attention on diplomacy , trade and enhancing the cultural life of the empire , but according to the historian <unk> he was viewed by the Roman people as <unk> and corrupt . He ordered theatres built and promoted athletic games . During his reign , the <unk> general <unk> conducted a successful war and negotiated peace with the <unk> Empire . His general <unk> <unk> crushed a revolt in Britain . <unk> annexed the <unk> Kingdom to the empire and began the First Jewish – Roman War . 
 <unk> was <unk> to have had captured Christians dipped in oil and set on fire in his garden at night as a source of light . This view is based on the writings of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> , the main surviving sources for <unk> 's reign , but a few surviving sources paint <unk> in a more favourable light . Some sources , including some mentioned above , portray him as an emperor who was popular with the common Roman people , especially in the East . Some modern historians question the reliability of ancient sources when reporting on <unk> 's <unk> acts . 
 Through Octavia , <unk> was the great @-@ nephew of Caesar Augustus . <unk> 's father had been employed as a <unk> and was a member of <unk> 's staff when the latter travelled to the East ( some apparently think <unk> refers to Augustus 's adopted son <unk> Caesar here , but this is not likely ) . 
 <unk> 's father was described by <unk> as a murderer and a <unk> who was charged by Emperor <unk> with treason , adultery and <unk> . <unk> died , allowing him to escape these charges . <unk> 's father died of <unk> ( " <unk> " ) in 39 when <unk> was two . 
 Claudius had married twice before marrying Valeria <unk> . His previous marriages produced three children including a son , <unk> , who died at a young age . He had two children with <unk> – <unk> Octavia ( born 40 ) and <unk> ( born 41 ) . <unk> was executed by Claudius in the year 48 . 
 In 49 AD , Claudius married a fourth time , to <unk> 's mother <unk> , despite her being his niece . To aid Claudius politically , young <unk> was adopted in 50 and took the name <unk> Claudius Caesar <unk> <unk> ( see adoption in Rome ) . <unk> was older than his <unk> <unk> , and thus became heir to the throne . 
 <unk> was proclaimed an adult in 51 at the age of 14 . He was appointed <unk> , entered and first addressed the Senate , made joint public appearances with Claudius , and was featured in coinage . In 53 , he married his <unk> <unk> Octavia . 
 Claudius died in 54 and <unk> , taking the name <unk> Claudius Caesar Augustus <unk> , was established as Emperor . Though accounts vary , many ancient historians state <unk> poisoned Claudius . According to Pliny the Elder , she used poison mushrooms . It is not known how much <unk> knew or if he was even involved in the death of Claudius . 
 <unk> wrote " ... for even if he was not the instigator of the emperor 's death , he was at least privy to it , as he openly admitted ; for he used afterwards to <unk> mushrooms , the vehicle in which the poison was administered to Claudius , as " the food of the gods , " as the Greek <unk> has it . At any rate , after Claudius ' death he vented on him every kind of insult , in act and word , charging him now with <unk> and now with cruelty ; for it was a favourite joke of his to say that Claudius had ceased " to play the fool " among mortals , <unk> the first syllable of the word <unk> , and he <unk> many of his decrees and acts as the work of a <unk> and a <unk> . Finally , he neglected to <unk> the place where his body was burned except with a low and mean wall . " 
 In 54 , <unk> tried to sit down next to <unk> while he met with an Armenian envoy , but Seneca stopped her and prevented a <unk> scene ( as it was <unk> at that time for a woman to be in the same room as men doing official business ) . <unk> 's friends also <unk> <unk> and told <unk> to <unk> of his mother . 
 <unk> was reportedly unsatisfied with his marriage to Octavia and entered into an affair with <unk> <unk> , a former slave . In 55 , <unk> attempted to intervene in favor of Octavia and demanded that her son dismiss <unk> . <unk> , with the support of Seneca , resisted the intervention of his mother in his personal affairs . 
 With <unk> 's influence over her son severed , she reportedly began pushing for <unk> , <unk> 's <unk> , to become emperor . Nearly fourteen @-@ year @-@ old <unk> , heir @-@ designate prior to <unk> 's adoption , was still legally a minor , but was approaching legal adulthood . According to <unk> , <unk> hoped that with her support , <unk> , being the blood son of Claudius , would be seen as the true heir to the throne by the state over <unk> . However , the youth died suddenly and suspiciously on 12 February 55 , the very day before his proclamation as an adult had been set . 
 Her promise was fulfilled after <unk> consumed it at a dinner party from water used to cool his wine , which had already been <unk> , and succumbed within minutes . After the death of <unk> , <unk> was accused of <unk> Octavia and <unk> ordered her out of the imperial residence . 
 In 58 , <unk> became romantically involved with <unk> <unk> , the wife of his friend and future emperor <unk> . Reportedly because a marriage to <unk> and a divorce from Octavia did not seem politically feasible with <unk> alive , <unk> ordered the murder of his mother in 59 . A number of modern historians find this an unlikely motive as <unk> did not marry <unk> until 62 . 
 In 62 , <unk> 's adviser , <unk> , died . Additionally , Seneca was again faced with <unk> charges . Seneca asked <unk> for permission to retire from public affairs . <unk> divorced and banished Octavia on grounds of infertility , leaving him free to marry the pregnant <unk> . After public protests , <unk> was forced to allow Octavia to return from exile , but she was executed shortly after her return . 
 <unk> 's consolidation of power also included a slow <unk> of authority from the Senate . In 54 , <unk> promised to give the Senate powers equivalent to those under Republican rule . By 65 , <unk> complained that they had no power left and this led to the <unk> conspiracy . 
 When <unk> 's wife <unk> <unk> died in 65 , <unk> went into deep mourning . Her body was not <unk> , it was <unk> with spices , embalmed and put in the <unk> of Augustus . She was given a state funeral . <unk> praised her during the funeral <unk> and gave her divine honors . It is said that <unk> " burned ten years ' worth of Arabia 's incense production at her funeral . 
 In the beginning of 66 , he married <unk> <unk> . She was already married when she became <unk> 's mistress in 65 AD , with <unk> 's husband being driven to suicide in 66 , so <unk> could marry <unk> . She was one of the few of <unk> 's courtiers who survived the fall of his reign . 
 In 67 , <unk> ordered a young <unk> , <unk> , to be <unk> and then married him . According to Dion <unk> , <unk> bore an <unk> resemblance to <unk> , and <unk> even called him by his dead wife 's name . 
 Over the course of his reign , <unk> often made <unk> that pleased the lower class . <unk> was criticized as being obsessed with personal popularity . 
 <unk> began his reign in 54 by promising the Senate more autonomy . In this first year , he forbade others to refer to him with regard to <unk> , for which he was praised by the Senate . <unk> was known for spending his time visiting <unk> and <unk> during this period . 
 In 55 , <unk> began taking on a more active role as an administrator . He was consul four times between 55 and 60 . During this period , some ancient historians speak fairly well of <unk> and contrast it with his later rule . 
 Under <unk> , restrictions were put on the amount of bail and fines . Also , fees for lawyers were limited . There was a discussion in the Senate on the <unk> of the freedmen class , and a strong demand was made that patrons should have the right of <unk> freedom . <unk> supported the freedmen and ruled that patrons had no such right . 
 The Senate tried to pass a law in which the crimes of one slave applied to all slaves within a household . Despite riots from the people , <unk> supported the Senate on their measure , and deployed troops to organise the execution of 400 slaves affected by the law . However , he vetoed strong measures against the freedmen affected by the case . 
 After tax collectors were accused of being too harsh to the poor , <unk> transferred collection authority to lower commissioners . <unk> banned any magistrate or <unk> from exhibiting public entertainment for fear that the venue was being used as a method to sway the populace . Additionally , there were many <unk> and <unk> of government officials along with arrests for <unk> and corruption . 
 When further complaints arose that the poor were being overly <unk> , <unk> attempted to repeal all indirect taxes . The Senate convinced him this action would bankrupt the public treasury . As a compromise , taxes were cut from 4 @.@ 5 % to 2 @.@ 5 % . Additionally , secret government tax records were ordered to become public . To lower the cost of food imports , merchant ships were declared tax @-@ exempt . 
 In imitation of the Greeks , <unk> built a number of <unk> and theatres . <unk> <unk> shows were also held . <unk> also established the <unk> <unk> . The festival included games , poetry , and theater . Historians indicate that there was a belief that theatre led to <unk> . Others considered that to have performers dressed in Greek clothing was old fashioned . Some questioned the large public expenditure on entertainment . 
 In 64 , Rome burned . <unk> enacted a public relief effort as well as significant reconstruction . A number of other major construction projects occurred in <unk> 's late reign . <unk> had the marshes of <unk> filled with rubble from the fire . He erected the large <unk> <unk> . In 67 , <unk> attempted to have a canal dug at the Isthmus of <unk> . Ancient historians state that these projects and others exacerbated the drain on the State 's budget . 
 The cost to rebuild Rome was immense , requiring funds the state treasury did not have . <unk> <unk> the Roman currency for the first time in the Empire 's history . He reduced the weight of the <unk> from 84 per Roman pound to 96 ( 3 @.@ 85 grams to 3 @.@ 35 grams ) . He also reduced the silver purity from 99 @.@ 5 % to 93 @.@ 5 % — the silver weight dropping from 3 @.@ 83 grams to 3 @.@ 4 grams . Furthermore , <unk> reduced the weight of the <unk> from 40 per Roman pound to 45 ( 8 grams to 7 @.@ 2 grams ) . 
 Between 62 and 67 , according to <unk> the Elder and Seneca , <unk> promoted an expedition to discover the sources of the Nile River . It was the first exploration of equatorial Africa from Europe in history . However , <unk> 's expedition up the Nile failed upon reaching the impenetrable <unk> of present @-@ day South Sudan . 
 The economic policy of <unk> is a point of debate among scholars . According to ancient historians , <unk> 's construction projects were overly extravagant and the large number of <unk> under <unk> left Italy " thoroughly exhausted by contributions of money " with " the provinces ruined . " Modern historians , though , note that the period was riddled with <unk> and that it is likely that <unk> 's spending came in the form of public works projects and charity intended to ease economic troubles . 
 The Great Fire of Rome erupted on the night of 18 July to 19 July 64 . The fire started at the southeastern end of the Circus <unk> in shops selling flammable goods . 
 The extent of the fire is uncertain . According to <unk> , who was nine at the time of the fire , it spread quickly and burned for over five days . It destroyed three of fourteen Roman districts and severely damaged seven . The only other historian who lived through the period and mentioned the fire is Pliny the Elder , who wrote about it in passing . Other historians who lived through the period ( including <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ) make no mention of it in what remains of their work . 
 It is uncertain who or what actually caused the fire — whether accident or <unk> . <unk> and <unk> <unk> favor <unk> as the <unk> , so he could build a palatial complex . <unk> mentions that Christians confessed to the crime , but it is not known whether these <unk> were induced by torture . However , accidental fires were common in ancient Rome . In fact , Rome suffered other large fires in 69 and in 80 . 
 According to <unk> , upon hearing news of the fire , <unk> returned to Rome to organize a relief effort , which he paid for from his own funds . <unk> 's contributions to the relief extended to personally taking part in the search for and rescue of victims of the <unk> , spending days searching the debris without even his <unk> . After the fire , <unk> opened his palaces to provide shelter for the homeless , and arranged for food supplies to be delivered in order to prevent starvation among the survivors . 
 In the wake of the fire , he made a new urban development plan . Houses after the fire were spaced out , built in brick , and faced by <unk> on wide roads . <unk> also built a new palace complex known as the <unk> <unk> in an area cleared by the fire . This included lush artificial landscapes and a 30 @-@ meter @-@ tall statue of himself , the <unk> of <unk> . The size of this complex is debated ( from 100 to 300 acres ) . To find the necessary funds for the reconstruction , tributes were imposed on the provinces of the empire . 
 <unk> , in one of the earliest non @-@ Christian references to the origins of Christianity , notes that the population searched for a <unk> and rumors held <unk> responsible . To <unk> blame , <unk> targeted Christians . He ordered Christians to be thrown to dogs , while others were <unk> and burned . 
 <unk> enjoyed driving a one @-@ horse chariot , singing to the <unk> and poetry . He even composed songs that were performed by other <unk> throughout the empire . At first , <unk> only performed for a private audience . 
 In 64 AD . , <unk> began singing in public in <unk> in order to improve his popularity . He also sang at the second <unk> <unk> in 65 . It was said that <unk> <unk> the attention , but historians also write that <unk> was encouraged to sing and perform in public by the Senate , his inner circle and the people . Ancient historians strongly criticize his choice to perform , calling it <unk> . 
 <unk> was persuaded to participate in the Olympic Games of 67 in order to improve relations with Greece and display Roman dominance . As a competitor , <unk> raced a ten @-@ horse chariot and nearly died after being thrown from it . He also performed as an actor and a singer . Though <unk> <unk> in his racing ( in one case , dropping out entirely before the end ) and acting competitions , he won these crowns nevertheless and <unk> them when he returned to Rome . The victories are attributed to <unk> <unk> the judges and his status as emperor . 
 The peace did not last and full @-@ scale war broke out in 58 . The <unk> king <unk> I refused to remove his brother <unk> from Armenia . The <unk> began a full @-@ scale invasion of the Armenian kingdom . Commander <unk> responded and repelled most of the <unk> army that same year . <unk> retreated and Rome again controlled most of Armenia . 
 <unk> was acclaimed in public for this initial victory . <unk> , a <unk> noble raised in Rome , was installed by <unk> as the new ruler of Armenia . <unk> was appointed governor of Syria as a reward . 
 In 62 , <unk> invaded the <unk> province of <unk> . Again , Rome and <unk> were at war and this continued until 63 . <unk> began building up for a strike against the Roman province of Syria . <unk> tried to convince <unk> to continue the war , but <unk> opted for a peace deal instead . There was anxiety in Rome about eastern grain supplies and a budget deficit . 
 The result was a deal where <unk> again became the Armenian king , but was crowned in Rome by Emperor <unk> . In the future , the king of Armenia was to be a <unk> prince , but his appointment required approval from the Romans . <unk> was forced to come to Rome and <unk> in ceremonies meant to display Roman dominance . 
 This peace deal of 63 was a considerable victory for <unk> politically . <unk> became very popular in the eastern provinces of Rome and with the <unk> as well . The peace between <unk> and Rome lasted 50 years until Emperor Trajan of Rome invaded Armenia in 114 . 
 The war with <unk> was not <unk> 's only major war but he was both criticized and praised for an aversion to battle . Like many emperors , <unk> faced a number of rebellions and power struggles within the empire . 
 In 66 , there was a Jewish revolt in Judea stemming from Greek and Jewish religious tension . In 67 , <unk> dispatched <unk> to restore order . This revolt was eventually put down in 70 , after <unk> 's death . This revolt is famous for Romans breaching the walls of Jerusalem and destroying the Second Temple of Jerusalem . 
 At the Battle of <unk> in May 68 , <unk> ' forces easily defeated those of <unk> and the latter committed suicide . However , after putting down this one rebel , <unk> ' <unk> attempted to proclaim their own commander as Emperor . <unk> refused to act against <unk> , but the discontent of the <unk> of Germany and the continued opposition of <unk> in Spain did not <unk> well for him . 
 While <unk> had retained some control of the situation , support for <unk> increased despite his being officially declared a public enemy . The prefect of the <unk> Guard , <unk> <unk> <unk> , also abandoned his allegiance to the Emperor and came out in support for <unk> . 
 <unk> returned to Rome and spent the evening in the palace . After sleeping , he <unk> at about midnight to find the palace guard had left . <unk> messages to his friends ' palace chambers for them to come , he received no answers . Upon going to their chambers personally , he found them all abandoned . When he called for a <unk> or anyone else adept with a sword to kill him , no one appeared . He cried , " Have I neither friend nor <unk> ? " and ran out as if to throw himself into the Tiber . 
 Returning , <unk> sought for some place where he could hide and collect his thoughts . An imperial <unk> , <unk> , offered his villa , located 4 miles outside the city . Travelling in disguise , <unk> and four loyal freedmen , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , reached the villa , where <unk> ordered them to dig a grave for him . 
 When one of the horsemen entered , upon his seeing <unk> all but dead he attempted to stop the bleeding in vain . <unk> 's final words were " Too late ! This is fidelity ! " He died on 9 June 68 , the anniversary of the death of Octavia , and was buried in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , in what is now the Villa <unk> ( <unk> Hill ) area of Rome . 
 With his death , the Julio @-@ <unk> dynasty ended . The Senate , when news of his death reached Rome , posthumously declared <unk> a public enemy to appease the coming <unk> ( as the Senate had initially declared <unk> as a public enemy ) and proclaimed <unk> the new emperor . Chaos would ensue in the year of the Four <unk> . 
 Eastern sources , namely <unk> II and <unk> of <unk> , mention that <unk> 's death was <unk> as he " restored the liberties of <unk> with a wisdom and <unk> quite alien to his character " and that he " held our liberties in his hand and respected them . " 
 Modern scholarship generally holds that , while the Senate and more well @-@ off individuals welcomed <unk> 's death , the general populace was " loyal to the end and beyond , for <unk> and <unk> both thought it worthwhile to appeal to their nostalgia . " 
 <unk> 's name was erased from some monuments , in what Edward <unk> regards as an " outburst of private zeal " . Many portraits of <unk> were reworked to represent other figures ; according to Eric R. <unk> , over fifty such images survive . This reworking of images is often explained as part of the way in which the memory of disgraced emperors was condemned posthumously ( see <unk> <unk> ) . <unk> , however , doubts that the practice is necessarily negative and notes that some continued to create images of <unk> long after his death . 
 The civil war during the year of the Four <unk> was described by ancient historians as a <unk> period . According to <unk> , this instability was rooted in the fact that emperors could no longer rely on the perceived legitimacy of the imperial bloodline , as <unk> and those before him could . <unk> began his short reign with the execution of many allies of <unk> and possible future enemies . One such notable enemy included <unk> <unk> , who claimed to be the son of Emperor <unk> . 
 After <unk> 's suicide in 68 , there was a widespread belief , especially in the eastern provinces , that he was not dead and somehow would return . This belief came to be known as the <unk> <unk> Legend . 
 The legend of <unk> 's return lasted for hundreds of years after <unk> 's death . Augustine of <unk> wrote of the legend as a popular belief in 422 . 
 In his book The Lives of the Twelve <unk> , <unk> describes <unk> as " about the average height , his body marked with spots and <unk> , his hair light blonde , his features regular rather than attractive , his eyes blue and somewhat weak , his neck over thick , his belly prominent , and his legs very slender . " 
 A handful of other sources also add a limited and varying perspective on <unk> . Few surviving sources paint <unk> in a favourable light . Some sources , though , portray him as a competent emperor who was popular with the Roman people , especially in the east . 
 Books 61 – 63 of <unk> 's Roman History describe the reign of <unk> . Only fragments of these books remain and what does remain was abridged and altered by John <unk> , an 11th @-@ century monk . 
 <unk> <unk> ( c . 40 – 120 ) , a Greek philosopher and historian , wrote the Roman people were very happy with <unk> and would have allowed him to rule indefinitely . They <unk> for his rule once he was gone and embraced <unk> when they appeared : 
 Indeed the truth about this has not come out even yet ; for so far as the rest of his subjects were concerned , there was nothing to prevent his continuing to be Emperor for all time , seeing that even now everybody wishes he were still alive . And the great majority do believe that he still is , although in a certain sense he has died not once but often along with those who had been firmly convinced that he was still alive . 
 <unk> ( c . 55 – 135 ) was the slave to <unk> 's <unk> <unk> . He makes a few passing negative comments on <unk> 's character in his work , but makes no remarks on the nature of his rule . He describes <unk> as a spoiled , angry and unhappy man . 
 The historian <unk> ( c . 37 – 100 ) , while calling <unk> a <unk> , was also the first to mention bias against <unk> . Of other historians , he said : 
 But I <unk> any further discourse about these affairs ; for there have been a great many who have composed the history of <unk> ; some of which have departed from the truth of facts out of favour , as having received benefits from him ; while others , out of hatred to him , and the great ill @-@ will which they bore him , have so <unk> <unk> against him with their lies , that they <unk> deserve to be condemned . Nor do I wonder at such as have told lies of <unk> , since they have not in their writings preserved the truth of history as to those facts that were earlier than his time , even when the actors could have no way incurred their hatred , since those writers lived a long time after them . 
 Though more of a poet than historian , <unk> ( c . 39 – 65 ) has one of the <unk> accounts of <unk> 's rule . He writes of peace and prosperity under <unk> in contrast to previous war and <unk> . Ironically , he was later involved in a conspiracy to overthrow <unk> and was executed . 
 <unk> II " the <unk> " ( c . 172 – 250 ) spoke of <unk> in the Life of <unk> <unk> ( Books 4 – 5 ) . Though he has a generally bad or dim view of <unk> , he speaks of others ' positive reception of <unk> in the East . 
 The history of <unk> by Pliny the Elder ( c . 24 – 79 ) did not survive . Still , there are several references to <unk> in Pliny 's Natural <unk> . Pliny has one of the worst opinions of <unk> and calls him an " enemy of mankind . " 
 <unk> ( c . 46 – 127 ) mentions <unk> indirectly in his account of the Life of <unk> and the Life of <unk> . <unk> is portrayed as a <unk> , but those that replace him are not described as better . 
 It is not surprising that Seneca ( c . 4 BC – 65 ) , <unk> 's teacher and advisor , writes very well of <unk> . 
 <unk> ( c . 69 – 130 ) was a member of the <unk> order , and he was the head of the department of the imperial correspondence . While in this position , <unk> started writing biographies of the emperors , <unk> the <unk> and sensational aspects . 
 The Annals by <unk> ( c . 56 – 117 ) is the most detailed and comprehensive history on the rule of <unk> , despite being incomplete after the year 66 . <unk> described the rule of the Julio @-@ <unk> emperors as generally unjust . He also thought that existing writing on them was <unk> : 
 The histories of <unk> , <unk> , Claudius and <unk> , while they were in power , were falsified through terror , and after their death were written under the irritation of a recent hatred . 
 <unk> was the son of a <unk> , who married into the elite family of <unk> . He entered his political life as a senator after <unk> 's death and , by <unk> ' own admission , owed much to <unk> 's rivals . <unk> that this bias may be apparent to others , <unk> protests that his writing is true . 
 In <unk> <unk> <unk> published in Basel his <unk> <unk> , which was one of the first historical references of the Modern era to portray <unk> in a positive light . 
 At the end of 66 , conflict broke out between Greeks and Jews in Jerusalem and Caesarea . According to the Talmud , <unk> went to Jerusalem and shot arrows in all four directions . All the arrows landed in the city . He then asked a passing child to repeat the verse he had learned that day . The child responded , " I will lay my vengeance upon <unk> by the hand of my people Israel " ( <unk> . 25 @,@ 14 ) . <unk> became <unk> , believing that God wanted the Temple in Jerusalem to be destroyed , but would punish the one to carry it out . <unk> said , " He desires to lay waste His House and to lay the blame on me , " whereupon he fled and converted to Judaism to avoid such <unk> . <unk> was then dispatched to put down the rebellion . 
 Roman and Greek sources nowhere report <unk> 's alleged trip to Jerusalem or his alleged conversion to Judaism . There is also no record of <unk> having any offspring who survived infancy : his only recorded child , <unk> Augusta , died aged 4 months . 
 Non @-@ Christian historian <unk> describes <unk> extensively <unk> and executing Christians after the fire of 64 . <unk> also mentions <unk> punishing Christians , though he does so because they are " given to a new and mischievous superstition " and does not connect it with the fire . 
 The first text to suggest that <unk> ordered the execution of an <unk> is a letter by Clement to the <unk> traditional dated to around 96 <unk> The <unk> Ascension of Isaiah , a Christian writing from the 2nd century says , " the <unk> of his mother , who himself ( even ) this king , will <unk> the plant which the Twelve Apostles of the Beloved have planted . Of the Twelve one will be delivered into his hands " was interpreted to mean <unk> . 
 Bishop Eusebius of Caesarea ( c . 275 – <unk> ) was the first to write explicitly that Paul was beheaded in Rome during the reign of <unk> . He states that <unk> 's persecution led to Peter and Paul 's deaths , but that <unk> did not give any specific orders . However , several other accounts going back to the 1st century have Paul surviving his two years in Rome and travelling to <unk> , before facing trial in Rome again prior to his death . 
 Peter is first said to have been <unk> upside @-@ down in Rome during <unk> 's reign ( but not by <unk> ) in the <unk> Acts of Peter ( c . 200 ) . The account ends with Paul still alive and <unk> <unk> by God 's command not to <unk> any more Christians . 
 The <unk> <unk> , Book 5 and 8 , written in the 2nd century , speak of <unk> returning and bringing destruction . Within Christian communities , these writings , along with others , fueled the belief that <unk> would return as the <unk> . In 310 , <unk> wrote that <unk> " suddenly disappeared , and even the burial place of that <unk> wild beast was nowhere to be seen . This has led some persons of extravagant imagination to suppose that , having been conveyed to a distant region , he is still reserved alive ; and to him they apply the <unk> verses " , <unk> maintains that it is not right to believe this . 
 Some modern biblical scholars such as <unk> <unk> ( Johns Hopkins University ) of the American Schools of Oriental Research and the editors of the Oxford & Harper Collins Study Bibles , contend that the number <unk> in the Book of Revelation is a code for <unk> , a view that is also supported in Roman Catholic Biblical commentaries . 
 Manila ( / <unk> / ) is the capital city of the Philippines , founded on June 24 , <unk> by Spanish <unk> Miguel López de <unk> .

 Manila is the second most populous city in the Philippines after the former capital <unk> City with a population of 1 @,@ 780 @,@ 148 in 2015 . Because of its small land area and huge population , Manila is regarded as one of the most densely populated cities in the world with 42 @,@ <unk> people per square kilometer . Manila is one of the sixteen cities and a municipality that make up Metro Manila , the National Capital Region of the Philippines . In 2012 , <unk> and World Cities Research Network listed Manila as a global city .

Spanish missionaries soon <unk> the city and incorporated <unk> under Manila and then built some of the oldest churches in the country , including San Agustin Church . The <unk> renamed the area <unk> <unk> de <unk> ( New Kingdom of <unk> ) and shortened the name to Manila . 
 Manila became the center of Spanish activity in the Far East and one end of the Manila @-@ Acapulco <unk> trade route , linking Spanish America with Asia , one of the earliest examples of <unk> . Due to the central location in the Pacific sea trade routes , Manila received the moniker of the " Pearl of the <unk> " . Spanish rule of Manila and the entire Philippine archipelago lasted for over three centuries , until 1898 . At different times during the long Spanish period there were local <unk> , Chinese <unk> , massive pirate attacks , great earthquakes , Dutch raids and invasion attempts , and a British occupation of the city during their unsuccessful attempt to conquer the Philippines . Order was usually quickly restored and the city returned to the business of trade . In the 19th century Manila was one of the most modern cities in Asia . Before the Spanish – American War , Manila saw the rise of the Philippine Revolution . Under the American rule following the Spanish – American War , the United States changed the official language from Spanish to English and made some changes in education , local laws and urban planning .

The Chinese were punished for supporting the British invasion , and the small fortress @-@ city of <unk> , mostly populated by Europeans and <unk> , kept its cannons pointed at <unk> , the world 's oldest <unk> . 
 Mexican Independence in 1821 necessitated direct rule from Spain . Under direct Spanish rule , banking , industry and education flourished more than it had in the previous two centuries . The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 facilitated direct trade and communications with Spain . 
 The growing wealth and education attracted indigenous , Chinese , Indians , <unk> , and Europeans from the provinces to Manila , all of whom elected a nascent <unk> citizenship regardless of ethnicity .

The <unk> Plan included development of the road system , the use of waterways for transportation , and <unk> of Manila with the improvement of <unk> , construction of parks , <unk> and various building for various activities . 
 The latter included a government center occupying all of Wallace Field , which extends from <unk> to the present Taft Avenue . The Philippine Capitol was to rise at the Taft Avenue end of the field , facing toward the sea , and would form , with the buildings of different government <unk> and departments , a <unk> , <unk> in the center , and a monument to José <unk> at its <unk> end . Of <unk> 's proposed government center , only three units — the Legislative Building and the building of the Finance and Agricultural departments — were completed when World War II erupted .

 Manila has six legislative districts that serve as the constituencies for the election of the city 's representatives to the lower house of the Congress of the Philippines and of the regular members to the <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ; City Council ) . Each district elects one representative to the House of Representatives and six <unk> members to the council . The city , along with the rest of the nation , elects 12 <unk> as one at @-@ large district . 
 Manila is politically divided into <unk> <unk> , the smallest unit of local government in the Philippines . Each <unk> has its own <unk> and <unk> . For administrative convenience , all the <unk> in Manila are grouped into 100 zones . These zones have no form of local government . 
 The 1st District ( 2015 population : 415 @,@ <unk> ) is Manila 's ( and the country 's ) most densely populated congressional district . It covers the western portion of <unk> that lies along Manila Bay . 
 The 2nd District ( 2015 population : 215 @,@ 457 ) covers the eastern inland portion of <unk> , a neighborhood or sub @-@ district known as <unk> . 
 The 3rd District ( 2015 population : 197 @,@ 242 ) covers <unk> , <unk> , San Nicolas and Santa Cruz . 
 The 5th District ( 2015 population : 366 @,@ <unk> ) covers <unk> , <unk> , Port Area , <unk> , San Andres <unk> , and a portion of <unk> ( except Zone 90 ) . 
 The 6th District ( 2007 population : 295 @,@ 245 ) covers <unk> ( Zone 90 only ) , <unk> , San Miguel , Santa <unk> and Santa Mesa . 
 Manila has the most number of <unk> of any city or municipality in the Philippines . Attempts at reducing its number have not prospered despite local legislation — <unk> <unk> , passed on 23 April 1996 — reducing the number from <unk> to 150 by merging existing <unk> , because of the failure to hold a <unk> . 
 Manila , being the seat of political power of the Philippines , has several national government offices headquartered at the city . Planning for the development for being the center of government started during the early years of American colonization to the country when they envisioned a well @-@ designed city outside the walls of <unk> . The strategic location chosen was <unk> , a former town which is now the <unk> Park to become the center of government and a design commission was given to Daniel <unk> to create a master plan for the city patterned after Washington <unk> .. These improvements were eventually abandoned under the Commonwealth Government of Manuel L. <unk> . 
 A new government center was to be built on the hills northeast of Manila , or what is now <unk> City . Several government agencies have set up their headquarters in <unk> City but several key government offices still reside in Manila . However , many of the plans were substantially altered after the devastation of Manila during World War II and by subsequent administrations . 
 The city , as the capital , still hosts the Office of the President , as well as the president 's official residence . Aside from these , important institutions such as the Supreme Court , the Court of Appeals , the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , the <unk> of <unk> and Management , Finance , Health , Justice , Labor and <unk> and Public Works and Highways still call the city home . Manila also hosts important national institutions such as the National Library , National Archives , National Museum and the Philippine General Hospital . 
 Congress previously held office at the Old Congress Building . In 1972 , due to declaration of martial law , Congress was dissolved ; its successor , the unicameral <unk> <unk> , held office at the new <unk> <unk> Complex . When a new constitution restored the <unk> Congress , the House of Representatives stayed at the <unk> <unk> Complex , while the Senate remained at the Old Congress Building . In May 1997 , the Senate transferred to a new building it shares with the Government Service Insurance System at reclaimed land at <unk> . 
 Water services used to be provided by the Metropolitan <unk> and <unk> System , which served 30 % of the city with most other sewage being directly dumped into storm drains , <unk> tanks , or open canals . <unk> was <unk> in 1997 which split the water concession into the east and west zones . The <unk> Water Services took over the west zone of which Manila is a part . It now provides the supply and delivery of <unk> water and <unk> system in Manila , but it does not provide service to the southeastern part of the city which belongs to the east zone that is served by Manila Water . Electric services are provided by <unk> , the sole electric power distributor in Metro Manila . 
 One of the more famous modes of transportation in Manila is the <unk> . <unk> after U.S. army <unk> , these have been in use since the years immediately following World War II . The <unk> <unk> , the third generation Toyota <unk> , which competed directly with <unk> and followed fixed routes for a set price , once plied the streets of Manila . 
 The main terminal of the Philippine National Railways lies within the city . One commuter railway within Metro Manila is in operation . The line runs in a general north @-@ south direction from <unk> ( <unk> ) toward <unk> . The Port of Manila , located in the vicinity of Manila Bay is the chief seaport of the Philippines . The <unk> River Ferry Service which runs on the <unk> River is another form of transportation . The city is also served by the <unk> <unk> International Airport and Clark International Airport . 
 In 2006 , Forbes magazine ranked Manila " the world 's most <unk> city " . Manila has become notorious for its frequent traffic jams and high densities . The government has undertaken several projects to alleviate the traffic in the city . Some of the projects include : the construction of a new flyover at <unk> , the construction of the Metro Manila <unk> Stage 3 , the proposed <unk> Line 2 ( west ) extension from <unk> to <unk> or the Port Area , and the expansion of several national and local roads . However , such projects have yet to make any meaningful impact , and the traffic jams and congestion continue unabated . The urban planning of the Manila and the whole metropolis was based on the Metro Manila Dream Plan , which seeks to address the problems of Metro Manila 's urban planning and transportation . It consists of a list of short term priority projects and medium to long term infrastructure projects that will last up to <unk> . 
 Manila 's healthcare is also provided by private corporations . Private hospitals that operates in the city are the Manila Doctors Hospital , Chinese General Hospital and Medical Center , Dr. José R. Reyes Memorial Medical Center , Metropolitan Medical Center , Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital , and the University of Santo Tomas Hospital . 
 The Department of Health has its main office in Manila . The national health department also operates the San <unk> Hospital , a special referral tertiary hospital . Manila is also the home to the headquarters of the World Health Organization Regional Office for the Western Pacific and the World Health Organization Country Office for the Philippines . 
 The University of the City of Manila ( <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ) located at <unk> , and <unk> de Manila located just outside the walled city , are both owned and operated by the Manila city government . The national government controls the University of the Philippines Manila , the oldest of the University of the Philippines constituent universities and the center of health sciences education in the country . The city is also the site of the Polytechnic University of the Philippines , the largest university in the country in terms of student population . 
 The Division of the City Schools of Manila , a branch of the Department of Education , refers to the city 's three @-@ tier public education system . It governs the 71 public elementary schools , 32 public high schools . 
 The city also contains the Manila Science High School , the pilot science high school of the Philippines ; the National Museum , where the <unk> of Juan <unk> is housed ; the Metropolitan Museum of Manila , a museum of modern and contemporary visual arts ; the <unk> <unk> , the Children 's Museum , a place of hands @-@ on discovery and fun learning ; and , the National Library , the <unk> of the country 's printed and recorded cultural heritage and other literary and information resources . 
 <unk> is a large genus of <unk> native to Mexico , the Caribbean , Central and South America . This <unk> <unk> , non @-@ spiny genus includes both small <unk> lacking an <unk> stem and large trees . The genus has a complicated taxonomic history , and has often been split into four or five genera based on differences in the male flowers . Since the genera can only be distinguished on the basis of their male flowers , the existence of intermediate flower types and the existence of hybrids between different genera has been used as an argument for keeping them all in the same genus . This has been supported by a recent molecular phylogeny . 
 Somewhere between 29 and 67 species are recognised in the genus , with estimates of as many as 100 . <unk> <unk> collections make it difficult to determine whether certain groups represent single species , or groups of similar species . <unk> species have a long history of human use , and include economically important sources of palm oil and fibre . Many species are fire tolerant and thrive in disturbed habitats . Their seeds are animal dispersed , including some which are thought to have been adapted for dispersal by now @-@ extinct Pleistocene <unk> . 
 The genus <unk> has <unk> compound leaves — rows of leaflets emerge on either side of the axis of the leaf in a feather @-@ like or <unk> @-@ like pattern . Species are also non @-@ spiny <unk> and includes both large trees with stout stems up to 30 metres ( 98 ft ) tall and <unk> <unk> ( one which lack an <unk> stem ) . The number of leaves per individual varies from about three to thirty @-@ five ; larger plants tend to have more and longer leaves . 
 <unk> are large , branched and borne among the leaves . The <unk> consists of a main axis — the <unk> and the <unk> — and a series of smaller branches , the <unk> . The <unk> , which bear the flowers , emerge from the <unk> . The <unk> is the main stalk , connecting the <unk> with the stem . <unk> either consist entirely of male flowers , or are predominantly female with a few male flowers . Fruit usually have two or three seeds , although fewer or more are present in some species , and are usually brown , yellow , orange @-@ brown or purple when mature . 
 <unk> species are <unk> — male and female flowers are separate , but are borne by the same plant . Various species have been described as being insect @-@ <unk> , including A. <unk> , while <unk> in A. <unk> and A. <unk> , has been attributed both to insects and wind . 
 <unk> <unk> is remote tubular — during <unk> , as the <unk> expands it pushes the young shoot away from the seed . After <unk> , the stem initially grows downward before turning to grow upward and produce the <unk> stem . This produces a " saxophone shaped " <unk> portion of the stem . The fact that the shoot tips of <unk> seedlings are underground it likely to contribute to their fire @-@ tolerance . 
 Species range across the <unk> from Mexico in the north to Bolivia , Paraguay , and southern Brazil in the south . According to <unk> and <unk> , three species are found in Mexico , four in Central America , and 62 in South America . Three species are present in the Caribbean — two in Trinidad and <unk> , along the southern edge of the region , and one in Haiti . 
 <unk> includes both large trees and small <unk> <unk> which occupy a number of different ecological niches . <unk> stands of some of the larger species are conspicuous elements on the landscape , while smaller species are found in both in the forest <unk> and in <unk> . 
 The Heart of Ezra Greer is a 1917 American silent drama film produced by the Thanhouser Company and directed by Emile <unk> . The film focuses on Ezra Greer , a successful middle @-@ aged man who searches for his college age daughter , Mary . The <unk> Mary was <unk> and abandoned by Jack <unk> , later bearing his child .

The film was released by <unk> on October 7 , 1917 . The film was the final release from Thanhouser and was deemed to be an average film by most reviewers . Criticism for the film <unk> on far @-@ <unk> coincidences to drive the plot . The film is presumed lost . 
 The film follows Ezra Greer , a middle @-@ aged man who has worked hard since his youth . He cares deeply for his <unk> daughter , Mary , but was unable to attend the annual commencement at her co @-@ educational college . He awaits for her to return from college , but Mary leaves with her romantic interest , Jack <unk> . On promise of marriage and wealth , Mary is <unk> and gives birth to a <unk> child .

 The film was the final production and release of the Thanhouser Company and it was to be released through <unk> . Numerous factors would play into the winding down and eventual closing of the Thanhouser Film Corporation with much advance notice by Edwin Thanhouser . Q. David Bowers writes that it was easy to understand Thanhouser 's decision to retire due to numerous aspects including that releases through <unk> were based on their decision to release or <unk> the work , the New Rochelle studio was 2 @,@ 500 miles from the center of the trade activity and the slump in industry tied to World War I. Weeks before the film was released , Variety told of the winding down of the Thanhouser with the studio 's staff consisting of Edwin Thanhouser and the <unk> , <unk> B. Bishop . The article concluded with the announcement that Lloyd F. Lonergan , the scenario writer of the company , had retired from the company . As it wound down , the Thanhouser Company was announced to have no <unk> would close with a positive bank balance . Little is known of the production of this final film , but it was directed by Emile <unk> from a scenario written by Lloyd F. Lonergan . The cameraman was Jacques <unk> . 
 The five reel film was released through the <unk> Exchange as a <unk> Gold Rooster Play on October 7 , 1917 . Charles E. Wagner of the <unk> 's Trade Review found it to be a good film with great direction and photography , but was concerned that the stunt in which the baby appeared to be involved in the accident was too real . Wagner stated the film had sufficient action and pathos without sexual <unk> ; which should prove a strong program for the <unk> program . Frances Agnew of The Morning Telegraph found it to be an average picture that was not exceptional for audiences , but it would hold sentimental appeal for the average viewer . A reviewer for the The New York Dramatic Mirror found the film 's excessive use of <unk> meetings to be highly <unk> , but found <unk> 's performance to be excellent and the rest of the cast give good performances . The reviewer said that Emile <unk> had made the <unk> story more plausible . 
 Like many American films of the time , The Heart of Ezra Greer was subject to cuts by city and state film censorship boards . The Chicago Board of <unk> required the cutting in <unk> 2 of a letter stating , " I cannot face my father , " etc . , and two <unk> of gambling scenes ; and in <unk> 5 a change of the <unk> " Because it means her whole future " to " Because she is his wife " . 
 Free Derry ( Irish : <unk> <unk> ) was a self @-@ declared autonomous nationalist area of Derry , Northern Ireland , that existed between 1969 and 1972 . Its name was taken from a sign painted on a gable wall in the <unk> in January 1969 which read , " You are now entering Free Derry " . The area , which included the <unk> and <unk> neighbourhoods , was secured by community activists for the first time on 5 January 1969 following an incursion into the <unk> by members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary ( <unk> ) . Residents built barricades and carried clubs and similar arms to prevent the <unk> from entering . After six days the residents took down the barricades and <unk> patrols resumed , but tensions remained high over the following months . 
 Violence reached a peak on 12 August 1969 , culminating in the Battle of the <unk> — a three @-@ day pitched battle between residents and the <unk> . On 14 August units of the British Army were deployed at the edge of the <unk> and the <unk> were withdrawn . The Derry Citizens Defence Association ( <unk> ) declared their intention to hold the area against both the <unk> and the British Army until their demands were met . The British Army made no attempt to enter the area . The situation continued until October 1969 when , following publication of the Hunt Report , military police were allowed in . 
 The Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) began to re @-@ arm and recruit after August 1969 . In December 1969 it split into the Official IRA and the Provisional IRA . Both were supported by the people of the Free Derry area . Meanwhile , relations between the British Army and the nationalist community , which were initially good , deteriorated . In July 1971 there was a surge of recruitment into the IRA after two young men were shot and killed by British troops . The government introduced <unk> on 9 August 1971 , and in response , barricades went up once more in the <unk> and <unk> . This time , Free Derry was a no @-@ go area , defended by armed members of both the Official and Provisional IRA . From within the area they launched attacks on the British Army , and the <unk> began a bombing campaign in the city centre . As before , unarmed ' <unk> ' manned the barricades , and crime was dealt with by a voluntary body known as the Free Derry Police . 
 Support for the IRA increased further after Bloody Sunday in January 1972 , when thirteen unarmed men and boys were shot dead by the British Army 's Parachute Regiment at a march in the <unk> ( a 14th man was wounded and died 4 ½ months later ) . The support began to <unk> after the killing by the Official IRA of a local youth who was home on leave from the British Army . After a Provisional IRA ceasefire , during which it entered talks with the British government , broke down , the British took the decision to move against the " no @-@ go " areas . Free Derry came to an end on 31 July 1972 , when thousands of British troops moved in with armoured cars and <unk> to occupy the area . 
 The following day , several thousand residents , led by the <unk> , withdrew to the <unk> and issued an ultimatum to the <unk> — withdraw within two hours or be driven out . With fifteen minutes of the two hours remaining , the police marched out through the <unk> 's Gate , even as the residents were entering from the far side . The barricades were not maintained on this occasion , and routine patrols were not prevented . 
 Samuel <unk> suffered a heart attack four days after his beating . On 17 July he suffered a further heart attack and died . Thousands attended his funeral , and the mood was sufficiently angry that it was clear the annual <unk> Boys ' parade , scheduled for 12 August , could not take place without causing serious disturbance . 
 Following <unk> 's visit , some barricades were breached , but the majority remained while the people awaited concrete evidence of reform . Still the army made no move to enter the area . Law and order was maintained by a ' peace corps ' — volunteers organised by the <unk> to patrol the streets and man the barricades . There was very little crime . <unk> , in the words of <unk> <unk> , " as often as not consisted of a stern lecture from <unk> <unk> on the need for solidarity within the area . " In September the barricades were replaced with a white line painted on the road . 
 The events of August 1969 in Derry , and more particularly in Belfast where the IRA was unable to prevent loss of life or protect families burned out of their homes , brought to a head the divisions that had already appeared within the movement between the radicals and the <unk> , and led to a split in December 1969 into the Official IRA and the Provisional IRA . Initially , both armies organised for defensive purposes only , although the <unk> were planning towards an offensive campaign . In Derry there was far less hostility between the two organisations than elsewhere and <unk> commonly paid subscriptions to both . When <unk> were arrested after the Official 's Easter parade in March 1970 , Officials and <unk> <unk> their trial together . At the start the Officials attracted most of the younger members . Martin McGuinness , who in August 1969 had helped defend the barricades , initially joined the Officials , but a few months later left to join the <unk> . 
 Two men , <unk> <unk> and Desmond Beattie , were shot dead in separate incidents in the early morning and afternoon of 8 July 1971 . They were the first people to be killed by the British Army in Derry . In both cases the British Army claimed that the men were attacking them with guns or bombs , while <unk> insisted that both were unarmed . The Social Democratic and Labour Party ( <unk> ) , the newly formed party of which John Hume and Ivan Cooper were leading members , withdrew from <unk> in protest , but among residents there was a perception that moderate policies had failed . The result was a surge of support for the IRA . The <unk> held a meeting the following Sunday at which they called on people to " join the IRA " . Following the meeting , people <unk> up to join , and there was large @-@ scale rioting . The British Army post at <unk> 's Lane came under sustained attack , and troops there and around the city came under fire from the IRA . 
 The increasing violence in Derry and elsewhere led to increasing speculation that <unk> without trial would be introduced in Northern Ireland , and on 9 August 1971 hundreds of <unk> and nationalists were arrested in dawn raids . In Derry , residents came out onto the streets to resist the arrests , and fewer people were taken there than elsewhere ; nevertheless leading figures including <unk> <unk> and <unk> White were interned . In response , barricades were erected once again and the third Free Derry came into existence . Unlike its predecessors , this Free Derry was marked by a strong IRA presence , both Official and Provisional . It was defended by armed <unk> — a no @-@ go area , one in which British security forces were unable to operate . 
 Gun attacks on the British Army increased . Six soldiers were wounded in the first day after <unk> , and shortly afterwards a soldier was killed — the first to be killed by either IRA in Derry . The army moved in in force on 18 August to <unk> the barricades . A gun battle ensued in which a young Provisional IRA officer , <unk> <unk> , was killed . A crowd staging a sit @-@ down protest was <unk> down and the protesters , including John Hume and Ivan Cooper , arrested . With barricades re @-@ appearing as quickly as they were removed , the army eventually abandoned their attempt . 
 The Derry <unk> had little contact with the IRA elsewhere . They had few weapons ( about twenty ) which they used mainly for sniping . At the same time , they launched their bombing campaign in Derry . Unlike in Belfast , they were careful to avoid killing or injuring innocent people . <unk> <unk> wrote that " the Derry <unk> , under Martin McGuinness , had managed to bomb the city centre until it looked as if it had been hit from the air without causing any civilian casualties . " 
 Although both <unk> operated openly , neither was in control of Free Derry . The barricades were manned by unarmed ' <unk> ' . Crime was dealt with by a volunteer force called the Free Derry Police , which was headed by Tony O <unk> , a Derry footballer and Northern Ireland International . 
 Both the Provisional and Official IRA stepped up attacks after Bloody Sunday , with the tacit support of the residents . Local feelings changed , however , with the killing of Ranger William Best by the Official IRA . Best was a 19 @-@ year @-@ old local man who was home on leave from the British Army at his parents ' house in the <unk> . He was abducted , interrogated and shot . The following day 500 women marched to the Republican Club offices in protest . Nine days later , on 29 May , the Official IRA declared a ceasefire . The Provisional IRA initially stated that they would not follow suit , but after informal approaches to the British Government they announced a ceasefire from 26 June . Martin McGuinness was the Derry representative in a party of senior <unk> who travelled to London for talks with William <unk> , the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland . The talks were not resumed after the ending of the truce following a violent confrontation in Belfast when troops prevented Catholic families from taking over houses in the <unk> estate . 
 Political pressure for the action against the " no @-@ go " areas increased after the events of Bloody Friday in Belfast . A British Army attack was considered inevitable , and the IRA took the decision not to resist it . On 31 July 1972 , Operation <unk> was launched when thousands of British troops , equipped with armoured cars and armoured <unk> ( AVREs ) , dismantled the barricades and occupied the area . 
 After Operation <unk> , the British Army controlled the <unk> and <unk> by <unk> large numbers of troops within the area , by conducting large @-@ scale ' search ' operations that were in fact undertaken for purposes of intelligence gathering , and by setting up over a dozen covert observation posts . Over the following years IRA violence in the city was contained to the point where it was possible to believe ' the war was over ' in the area , although there were still frequent street riots . Nationalists — even those who did not support the IRA — remained <unk> opposed to the army and to the state . 
 Many of the residents ' original grievances were addressed with the passing of the Local Government ( Northern Ireland ) Act , 1972 , which <unk> the electoral boundaries and introduced universal adult suffrage based on the single <unk> vote . <unk> were held in May 1973 . Nationalists gained a majority on the council for the first time since 1923 . Since then the area has been extensively redeveloped , with modern housing replacing the old houses and flats . The Free Derry era is commemorated by the Free Derry wall , the murals of the <unk> Artists and the Museum of Free Derry .

The appearance of this delegation marked the tenth appearance of Chad at the Summer Olympics , the first been in 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo , Japan , and its seventh appearance since its Olympic hiatus between 1976 and 1980 . Both <unk> and <unk> ranked seventh in their respective <unk> and did not advance past the qualification round . As of the end of the 2012 London Olympics , there have been no <unk> from Chad . 
 Chad is a <unk> country in Africa whose northern region lies within the eastern reaches of the <unk> Desert and whose southern region lies within the eastern portion of the <unk> . It borders Libya to the south , <unk> to the east , Sudan to the west , and the Central African Republic to the north .

 View of the World from 9th Avenue ( sometimes A <unk> New Yorker 's View of the World , A New Yorker 's View of the World or simply View of the World ) is a 1976 illustration by Saul <unk> that served as the cover of the March 29 , 1976 , edition of The New Yorker . The work presents the view from Manhattan of the rest of the world showing Manhattan as the center of the world . 
 View of the World has been parodied by Ted <unk> , Columbia Pictures , The New Yorker , The Economist and Mad Magazine , among others . The work has been imitated and printed without authorization in a variety of ways . The Columbia parody led to a ruling by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in <unk> v. Columbia Pictures Industries , Inc. in favor of <unk> because of copyright violations by Columbia Pictures . The work is regarded as one of the greatest magazine covers of recent generations and is studied by art students around the world . 
 Saul <unk> created 85 covers and <unk> internal drawings and illustrations for The New Yorker , including its March 29 , 1976 cover , titled " View of the World from 9th Avenue " . This is regarded as his most famous work . It is considered an example of unintentional fame : <unk> has noted that the type of fame that resulted from the work has diminished his significance to " the man who did that poster " . The work is sometimes referred to as A <unk> New Yorker 's View of the World or A New Yorker 's View of the World because it depicts a map of the world as seen by self @-@ absorbed New Yorkers . At one point The New Yorker applied for a copyright from the United States <unk> Office for the work . It assigned the copyright to <unk> and subsequently reproduced posters of the painting . 
 The illustration is split in two parts , with the bottom half of the image showing Manhattan 's 9th Avenue , 10th Avenue , and the Hudson River ( appropriately labeled ) , and the top half depicting the rest of the world . It is a westward view over 10th Avenue . The rest of the United States is the size of the three New York City blocks and is drawn as a <unk> bounded by North American neighbors Canada and Mexico , with a thin brown strip along the Hudson representing " Jersey " , the names of five cities ( Los Angeles ; Washington , D.C. ; Las Vegas ; Kansas City ; and Chicago ) and three states ( Texas , Utah , and Nebraska ) scattered among a few rocks for the United States beyond New Jersey , which is in bolder font than the rest of the country beyond the Hudson . Washington , D.C. is depicted as a remote location near Mexico . The Pacific Ocean , slightly wider than the Hudson , separates the United States from three flattened land masses labeled China , Japan and Russia . Notably , the image depicts the world with a back turned to Europe , which is absent from the painting . 
 The work is composed in ink , pencil , colored pencil , and <unk> on paper and measures 28 by 19 inches ( 71 cm × 48 cm ) . When exhibiting this work along with alternate versions and sketches , the University of Pennsylvania summarized the work as a " bird 's @-@ eye view of the city from <unk> Avenue in a straight line westward , with space becoming ever more <unk> ... " They also described the work as a tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek view of the world . New York interpreted the New York @-@ centric mind 's view of the rest of the world as a set of outer <unk> as iconic . National Post journalist Robert <unk> described the perspective as one in which the entire world is a suburb of Manhattan . 
 View of the World has been imitated without authorization in a variety of ways . The work has been imitated in <unk> format by numerous municipalities , states and nations . <unk> had stated that he could have retired on royalties from the many parodies made of the painting , had they been paid , a motivation for his eventual copyright lawsuit for the Moscow on the Hudson use . <unk> , writing in The National Post , noted that the metaphor of the world as a suburb of Manhattan was " understood and borrowed " by the whole world . Local artists , especially poster artists , presented similarly compelling depictions of their own provincial perceptions . <unk> demonstrated the prominence of this work by mentioning that a high school in suburban Ottawa made imitating View of the World an assignment in its graphic arts class . He also noted that the results of this assignment was a worldwide variety of global <unk> from which the students viewed the world . 
 The illustration — <unk> depicting New Yorkers ' self @-@ image of their place in the world , or perhaps outsiders ' view of New Yorkers ' self @-@ image — inspired many similar works , including the poster for the 1984 film Moscow on the Hudson ; that movie poster led to a lawsuit , <unk> v. Columbia Pictures Industries , Inc . , <unk> F. <unk> . <unk> ( <unk> 1987 ) , which held that Columbia Pictures violated the copyright <unk> held on his work . 
 On June 5 , 2003 , during the first term of George W. Bush 's presidency , Ted <unk> presented A View of the World from Pennsylvania Avenue as a <unk> of View of the World from 9th Avenue in a Universal Press Syndicate editorial cartoon .

 The cover was later <unk> by Barry Blitt for the cover of The New Yorker on October 6 , 2008 . The cover featured Sarah Palin looking out of her window seeing only Alaska , with Russia in the far background . 
 The March 21 , 2009 The Economist included a story entitled " How China sees the World " that presents a parody that is also an homage to the original image , but depicting the viewpoint from Beijing 's Chang 'an Avenue instead of Manhattan . A caption above the illustration reads " <unk> by Jon Berkeley ( with <unk> to <unk> and The New Yorker ) " . It accompanied an article that discussed the burgeoning Chinese economy at the time of the contemporary financial crisis . 
 The October 1 , 2012 cover of Mad Magazine <unk> the problems with the September release of Apple Inc . ' s iOS 6 mobile operating system which included Apple Maps , a replacement for Google Maps . The work presents what View of the World might look like if one had relied upon the September 2012 version of Apple Maps to locate various landmarks . 
 On October 17 , 2005 , American Society of Magazine Editors unveiled its list of the top 40 magazine covers of the prior 40 years and ranked View of the World from 9th Avenue in fourth place . The listing stated that the work " ... has come to represent Manhattan 's <unk> perception of the country beyond the Hudson River . The cartoon showed the supposed limited mental geography of <unk> .

 Temple Beth Israel ( Hebrew : <unk> <unk> ) is a <unk> synagogue located at 1175 East 29th Avenue in Eugene , Oregon . Founded in the early 1930s as a Conservative congregation , Beth Israel was for many decades the only synagogue in Eugene . 
 The congregation initially worshipped in a converted house on West Eighth Street . It constructed its first building on Portland Street in 1952 , and occupied its current <unk> @-@ <unk> facilities in 2008 . 
 In the early 1990s conflict between feminist and traditional members led to the latter leaving Beth Israel , and forming the Orthodox Congregation <unk> Torah . Beth Israel came under attack from neo @-@ Nazi members of the <unk> twice , in 1994 and again in 2002 . In both cases the <unk> were caught and convicted . 
 Small numbers of German Jews began settling in Eugene in the late 19th century , but most moved on . In the early 20th century the first Eastern European Jews settled there , and by the 1920s Eugene 's Jewish community began gathering prayer <unk> for holding Friday night and Jewish holiday services in individuals ' homes . Historian Steven Lowenstein writes that " [ a ] <unk> <unk> <unk> 's death in 1933 , his home at 231 West Eighth Street was remodeled and named Temple Beth Israel " . It was a traditional Conservative synagogue , and from that time until the 1990s it was the only synagogue in Eugene . 
 In 1952 , the congregation constructed a one @-@ story synagogue building on an almost 1 acre ( 0 @.@ 40 ha ) property at <unk> Portland Street . Designed by architect and Holocaust @-@ survivor Heinrich <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> , the building featured an interior courtyard that provided natural lighting , and " a network of ceiling beams painted with symbols and shapes " by <unk> . 
 Temple Beth Israel 's services and religious functions were lay @-@ led for decades . Its first rabbi was Marcus Simmons . Originally from England , he was a graduate of University of London and Oxford University , and was ordained at the Hebrew <unk> <unk> . He emigrated to the United States in 1957 , and joined Beth Israel in 1959 . The members were not , however , agreed that a full @-@ time rabbi was required , and in 1961 , he accepted a <unk> position in <unk> , California . 
 Following a hiatus of two years , Louis <unk> was hired as rabbi in 1963 . Born in New York City in 1912 to immigrant parents , he was a graduate of City University of New York and was ordained at the Jewish Institute of New York . He had previously worked for the United Jewish Appeal , and from 1959 to 1963 was the first <unk> rabbi at Syracuse University . There was some concern about <unk> 's hiring , as he had a police record as a result of his involvement in freedom marches in the African @-@ American Civil Rights Movement ( 1955 – 1968 ) . He served until his death in 1976 . 
 <unk> <unk> was hired as rabbi in 1977 . <unk> in Reform Judaism , he had previously served as a rabbi in <unk> , Kansas for two years , then lived in Israel for two years , before coming to Eugene . <unk> was known for his support for minority rights and gay rights , anti @-@ nuclear and anti @-@ war activism , support of reconciliation between Israel and the Palestinians , and outreach to non @-@ <unk> members of Eugene 's Jewish community . 
 <unk> attempted to revive the Biblical concept of the " <unk> <unk> " in his approach to <unk> . He was willing to <unk> at an <unk> if the non @-@ Jewish partner , after discussions with the rabbi , agreed of his or her own free will to fulfill a set of commitments , including " a commitment to a Jewish home life , participation in Jewish life and tradition , and raising future children as Jews " . The non @-@ Jewish partner making this commitment became a " <unk> <unk> " , or " non @-@ Jewish member of the Jewish people " . 
 <unk> 's wife Alice was a strong feminist , and during the 1980s he and his wife supported a number of changes to the <unk> and ritual . These included allowing women to read from the Torah and lead the prayers , and changing prayers to be more gender inclusive - for example , using gender @-@ neutral terms and <unk> for God , and adding references to the Biblical <unk> in prayers like the <unk> , which traditionally only mentioned the Biblical <unk> . While most congregation members approved of these changes , a minority resisted them . 
 By the early 1990s serious divisions developed among the members of the congregation over a number of issues , including personal <unk> , the rabbi 's activism and " advocacy of ' ultra @-@ liberal ' causes " , political differences over the Israeli – Palestinian conflict , and 
 a myriad of additional Jewish cultural / religious issues , such as the acceptance of <unk> couples , adherence to <unk> dietary laws , the use of modern language and music during worship services , <unk> of certain prayers such as the <unk> to make them less <unk> , and so on . 
 However , the biggest source of division , which <unk> all others , was " the roles and rights of men and women in the synagogue . " 
 In the early 1990s a group of newly <unk> members began holding more traditional services in a back room of the synagogue , complete with a <unk> , a partition separating men and women . The " more feminist @-@ minded " members strongly objected to having a <unk> anywhere in the Temple Beth Israel building , even if it were not in the services they attended . The latter group eventually circulated a petition which stated that either the <unk> would have to be taken down , or those members who wanted it would have to leave . <unk> also signed the petition . Faced with this opposition , in 1992 the Orthodox members left , renting new premises and hiring their own rabbi , creating Eugene 's second synagogue , originally called " The <unk> <unk> " , and in 1998 renamed " Congregation <unk> Torah " . 
 <unk> held himself responsible , and the schism led to his " <unk> of the needs of Temple Beth Israel and his role as a rabbi " . As a result , he left Beth Israel in 1994 to lead a synagogue on Long Island . During his tenure at Beth Israel , membership rose from 118 to 350 families . <unk> died two years later at age 51 . 
 The congregation decided to leave the Conservative movement in 1995 , and for a year had no affiliation . In late 1996 , after considering both Reform and <unk> as <unk> , the congregation affiliated with the <unk> movement . By 1999 , membership had grown to around 370 families . 
 <unk> @-@ <unk> was instrumental in developing the concept of " <unk> <unk> " , the idea that one should only purchase goods that are produced in an ethical way . His essay , " <unk> <unk> , " was selected for publication in Arthur <unk> 's Best Jewish Writing 2003 . A singer , cello and guitar player , he <unk> and performs Jewish music . 
 On March 20 , 1994 , Chris Lord , an individual associated with the <unk> and American Front , fired ten rounds with an assault rifle into the temple , damaging the interior . The attacks were prompted by a newspaper article about several members of Eugene 's Jewish community , including a lesbian . Community organizations , including a local gay rights group , responded by standing vigil outside the synagogue during <unk> services . Lord and an associate were caught and convicted , and Lord was sentenced to four and a half years in prison . 
 On October 25 , 2002 Jacob <unk> , his brother Gabriel <unk> , Gerald <unk> , Jesse Baker , and one other man , all members of the <unk> , drove to Beth Israel with the intent of intimidating the <unk> . While a service with 80 members attending was taking place , the men threw rocks etched with Nazi <unk> through the synagogue 's stained glass windows , then <unk> off . The men were caught , pleaded guilty , and were convicted . They served sentences ranging from a 6 @-@ month work release term and five years <unk> , to eleven years and three months in federal prison for the <unk> , Jacob <unk> . 
 Originally sized for 75 families , Temple Beth Israel 's Portland Street building had been renovated and enlarged over the years to 7 @,@ 500 square feet ( 700 m2 ) to accommodate 250 families and 150 students . Despite these additions and the loss of members to Congregation <unk> Torah , the synagogue was not large enough , particularly during the High <unk> , when extra space had to be rented . In 1997 the congregation purchased the property of the University Street Christian Church for $ 500 @,@ 000 ( today $ 740 @,@ 000 ) , and began planning for a new facility . The members considered renovating the existing building on the property , but felt a new building would better suit their requirements , and razed the church . 
 In 2003 the congregation got a permit to begin construction of a new facility on the now @-@ vacant 1 @.@ 37 @-@ acre ( 0 @.@ 55 ha ) plot of land at the northwest corner of East 29th Avenue and University Street . An initial capital campaign raised more than $ 1 @.@ 8 million , which fully paid for the land , and by August 2007 an additional $ 1 @.@ 7 million had been raised towards anticipated overall project costs of $ 5 million . 
 The environmentally sensitive building was designed by <unk> Solomon and Associates of Kansas City and local company <unk> Architects & <unk> , and built by <unk> Commercial Construction of Eugene . The building used " energy efficient heating , ventilation and lighting " : specific design issues with the building 's energy efficiency included the fact that the largest room in the building , the sanctuary , was also the least @-@ used , and , in accord with Jewish tradition , had to face east ( towards Jerusalem ) . 
 On June 8 , 2008 the congregation dedicated its new building at 1175 East 29th Avenue .

 New York State Route 93 ( NY 93 ) is a 43 @.@ 08 @-@ mile ( 69 @.@ 33 km ) state highway in western New York in the United States . The route begins at an intersection with NY <unk> in the village of <unk> and runs in a general northwest – southeast direction across Niagara and Erie counties to its east end at an intersection with NY 5 in the town of Newstead , just south of the village of <unk> . NY 93 serves as a connector between several major <unk> , including NY 104 in <unk> , NY 31 just west of the city of <unk> , and NY 78 south of the city . 
 NY 93 begins at an intersection with NY <unk> ( Main Street ; co @-@ designated but not signed as County Route 907 or CR 907 ) in the center of the village of <unk> . The route proceeds eastward through the village as a two @-@ lane road named <unk> Street , serving two blocks of commercial areas before <unk> to the northeast and passing into the residential eastern portion of <unk> . At the eastern village limits , NY 93 briefly <unk> to four lanes as it enters a partial cloverleaf interchange with the Niagara Scenic Parkway . Past the junction , the highway <unk> to a two @-@ lane road and changes names to <unk> – <unk> Road as it runs across the town of Porter . The residential surroundings continue to the hamlet of Towers Corners , where NY 93 connects to NY 18 ( Creek Road ) . 
 After NY 18 , NY 93 curves to the southeast , serving another residential stretch ahead of a junction with <unk> – Wilson Road ( CR 36 ) on the eastern edge of Towers Corners . After this intersection , the homes give way to farms as the road heads into rural areas of the town . The route continues on a southeast track through Porter , passing a mixture of rural and residential areas on its way into the hamlet of Porter Center , where NY 93 enters an intersection with Porter Center Road ( CR 57 ) . Another southeastward stretch brings the route across <unk> Creek and into the hamlet of <unk> , where NY 93 becomes the community 's main street . Through <unk> , NY 93 retains the <unk> – <unk> Road name , intersecting with <unk> Road ( CR 17 ) in the hamlet 's business district . 
 Just outside <unk> , NY 93 leaves the town of Porter for the town of Wilson . It continues generally southeastward across mostly open terrain , meeting Randall Road ( CR 83 ) and Church Street ( CR 56 ) on its way to the town of <unk> . NY 93 becomes North Ridge Road at the town line , and it soon enters the hamlet of North Ridge , a community built up around the route 's intersection with NY 425 ( <unk> – Wilson Road ) . The hamlet 's residential surroundings continue to the adjacent community of <unk> Corners , where NY 93 becomes concurrent with NY 104 ( Ridge Road ) . NY 93 and NY 104 proceed northeast across lightly populated areas for 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) to the hamlet of Warren Corners , at which point NY 93 splits from NY 104 and heads southward along Town Line Road . It immediately intersects with Stone Road ( CR 19 ) before leaving the hamlet . 
 Outside of Warren Corners , the route heads across rural areas along the <unk> – <unk> town line . It soon enters the small hamlet of <unk> Corners , where the road passes under Lower Mountain Road ( CR <unk> ) . <unk> to the highway is made by way of Town Line Road Spur ( CR 114 ) , a connector leading to Lower Mountain Road . NY 93 continues southward along the town line , changing names to Junction Road at an intersection with Upper Mountain Road ( CR 5 ) west of the city of <unk> . From here , the route crosses over <unk> Transportation 's <unk> <unk> rail line at the hamlet of <unk> Junction before intersecting with NY 31 ( Saunders Settlement Road ) and NY 270 ( Campbell Boulevard ) just south of the community . NY 270 begins straight ahead to the south while NY 93 turns northeast onto Saunders Settlement Road , beginning a concurrency with NY 31 . 
 Now fully in the town of <unk> , NY 31 and NY 93 proceed northeast through an open area of the town as a four @-@ lane divided highway . The two routes continue to the western edge of the city of <unk> , where they intersect with Upper Mountain Road and the <unk> Bypass . The overlap ends here as NY 93 turns southeastward onto the two @-@ lane bypass . Along the bypass , NY 93 briefly enters the city limits as it runs past several industrial facilities and intersects with <unk> Road ( CR 903 ) just ahead of a bridge over the Erie Canal . Past the waterway , the bypass takes a more <unk> course through an undeveloped part of the town of <unk> to a junction with Robinson Road ( CR 123 ) on the <unk> – <unk> town line . The <unk> Bypass ends here , leaving NY 93 to turn eastward onto Robinson Road . 
 The route initially serves a line of homes as it heads along Robinson Road ; however , it soon enters a commercial district surrounding the road 's intersection with NY 78 ( Transit Road ) . At this point , the <unk> – <unk> town line turns south to follow NY 78 , leaving NY 93 fully within the town of <unk> as it runs eastward past another stretch of homes . Not far from NY 78 , NY 93 changes names to <unk> Road at an intersection with Beattie Avenue ( CR 14 ) and Raymond Road ( CR 85 ) . The junction also marks a shift in the road 's surroundings as the homes give way to open , rolling terrain . NY 93 continues eastward for several miles to the town of <unk> , where it meets <unk> Road ( CR 35 ) and <unk> Road ( CR 142 ) at adjacent intersections just east of the town line . 
 NY 93 takes over <unk> Road 's name and right @-@ of @-@ way , continuing eastward past a line of scattered homes to reach the sparsely developed hamlet of <unk> . Here , the route turns southward at a junction with Bunker Hill Road ( CR 136 ) . Outside of <unk> , NY 93 heads southeastward across undeveloped areas of <unk> , connecting to Block Church Road ( CR 110 ) as it approaches <unk> Creek and the Niagara – Erie county line . The road runs along the northern edge of the creek for about 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) prior to curving southward at an intersection with <unk> Road ( CR 122 ) . The turn brings NY 93 across <unk> Creek and into the Erie County town of Newstead , where it becomes known as Maple Road and immediately intersects with CR 260 ( <unk> Road ) . 
 Continuing southward , NY 93 runs across open , rolling terrain , meeting CR 259 ( <unk> Creek Road ) on its way to the hamlet of <unk> Mills . Here , the rural surroundings briefly give way to residential areas as NY 93 intersects with CR 255 ( Swift Mills Road ) in the center of the community . South of <unk> Mills , the road serves only intermittent stretches of homes for 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) , including a cluster of residences around its closely spaced intersections with CR 253 ( <unk> Road ) and CR 42 ( Rapids Road ) . It continues on a southward track past the eastern terminus of CR 218 ( <unk> Corner – <unk> Road ) to the outskirts of the village of <unk> , where the highway turns east onto Lewis Road and soon enters the village limits . NY 93 runs past a line of homes before intersecting Cedar Street , a road maintained by Erie County as CR 261 north of the village . 
 The route turns south at Cedar Street , following the residential street into downtown <unk> . Here , NY 93 intersects with CR <unk> ( John Street ) at a junction that was once the western terminus of NY 267 . At this intersection , NY 93 heads west on John Street for one block before continuing south on Buffalo Street for another block to Main Street . NY 93 turns westward again , following Main Street through the westernmost part of <unk> 's central business district prior to curving southwestward at a junction with <unk> Street . The highway takes on the <unk> Street name as it crosses over Murder Creek and leaves downtown <unk> . Just south of the creek , NY 93 changes names to <unk> Street at an intersection with Jackson Street . 
 As the route continues southward through the southern part of <unk> , it serves mostly residential areas , save for an industrial complex at NY 93 's intersection with CR 163 ( Clarence Center Road ) and CR 167 ( <unk> Drive ) . NY 93 exits <unk> a short distance south of the junction , at which point the route heads into another area of open fields while retaining the <unk> Street name . It continues on a southward track for about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) to a <unk> intersection with NY 5 ( Main Road ) , where <unk> Street and NY 93 both come to an end . 
 NY 3 was realigned c . 1932 to follow Saunders Settlement Road between <unk> Road ( NY 425 ) and Upper Mountain Road . The former routing of NY 3 along <unk> , Lower Mountain , Gothic Hill , and Upper Mountain roads was redesignated as NY <unk> even though all of NY 3 's former routing was already part of either NY 425 or NY 93 . The NY <unk> designation was eliminated c . 1935 when NY 3 was truncated eastward to a new western terminus in central New York . In the early 1940s , NY 93 was altered to follow North Ridge Road , U.S. Route 104 ( now NY 104 ) , and Junction Road between North Ridge and Lower Mountain Road . 
 Around the same time that NY 93 was rerouted , NY 270 was also extended northward along Junction Road from NY 31 to US 104 . As a result , NY 93 overlapped NY 270 between Lower Mountain Road and US 104 . The overlap with NY 270 remained in place until c . 1963 when NY 270 was truncated southward to the intersection of Lower Mountain and Junction roads . NY 93 was realigned in the late 1970s to bypass Lower Mountain and Gothic Hill Roads on Junction and Upper Mountain roads , replacing NY 270 along Junction Road . The Lower Mountain Road portion of NY 93 's former routing is now maintained by Niagara County as County Route <unk> ( CR <unk> ) . 
 The <unk> Bypass , a highway bypassing downtown <unk> to the southwest , was opened to traffic on July 26 , 1991 . The highway cost $ 7 @.@ 7 million ( equivalent to $ 13 @.@ 4 million in 2016 ) to construct and extended from the junction of NY 31 and NY 93 west of the city to Robinson Road south of downtown . NY 93 was realigned to follow the new bypass south to Robinson Road , where it turned east and followed Robinson Road ( CR 123 ) and <unk> Road ( CR 133 ) to <unk> Road in <unk> . The portion of <unk> Road ( NY 93 's former routing ) east of the <unk> city limits became NY <unk> , an unsigned reference route . 
 <unk> and maintenance of Robinson Road from the bypass to NY 78 was transferred from Niagara County to the state of New York on September 1 , 1990 , as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government . The portion of NY 93 between NY 78 and <unk> Road became state @-@ maintained on October 1 , 1998 , as part of another swap that also transferred ownership and maintenance of <unk> Road to Niagara County . <unk> Road is now CR 142 . 
 On November 1 , 2005 , the Niagara County Legislature voted on a measure to allow the county to ask the New York State Department of Transportation ( <unk> ) to remove the NY 93 designation from Upper Mountain Road , a county @-@ maintained highway , and <unk> it to Junction Road ( NY 270 ) and Saunders Settlement Road ( NY 31 ) . The <unk> for the change came from a resident of Upper Mountain Road , who demanded that trucks should be removed from the roadway . This part of the agenda was passed . <unk> obliged to the request in 2006 , <unk> NY 93 as proposed and <unk> NY 270 southward to NY 31 .

 Typhoon <unk> , known in the Philippines as Typhoon <unk> , was a typhoon that made landfall in the northern Philippines in late October 2013 . Forming on October 27 near Guam , the storm slowly intensified while moving westward . <unk> developed an eye and became a typhoon before striking Luzon on October 31 . The storm weakened over land , but re @-@ intensified over the South China Sea , reaching peak winds of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) on November 2 off the southeast coast of China . Typhoon <unk> stalled and encountered unfavorable conditions , resulting in quick weakening . By November 3 , it had weakened to tropical storm status , and was no longer being warned on by the next day . In northern Luzon , <unk> damaged 32 @,@ 000 houses , including 3 @,@ 000 that were destroyed , and caused four fatalities . High winds and rainfall left <unk> million ( PHP , $ 6 @.@ 4 million USD ) in damage . 
 While approaching northern Luzon on October 29 , <unk> quickly intensified as the initial eye feature organized into a well @-@ defined eye . Late on October 30 , the JTWC upgraded <unk> to typhoon status , and the next day , both PAGASA and JMA followed suit . On October 31 , <unk> made landfall in northeastern Luzon near Cagayan , and developed a <unk> eyewall while initially moving over land . Land interaction weakened the eye by the time <unk> emerged into the South China Sea late on October 31 . The next day , PAGASA discontinued advisories after the typhoon exited the region . <unk> rebuilt around the center , with continued favorable conditions allowing for <unk> . 
 Late on November 1 , a large eye redeveloped , and the JTWC estimated <unk> attained peak 1 minute sustained winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) . Early the next day , the JMA also estimated the typhoon reached peak 10 minute winds of 140 km / h ( 85 mph ) . Later , increasing wind shear caused the eye to deteriorate , and <unk> began slowing about 260 km ( 160 mi ) east @-@ southeast of Hong Kong after reaching the western edge of the subtropical ridge . After remaining nearly stationary , <unk> began moving steadily to the west @-@ southwest due to a new ridge . The convection continued to weaken due to continued shear and cooler waters from <unk> , and <unk> deteriorated to tropical storm status on November 3 . The next day , the JTWC issued its final advisory after the circulation became exposed from the convection . Also on November 4 , the JMA downgraded <unk> to tropical depression status off the northeast Vietnam coast . The system dissipated at 0000 UTC on November 5 . 
 Before <unk> struck the Philippines , PAGASA issued a number 3 warning signal for portions of northern Luzon , where winds were expected to reach over 100 km / h ( 60 mph ) . The agency noted for the potential for flooding and landslides . High winds knocked down trees across Luzon , and left about 80 % of Cagayan province without power , as well as some areas without internet or <unk> service . <unk> of the Pan @-@ Philippine Highway were blocked , and in Lal @-@ Lo , Cagayan , a car crashed into a gasoline truck due to power outages . Agriculture damage was estimated at <unk> million ( PHP , $ 6 @.@ 3 million USD ) , occurring just before the start of the harvest . Across the island , the typhoon damaged 32 @,@ <unk> houses , including 3 @,@ <unk> that were destroyed , forcing 65 @,@ 648 people to evacuate to storm shelters . Overall , <unk> killed four people in the Philippines , and left <unk> million ( PHP , $ 6 @.@ 4 million USD ) in damage . After the storm , workers quickly restored power lines , while the government provided monetary assistance to storm @-@ ravaged families , after Cagayan was declared a state of <unk> . Members of the Philippine military and Department of Public Works and Highways worked to clean up following the storm . 
 The China National Meteorological Centre issued a " yellow alert " , the second @-@ lowest of the four level warning system , for <unk> due to the threat of the storm . The agency recommended boats to return to port . <unk> in Vietnam also warned for the potential of heavy rainfall due to the dissipating Tropical Depression <unk> , and released water from three dams to prevent overflow . 
 <unk> 's Block Ball is a 1995 action video game , a spin @-@ off from the <unk> series for the Game Boy portable console . It is a <unk> clone ; the player controls <unk> along the screen 's edge to knock a bouncing ball , <unk> , into <unk> bricks . The game 's 55 levels include power @-@ ups , bonus rounds , and minigames . <unk> 's Block Ball was developed by HAL Laboratory and Nintendo R & D1 . The team spent half a year revising the gameplay to match <unk> 's signature characteristics . <unk> 's Block Ball was published by Nintendo first in Japan in 1995 , later in Europe , and last in North America in 1996 . 
 Reviewers considered the game an improvement on the <unk> formula and praised its gameplay craftsmanship and incorporation of the <unk> series . It was included in multiple top Game Boy game lists and was later <unk> on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual <unk> . 
 The player controls <unk> along the screen 's edges to knock a bouncing ball , <unk> , into <unk> bricks . The player loses a life if <unk> hits the edge of the screen . Each of the game 's eleven stages include five rounds of increasingly complex block patterns for <unk> to clear . The ten different block types vary in <unk> and points value . A well @-@ timed hit of the <unk> gives <unk> a powerful bounce to break through harder blocks . Another block type turns the remaining blocks into a bonus round that rewards the player for clearing the screen in the least amount of time . The player can find <unk> stars that lead to minigames , such as air hockey , where the player can earn extra lives . The rounds also include enemies to attack and avoid . Some enemies contain bonus items . Each stage ends in a boss fight . 
 With stone , needle , flame , and spark power @-@ ups , <unk> can transform to interact with blocks differently . For instance , the spark power @-@ up lets <unk> break through otherwise <unk> blocks , and the needle lets <unk> hit spikes once without losing a life . The game has a themed frame and uses a wide palette of colors in @-@ game when played with the Super Game Boy . 
 The game was developed by HAL Laboratory with <unk> Yokoi 's Nintendo R & D1 , and published by Nintendo . At one point in development , HAL decided that the game did not feel like a <unk> game . The team spent six months completely revising the game under explicit instructions on how <unk> should move . <unk> games contain elements of unrestricted , creative movement as a general theme . <unk> 's Block Ball was released for the Game Boy first in Japan in 1995 and later in Europe ( 1995 ) and North America ( May 1996 ) . It was later <unk> on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual <unk> , and released first in Japan ( October 2011 ) and later in Europe ( February 2012 ) and North America ( May 2012 ) . 
 On release , the four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly applauded <unk> 's Block Ball for <unk> the <unk> formula to create a new and enjoyable game . They especially praised the unique power @-@ ups , though <unk> Boyer and <unk> X also felt the game was too short and easy . Nintendo Power said they enjoyed Block Ball and its number of stages , but wondered how its eight <unk> of memory were being used . The magazine found the parts where <unk> eats the <unk> blocks to be innovative . All six of the magazine 's reviewers recommended the game . 
 IGN wrote that the game was primarily remembered as " an <unk> or <unk> clone skinned with the <unk> franchise " . IGN calculated an average reviewer score of 7 @.@ 4 / 10 . The <unk> series became known for its number of non @-@ platformer spin @-@ offs , of which Block Ball was one , like <unk> 's <unk> Land and <unk> 's Dream Course . <unk> 's spherical shape lent itself towards ball @-@ like roles . IGN wrote that Block Ball was the first " truly out there " <unk> spin @-@ off , but that the game was too short . 
 In a retrospective review , <unk> had high praise for the level design , graphics , and animations . They also found the music excellent in comparison to the annoying and repetitive soundtrack of most <unk> <unk> . The magazine also liked how the game fit the <unk> universe , apart from its increased difficulty — <unk> occasionally had trouble hitting the slow @-@ paced ball with precision .

He arrived in France in September 1914 and whilst there was struck by the lack of any official mechanism for documenting or marking the location of graves of those who had been killed and felt compelled to create an organisation within the Red Cross for this purpose . In March 1915 , with the support of <unk> <unk> , <unk> @-@ General of the British Expeditionary Force , Ware 's work was given official recognition and support by the Imperial War Office and the unit was transferred to the British Army as the Graves <unk> Commission . The new Graves <unk> Commission had over 31 @,@ 000 graves of British and Imperial soldiers registered by October 1915 and 50 @,@ 000 registered by May 1916 . 
 When municipal <unk> began to <unk> Ware began negotiations with various local authorities to acquire land for further <unk> . Ware began with an agreement with France to build joint British and French <unk> under the understanding that these would be maintained by the French government . Ware eventually concluded that it was not <unk> to leave the maintenance responsibilities solely to the French government and subsequently arranged for France to purchase the land , grant it in <unk> , and leave the management and maintenance responsibilities to the British . The French government agreed under the condition that <unk> respected certain dimensions , were accessible by public road , were in the vicinity of medical aid stations and were not too close to towns or villages . Similar negotiations were started with the Belgian government . 
 As reports of the grave registration work became public , the Commission began to receive letters of enquiry and requests for photographs of graves from relatives of deceased soldiers . By 1917 , 17 @,@ 000 photographs had been dispatched to relatives . In March 1915 , the Commission , with the support of the Red Cross , began to dispatch photographic prints and cemetery location information in answer to the requests . The Graves <unk> Commission became the Directorate of Graves <unk> and <unk> in the spring of 1916 in recognition of the fact that the scope of work began to extend beyond simple grave registration and began to include responding to <unk> from relatives of those killed . The <unk> 's work was also extended beyond the Western Front and into other theatres of war , with units deployed in Greece , Egypt and Mesopotamia . 
 As the war continued , Ware and others became concerned about the fate of the graves in the post @-@ war period . Following a suggestion by the British Army , the National Committee for the Care of Soldiers ' Graves was appointed by the British government in January 1916 , with Edward , Prince of Wales agreeing to serve as president . The National Committee for the Care of Soldiers ' Graves was created with the intention of taking over the work of the Directorate of Graves <unk> and <unk> after the war . The government felt that it was more appropriate to <unk> the work to a specially appointed body rather than to any existing government department . By early 1917 a number of members of the committee believed a formal imperial organisation would be needed to care for the graves . With the help of Edward , Prince of Wales , Ware submitted a memorandum to the Imperial War Conference in 1917 suggesting that an imperial organisation be constituted . The suggestion was accepted and on 21 May 1917 the Imperial War Graves Commission was established by Royal Charter , with the Prince of Wales serving as president , Secretary of State for War Lord Derby as chairman and Ware as vice @-@ chairman . The Commission 's undertakings began in earnest at the end of the First World War . Once land for <unk> and memorials had been guaranteed , the enormous task of recording the details of the dead could begin . By 1918 , some <unk> @,@ 000 graves had been identified and a further <unk> @,@ 000 casualties were registered as having no known grave . 
 The scale , and associated high number of casualties , of the war produced an entirely new attitude towards the commemoration of war dead . Previous to World War I , individual commemoration of war dead was often on an ad hoc basis and was almost exclusively limited to commissioned officers . However , the war required <unk> of a significant percentage of the population , either as volunteers or through conscription . An expectation had consequently arisen that individual soldiers would expect to be commemorated , even if they were low @-@ ranking members of the military . A committee under <unk> Kenyon , Director of the British Museum , presented a report to the Commission in November 1918 detailing how it envisioned the development of the <unk> . Two key elements of this report were that bodies should not be repatriated and that uniform memorials should be used to avoid class distinctions . Beyond the logistical nightmare of returning home so many corpses , it was felt that repatriation would conflict with the feeling of <unk> that had developed between serving ranks . 
 Three of the most eminent architects of their day , Sir Herbert Baker , Sir Reginald <unk> , and Sir Edwin <unk> were commissioned to design the <unk> and memorials . <unk> Kipling was appointed literary advisor for the language used for memorial inscriptions . 
 At the end of 1919 , the Commission had spent £ 7 @,@ 500 , and this figure rose to £ 250 @,@ 000 in 1920 as construction of <unk> and memorials increased . By 1921 , the Commission had established 1 @,@ 000 <unk> which were ready for <unk> <unk> , and burials . Between 1920 and 1923 , the Commission was shipping 4 @,@ 000 <unk> a week to France . In many cases small <unk> were closed and the graves concentrated in larger ones . By 1927 , when the majority of construction had been completed , over 500 <unk> had been built , with 400 @,@ 000 <unk> , a thousand Crosses of <unk> , and 400 Stones of Remembrance . 
 The Commission had also been mandated to individually commemorate each soldier who had no known grave , which amounted to 315 @,@ 000 in France and Belgium alone . The Commission initially decided to build 12 monuments on which to commemorate the missing ; each memorial being located at the site of an important battle along the Western Front . After resistance from the French committee responsible for the <unk> of memorials on French territory , the Commission revised their plan and reduced the number of memorials , and in some cases built memorials to the missing in existing <unk> rather than as separate structures . 
 The only memorial created by the Commission that was not in the form of a monument or cemetery was the <unk> Institute at <unk> , Egypt — complete with library , and <unk> and pathology departments — as its memorial to men of the Egyptian Labour Corps and Camel Transport Corps . Its erection was agreed with local political pressure . 
 From the start of the Second World War in 1939 , the Commission organised grave registration units and , planning ahead based on the experience gained from the First World War , earmarked land for use as <unk> . When the war began turning in favour of the Allies , the Commission was able to begin restoring its First World War <unk> and memorials . It also began the task of commemorating the 600 @,@ 000 Commonwealth casualties from the Second World War . In 1949 , the Commission completed <unk> Canadian War Cemetery , the first of <unk> new <unk> and 36 new memorials . Eventually , over 350 @,@ 000 new <unk> were erected . Many were made from <unk> Wood stone . The wider scale of World War II , coupled with manpower shortages and unrest in some countries , meant that the construction and restoration programmes took much longer . Following the war , the Commission implemented a five @-@ year <unk> renovation programme . The <unk> neglect was largely addressed by 1950 but there were necessary structural repairs to be made . These , together with the <unk> of maintenance tasks from before the war , took a further 10 years to complete and the programme was not completed until the 1960s . 
 With the increased number of civilian casualties compared with the World War I , Winston Churchill agreed to Ware 's proposal that the Commission also maintain a record of Commonwealth civilian war deaths . A supplemental chapter was added to the Imperial War Graves Commission 's charter on 7 February 1941 , <unk> the organisation to collect and record the names of civilians who died from enemy action during the Second World War , which resulted in the creation of the Civilian War Dead Roll of Honour . The roll eventually contained the names of nearly 67 @,@ 000 civilians . The Commission and the Dean of Westminster reached an agreement that the roll would eventually be placed in Westminster Abbey but not until the roll was complete and hostilities had ended . The Commission handed over the first six volumes to the Dean of Westminster on 21 February 1956 ; the final volume was added to the showcase in 1958 . 
 Following World War II the Commission recognised that the word ' Imperial ' within its name was no longer appropriate . In the spirit of strengthening national and regional feelings the organisation 's name was changed to Commonwealth War Graves Commission in 1960 . 
 More recent conflicts have sometimes made it impossible for the Commission to care for <unk> in a given region or resulted in the destruction of sites altogether . <unk> Indian Cemetery in Germany was <unk> after the end of World War II and until the German <unk> because it was located in an area occupied by Russian forces and was not entirely rebuilt until 2005 . The Six @-@ Day War and War of <unk> resulted in the destruction of Port <unk> Memorial and Aden Memorial , and the death of a Commission <unk> at Suez War Memorial Cemetery . During the Lebanese Civil War two <unk> in Beirut were destroyed and had to be rebuilt . The maintenance of war graves and memorials in Iraq has remained difficult since Iran – Iraq War in the 1980s , with regular maintenance being impractical since after the Gulf War . 
 The Commission has , and continues to , also provide support for war graves outside its traditional mandate . In 1982 , the British Ministry of Defence requested the Commission 's assistance to design and construct <unk> in the Falkland Islands for those killed during the <unk> War . Although these <unk> are not Commonwealth War Graves Commission <unk> , the Commission manages the administrative responsibilities of these <unk> . Since 2005 , the Commission has carried out similar management duties on behalf of the British Ministry of Defence for <unk> and graves of British and Imperial soldiers who died during the Second Boer War . In 2003 , Veterans Affairs Canada employed the Commission to develop an approach to locate grave markers for which the Canadian Minister of Veterans Affairs has responsibility . As of 2011 , the Commission conducts a twelve @-@ year cyclical inspection programme of Canadian veterans ' markers installed at the expense of the Government of Canada . 
 In 2008 , an <unk> excavation discovered mass graves on the edge of <unk> Wood outside of <unk> . Two @-@ hundred and fifty British and Australian bodies were excavated from five mass graves which were interred in the newly constructed <unk> ( <unk> Wood ) Military Cemetery . This was the first new Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery in more than 50 years , the last such <unk> having been built after the Second World War . 
 The Commission is currently responsible for the continued commemoration of 1 @.@ 7 million deceased Commonwealth military service members in 153 countries and approximately 67 @,@ 000 civilians who died as a result of enemy action during World War II . Commonwealth military service members are commemorated by name on either a <unk> , at an identified site of a burial , or on a memorial . As a result , the Commission is currently responsible for the care of war dead at over 23 @,@ 000 separate burial sites and maintenance of more than 200 memorials worldwide . The vast majority of burial sites are pre @-@ existing communal or municipal <unk> and parish <unk> located in the United Kingdom , however the Commission has itself constructed approximately 2 @,@ 500 war <unk> worldwide . The Commission has also constructed or commissioned memorials to commemorate the dead who have no known grave ; the largest of these is the <unk> Memorial . 
 The Commission only commemorates those who have died during the designated war years , while in Commonwealth military service or of causes attributable to service . The applicable periods of consideration are 4 August 1914 to 31 August 1921 for the First World War and 3 September 1939 to 31 December 1947 for the Second World War . The end date for the First World War period is the official end of the war , while for the Second World War the Commission selected a date approximately the same period after <unk> Day as the official end of the First World War was after the 1918 Armistice . 
 <unk> who died as a result of enemy action during the Second World War are commemorated differently from those that died as a result of military service . They are commemorated by name through the Civilian War Dead Roll of Honour located in St George 's Chapel in Westminster Abbey . In addition to its mandated duties , the Commission maintains , under arrangement with applicable governments , over 40 @,@ 000 non @-@ Commonwealth war graves and over 25 @,@ 000 non @-@ war military and civilian graves . 
 As well as the main Principal Architects for France and Belgium ( Baker , <unk> and <unk> ) , there were Principal Architects appointed for other regions as well . Sir Robert <unk> was Principal <unk> for Italy , Macedonia and Egypt , while Sir John James <unk> was Principal <unk> for Palestine and Gallipoli , assisted by Thomas Smith <unk> . The Principal <unk> for Mesopotamia was Edward <unk> Warren . 
 In January 1944 , Edward <unk> was appointed Principal <unk> for the UK . <unk> worked extensively for the Commission for 25 years until 1969 , becoming Chief <unk> and also succeeding Kenyon as Artistic <unk> . Together with <unk> , the other Principal Architects appointed during and after the Second World War were Hubert Worthington , Louis de <unk> , Philip <unk> and Colin St Clair <unk> . 
 Structural design has always played an important part in the Commission 's <unk> . Apart from a few exceptions , due to local geological conditions , the <unk> follow the same design and uniform aesthetic all over the world . This makes the <unk> easily recognisable and distinguishes them from war graves administered by other groups or countries . 
 A typical cemetery is surrounded by a low wall or hedge and with a wrought @-@ iron gate entrance . For <unk> in France and Belgium , a land <unk> near the entrance or along a wall identifies the cemetery grounds as having been provided by the French or Belgian governments . All but the smallest <unk> contain a register with an inventory of the burials , a plan of the plots and rows , and a basic history of the cemetery . The register is located within a metal cupboard that is marked with a cross located in either the wall near the cemetery entrance or in a shelter within the cemetery . More recently , in larger sites , a stainless steel notice gives details of the respective military campaign . The <unk> within the cemetery are of a uniform size and design and mark plots of equal size . 
 The cemetery grounds are , except in drier climates , grass covered with a floral border around the <unk> . There is also an absence of any paving between the <unk> rows which is intended to make the cemetery feel like a traditional walled garden where visitors could experience a sense of peace . However , Carter and Jackson argue that the uniform aesthetics are designed to evoke a positive experience which deliberately masks and <unk> the nature of the war deaths . 
 Typically , <unk> of more than 40 graves contain a Cross of <unk> designed by architect Reginald <unk> . This cross was designed to imitate medieval crosses found in <unk> in England with proportions more commonly seen in the Celtic cross . The cross is normally a <unk> four @-@ point limestone Latin cross , mounted on an octagonal base , and ranging in height from 14 to 32 feet . A bronze <unk> , blade down , is embedded on the face of the cross . This cross represents the faith of the majority of the dead and the sword represents the military character of the cemetery , intended to link British soldiers and the Christian concept of self @-@ sacrifice . 
 <unk> with more than 1000 burials typically have a Stone of Remembrance , designed by Edwin <unk> with the inscription " Their Name <unk> for <unk> " . The concept of the Stone of Remembrance stone was developed by <unk> Kipling to commemorate those of all faiths and none respectively . In contrast to the Cross of <unk> , the design for the stone deliberately avoided " shapes associated with particular religions " . The geometry of the structure was based on studies of the <unk> . Each stone is 3 @.@ 5 metres ( 11 ft ) long and 1 @.@ 5 metres ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) high . The shape of the stone has been compared both to that of a sarcophagus and an altar . The feature was designed using the principle of <unk> . The subtle curves in the design , if extended , would form a sphere 1 @,@ <unk> feet 8 inches ( <unk> @.@ 15 m ) in diameter . 
 Every grave is marked with a <unk> . Each <unk> contains the national emblem or regimental badge , rank , name , unit , date of death and age of each casualty inscribed above an appropriate religious symbol and a more personal dedication chosen by relatives . The <unk> use a standard upper case <unk> designed by MacDonald Gill . Individual graves are arranged , where possible , in straight rows and marked by uniform <unk> , the vast majority of which are made of Portland stone . The original <unk> dimensions were 76 centimetres ( 30 in ) tall , 38 cm ( 15 in ) wide , and 7 @.@ 6 cm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) thick . 
 Most <unk> are inscribed with a cross , except for those deceased known to be <unk> or non @-@ Christian . In the case of burials of Victoria Cross or George Cross recipients , the regimental badge is supplemented by the Victoria Cross or George Cross emblem . Sometimes a soldier employed a pseudonym because they were too young to serve or were sought by law enforcement ; in such cases their primary name is shown along with the <unk> " served as " . Many <unk> are for unidentified casualties ; they consequently bear only what could be discovered from the body . The <unk> , developed by <unk> Kipling , that appears on the graves of unidentified soldiers for which no details are known is " A Soldier of the Great War known <unk> God " . Some <unk> bear the text " believed to be buried in this cemetery " when they are believed to be buried in the cemetery but the exact location of the grave is not known . In some cases soldiers were buried in collective graves and distinguishing one body from another was not possible and thus one <unk> covers more than one grave . The <unk> does not denote any specific details of the death except for its date , and even then only if it is known , and are deliberately ambiguous about the cause of death . 
 Due to local conditions it was sometimes necessary for the Commission to deviate from its standard design . In places prone to extreme weather or earthquakes , such as Thailand and Turkey , stone @-@ faced pedestal markers are used instead of the normal <unk> . These measures are intended to prevent masonry being damaged during earthquakes or sinking into <unk> ground . In Italy <unk> were carved from <unk> <unk> limestone because it was in more plentiful supply . In <unk> Military Cemetery , in Greece , to avoid risk of earthquake damage , small <unk> are laid flat on the ground . The smaller size of the markers mean that they often lack unit insignia . 
 Variety in texture , height and timing of floral display were equally important <unk> <unk> . The beds around each <unk> are planted with a mixture of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . Low @-@ growing plants are chosen for areas immediately in front of <unk> , ensuring that inscriptions are not obscured and preventing soil from <unk> back during rain . In <unk> where there are pedestal grave markers , dwarf varieties of plants are used instead . 
 The <unk> is headquartered in <unk> , England . <unk> or agencies that are each responsible for a specific geographical area manage the worldwide affairs of the organisation . They are : 
 France Area is headed by a director and is responsible for France ( including the island of <unk> ) , Monaco and Switzerland . 
 Northern Europe Area , headed by a director and responsible for Austria , Belgium , Czech Republic , Denmark , <unk> , Germany , Hungary , Latvia , Lithuania , <unk> , Netherlands , Norway , Poland and Sweden . 
 United Kingdom Area , headed by a director and responsible for Channel Islands , <unk> Islands , Iceland , Ireland , Isle of Man and the United Kingdom 
 Mediterranean Area headed by a director and responsible for <unk> , Algeria , Azerbaijan , Azores , Bahrain , Canary Islands , Croatia , Cyprus , Egypt , Gibraltar , Greece , Israel and Palestine , Italy , Jordan , Lebanon , Libya , Macedonia , Madeira , Malta , <unk> , Morocco , Oman , Portugal , San Marino , Saudi Arabia , Serbia , Spain , Syria , Tunisia , Turkey , United Arab Emirates and <unk> 
 Canadian Agency is headed by a secretary @-@ general and responsible for Canada , the entire Americas ( including the Caribbean ) 
 Australia , managed by the Office of Australian War Graves in the Australian Department of Veterans Affairs on behalf of the <unk> , is responsible for Australia , Norfolk Island , Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands 
 New Zealand , managed by the New Zealand Ministry of Culture and Heritage on behalf of the <unk> , is responsible for New Zealand , New Caledonia , Samoa , Society Islands , Tonga and <unk> 
 South Africa Agency is headed by a secretary and is responsible for Republic of South Africa , <unk> , Saint Helena and Ascension Island 
 Africa , Asia and Pacific Area is headed by a director and is responsible for areas not covered by any of the other bodies . 
 The <unk> 's work is funded predominantly by grants from the governments of the six member states . In the fiscal year 2012 / 13 , these grants amounted to £ 58 @.@ 6 million of the organisation 's £ 66 @.@ 5 million of income . This <unk> to an approximate cost of C $ 85 per commemorated war dead . The contribution from each country is proportionate to the number of graves the <unk> maintains on behalf of that country . The percentage of total annual contributions for which each country is responsible is United Kingdom 78 @.@ 4 % , Canada 10 @.@ 1 % , Australia 6 @.@ 1 % , New Zealand 2 @.@ 1 % , South Africa 2 @.@ 1 % and India 1 @.@ 2 % . 
 A project is underway to photograph the graves of and memorials to all service personnel from 1914 to the present day and make the images available to the public . The work is being carried out by The War Graves <unk> Project in conjunction with the <unk> . As of August 2013 , the project has recorded 1 @.@ 7 million photographs for <unk> . 
 Immediately following the First World War , the British Army remained responsible for the <unk> of remains . The Western Front was divided into sectors and <unk> for bodies by 12 @-@ man <unk> units . Between the Armistice and September 1921 , the <unk> units reburied 204 @,@ <unk> bodies . After 1921 , no further widespread search for bodies was undertaken and in February 1921 responsibility of the <unk> was transferred to the Commission . Despite the <unk> searches , bodies continued to be discovered in numbers . In the three years following the conclusion of the general search 38 @,@ 000 bodies were discovered . In the mid 1920s , 20 to 30 bodies were being discovered weekly . 
 The discovery of remains of First and Second World War casualties remains a common occurrence with approximately 30 bodies discovered annually . For example , in 2006 eight bodies of Canadian soldiers from the 78th Battalion ( Winnipeg <unk> ) , <unk> were discovered in a backyard in <unk> , France . In April 2013 , the remains of four British soldiers discovered by a French farmer clearing land with metal detector in 2009 were re @-@ interred at <unk> Cemetery near <unk> , France . In March 2014 , the remains of 20 Commonwealth and 30 German soldiers were discovered in <unk> @-@ le @-@ <unk> , France with the Commonwealth soldiers being subsequently reburied at <unk> British Cemetery . 
 When the remains of a Commonwealth soldier from the First or Second World War is discovered the Commission is notified and a Commission burial officer tries to collect any associated artifacts that may help in identify the remains . The details are then registered and archived at the Commission 's <unk> the collection of evidence can include artifacts with the remains , <unk> data and DNA . The archival records of the commission are open to the public to permit individuals to conduct their own research . Investigation of archival records by members of the public periodically result in the identification of previously buried casualties . In December 2013 , it was discovered that Second Lieutenant Philip Frederick <unk> , who was previously commemorated on the <unk> Flying Services Memorial , had in fact been buried in a French military cemetery in <unk> , East @-@ Flanders in Belgium . Sergeant Leonard <unk> was identified in 2013 after a visitor to <unk> British Cemetery discovered a <unk> of an unknown sergeant with the Hampshire Regiment killed on 20 July 1918 and was subsequently able to show that only one sergeant from that regiment had been killed in France on that date . 
 <unk> , including those of war dead , are targets for vandalism . The gravestones , <unk> and buildings of the Commission are no exception . The Commission believes that graffiti and damage to stonework are usually the <unk> <unk> by young people , noting the number of incidents increases when schoolchildren are on school holidays . <unk> thieves will also steal the bronze swords off the Cross of <unk> , which are now replaced with identical ones made in fibreglass . 
 The vandalism of Commission <unk> has also been connected to the participation of Commonwealth countries in contemporary conflicts . In the 1970s , in The Troubles , Commission <unk> in Ireland experienced vandalism . <unk> defaced the central memorial of the <unk> Military Cemetery in northern France with anti @-@ British and anti @-@ American graffiti on 20 March 2003 immediately after the beginning of the Iraq War . On 9 May 2004 , thirty @-@ three <unk> were demolished in the Gaza cemetery , which contains 3 @,@ 691 graves , allegedly in retaliation for the Abu <unk> prisoner abuse scandal . On 24 February 2012 , during the <unk> Civil War , an Islamist militia damaged over 200 <unk> in the <unk> war cemetery as well as the central memorial . 
 <unk> or <unk> ( <unk> or <unk> ; c . <unk> – <unk> ) was the tenth Archbishop of Canterbury from 731 to <unk> . Prior to becoming archbishop , he was a monk and abbot of a Benedictine monastery . Besides his ecclesiastical career , <unk> was a writer , and <unk> he composed survive . Another work he composed was on the grammar of the Latin language , which was aimed at advanced students of that language . He was subsequently considered a saint . 
 The Type <unk> I was a class of small coastal submarines ( U @-@ boats ) built in Germany at the beginning of the First World War . 20 boats were constructed , most of which went into service with the German Imperial Navy . Boats of this design were also operated by the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy ( <unk> und <unk> Kriegsmarine or <unk> Kriegsmarine ) and the Bulgarian Navy . The group is sometimes known as the <unk> @-@ 1 class after SM <unk> @-@ 1 , the class leader . In the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy , it was called the U @-@ 10 class . 
 Built to meet the need for small <unk> submarines able to operate in the narrow , shallow seas off Flanders , the vessels were intended to be quickly constructed , then shipped by rail and assembled at their port of operation . The design effort began in mid @-@ August 1914 and by mid @-@ October the first 15 boats were ordered from two German shipyards . The German Imperial Navy subsequently ordered an additional pair of boats to replace two sold to Austria @-@ Hungary , who ordered a further three boats in April 1915 . A total of 20 <unk> Is were built . Construction of the first boats for Germany began in early November 1914 ; all 20 were completed by October 1915 . Several of the first boats underwent trials in German home waters , but the rest were assembled and tested at either Antwerp or Pola . The German boats operated primarily in the Flanders , Baltic , and Constantinople <unk> . The boats were about 28 metres ( 92 ft ) long and displaced 127 tonnes ( 125 long tons ) when surfaced and 142 tonnes ( 140 long tons ) while submerged . All had two bow torpedo tubes and two torpedoes , and were equipped with a deck @-@ mounted machine gun . 
 In 1918 four of the surviving German boats were converted into coastal <unk> . Of the seventeen boats in German service , two were sold to Austria @-@ Hungary , one was sold to Bulgaria , and nine were lost during the war . One of the five Austro @-@ Hungarian boats was sunk and another mined and not repaired . The five surviving German boats , the four surviving Austro @-@ Hungarian boats , and the Bulgarian boat were all turned over to the Allies after the end of the war and were broken up . 
 In the earliest stages of the First World War the German Army 's rapid advance along the North Sea coast found the German Imperial Navy without submarines suitable to operate in the narrow and shallow seas off Flanders . By 18 August 1914 , two weeks after the German invasion of Belgium , the planning of a series of small coastal submarines had already begun . 
 The German Imperial Navy stipulated that the submarines must be <unk> by rail , which imposed a maximum diameter of 3 @.@ 15 metres ( 10 ft 4 in ) . The rushed planning effort — which had been assigned the name " Project 34 " — resulted in the Type <unk> I design , created specifically for operation from Flanders . The boats were to be about 28 metres ( 92 ft ) long and to displace about 125 tonnes ( 123 long tons ) with two bow torpedo tubes . 
 Boats of the Type <unk> I design were built by two manufacturers , Germaniawerft of Kiel and AG <unk> of <unk> , which led to some variations in boats from the two shipyards . The eight Germaniawerft @-@ built boats were slightly longer at 28 @.@ 10 metres ( 92 ft 2 in ) length overall , while the twelve <unk> @-@ built boats came in 22 centimetres ( 8 @.@ 7 in ) shorter than their counterparts . All were 3 @.@ 15 metres ( 10 ft 4 in ) abeam and had a draft of 3 @.@ 03 metres ( 9 ft 11 in ) . The boats all displaced 127 tonnes ( 125 long tons ) while surfaced , but differed slightly in displacement submerged . The slightly longer Germaniawerft boats displaced 142 tonnes ( 140 long tons ) while submerged , as they weighed 1 <unk> ( 0 @.@ 98 long tons ) more than the <unk> boats . 
 The <unk> of the boats consisted of a single propeller shaft driven by a <unk> ( Germaniawerft ) or <unk> ( <unk> ) diesel engine on the surface , or a <unk> @-@ <unk> electric motor for underwater travel . The <unk> boats were capable of nearly 7 @.@ 5 knots ( 13 @.@ 9 km / h ; 8 @.@ 6 mph ) on the surface and a little more than 6 knots ( 11 km / h ; 6 @.@ 9 mph ) submerged . The Germaniawerft boats were about 1 knot ( 1 @.@ 9 km / h ; 1 @.@ 2 mph ) slower than their <unk> @-@ made counterparts . The boats were equipped with two 45 @-@ <unk> ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) bow torpedo tubes and carried two torpedoes . They were also armed with a single 8 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) machine gun affixed to the deck . 
 <unk> @-@ 1 and <unk> @-@ 2 were laid down on 1 November 1914 at the Germaniawerft yard at Kiel . <unk> @-@ 1 was launched on 22 January 1915 , just 75 working days later . <unk> @-@ 2 's launch followed on 13 February . Among the <unk> boats , <unk> @-@ 9 was laid down first , on 6 November 1914 , and launched on 6 February 1915 , a week ahead of <unk> @-@ 2 . These first three boats launched underwent trials in home waters , but most of the other members of the class were shipped via rail and underwent trials at their assembly point . 
 The process of shipping the submarines by rail involved breaking the submarines down into what was essentially a knock down kit . Each boat was broken into approximately fifteen pieces and loaded on to eight railway <unk> . Type <unk> I boats destined for service with the Flanders Flotilla made a five @-@ day journey to Antwerp for the <unk> to three @-@ week assembly process . After assembly at Antwerp the boats were towed by barge to Bruges for trials . Boats selected for service in the Mediterranean were sent to the Austro @-@ Hungarian port of Pola for assembly . The total time from departure of the <unk> from the shipyard to operational readiness for the boats was about six weeks . 
 During their trials the Type <unk> Is were found to be too small and too slow and had a reputation for being <unk> ; one commander compared his Type <unk> I to a " <unk> machine " . According to authors R. H. Gibson and Maurice <unk> in their 1931 book The German <unk> War , 1914 – 1918 , the <unk> did not have enough power to chase down <unk> while surfaced and lacked the endurance to spend any extended amount of time underwater , exhausting their batteries after little over an hour 's running . In @-@ service use revealed another problem : with a single propeller shaft / engine combination , if either component failed , the U @-@ boat was almost totally disabled . 
 Another reported problem with the Type <unk> Is was the tendency to break trim after the firing of torpedoes . The boats were equipped with <unk> tanks designed to flood and offset the loss of the C / 06 torpedo 's 1 @,@ 700 @-@ pound ( 770 kg ) weight , but this system did not always function properly ; as a result , when firing from <unk> depth the boat could <unk> after firing or , if too much weight was taken on , <unk> to the depths . When <unk> @-@ 15 torpedoed and sank Italian submarine <unk> in June 1915 , the tank failed to properly compensate , forcing the entire crew to run to the stern to offset the trim imbalance . 
 Despite the problems , the " tin <unk> " , as the Germans referred to them , were in active service from March 1915 through the end of the war , with half of the 20 boats lost during the war . Boats of the class served in three navies : the German Imperial Navy , the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy , and the Bulgarian Navy . In German service , they served primarily in the Flanders Flotilla , the Baltic Flotilla , and the Constantinople Flotilla . 
 <unk> @-@ 4 departed on the first patrol from Flanders on 9 April , and was responsible for sinking the first ship sent down by the flotilla . The Type <unk> I boats of the Flanders Flotilla originally patrolled the area between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands , but began patrolling the English Channel after <unk> @-@ 6 pioneered a route past British <unk> nets and mines in the Straits of Dover in late June . 
 <unk> @-@ 9 was initially assigned to the Baltic Flotilla , and was joined by <unk> @-@ 2 and <unk> @-@ 5 in early 1916 . All three became training boats at Kiel in 1916 , joining <unk> @-@ 11 in that duty . Little information is available about the Type <unk> I boats operating in the Baltic . 
 Four of the German Imperial Navy boats — <unk> @-@ 3 , <unk> @-@ 7 , <unk> @-@ 8 , and <unk> @-@ 14 — were selected for service with the Constantinople Flotilla . All were sent to Pola for assembly and trials there as part of the Pola Flotilla before sailing on to join the Constantinople Flotilla . <unk> @-@ 3 disappeared en route to Constantinople in May 1915 , but the other three arrived there by mid @-@ June . 
 The three Type <unk> I boats of the Constantinople Flotilla seem to have patrolled primarily in the Black Sea . <unk> @-@ 8 was transferred to the Bulgarian Navy in May 1916 , and <unk> @-@ 7 disappeared in the Black Sea in October 1916 , leaving <unk> @-@ 14 as the sole remaining German Type <unk> I in the flotilla ; she was surrendered at Sevastopol in November 1918 to French armies stationed there during the Russian Civil War . 
 <unk> @-@ 1 and the still incomplete <unk> @-@ 15 were sold to the Austria @-@ Hungary in February 1915 ; both were dismantled and shipped to Pola in May . After one cruise under the German flag , each boat was commissioned into the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy . The pair — renamed U @-@ 10 and U @-@ 11 , respectively — were joined by U @-@ 15 , U @-@ 16 , and U @-@ 17 in October . Known as the U @-@ 10 or the <unk> ( English : <unk> ) class as a part of the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy , the five boats operated primarily in the Adriatic in patrols off Italy and <unk> . U @-@ 10 ( ex <unk> @-@ 1 ) hit a mine in July 1918 and was <unk> , but had not been repaired by the end of the war . U @-@ 16 was sunk after she torpedoed an Italian destroyer in October 1916 , and the remaining three ( and the <unk> U @-@ 10 ) were ceded to Italy at the end of the war . 
 After <unk> @-@ 8 was transferred to the Bulgarian Navy in May 1916 , she was renamed <unk> No. 18 ( in Cyrillic : <unk> No. 18 ) . She was Bulgaria 's first submarine , and was engaged primarily in coastal defense duties off Bulgaria 's main Black Sea port of <unk> . <unk> No. 18 survived the war and was ceded to France after the Treaty of <unk> @-@ sur @-@ Seine . 
 20 Type <unk> I submarines were built , 17 for the German Imperial Navy and three for the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy . Two of the German submarines — <unk> @-@ 1 and <unk> @-@ 15 — were sold to Austria @-@ Hungary and commissioned into the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy as U @-@ 10 and U @-@ 11 , respectively . Those two and a further three built by AG <unk> comprised the virtually identical U @-@ 10 class for the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy . Another of the German submarines , <unk> @-@ 8 , was sold to Bulgaria in May 1916 , becoming <unk> No. 18 . 
 In the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy the Type <unk> I boats were known as the U @-@ 10 class , which consisted of two former German Type <unk> I boats and three built specifically for Austria @-@ Hungary . 
 In addition , four of the German Type <unk> Is assigned to the Pola Flotilla based at the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy 's main naval base at Pola were assigned Austro @-@ Hungarian designations . 
 These four boats remained under commission in the German Imperial Navy , retained German crews and commanders , and received orders from the German flotilla commander at Pola . 
 Germany and Bulgaria negotiated the purchase of two <unk> I boats for the Bulgarian Navy , <unk> @-@ 7 and <unk> @-@ 8 , in 1916 . Two crews of Bulgarian sailors were sent to Kiel for training . Before the purchase could be completed , <unk> @-@ 7 was sunk , leaving only one boat for Bulgaria . On 25 May 1916 , <unk> @-@ 8 was officially transferred to Bulgaria for the remainder of the war . 
 The military history of Gibraltar during World War II exemplifies Gibraltar 's position as a British fortress since the early 18th century and as a vital factor in British military strategy , both as a foothold on the continent of Europe , and as a <unk> of British sea power . During World War II , Gibraltar served a vital role in both the Atlantic Theatre and the Mediterranean Theatre , controlling virtually all naval traffic into and out of the Mediterranean Sea from the Atlantic Ocean . 
 Inside the Rock of Gibraltar itself , miles of tunnels were excavated from the limestone . <unk> of rock were blasted out to build an " underground city " . In huge man @-@ made <unk> , barracks , offices , and a fully equipped hospital were constructed , complete with an operating theatre and X @-@ ray equipment . 
 Operation <unk> , the Allied invasion of French North Africa in November 1942 , was coordinated from the " Rock " . General Dwight D. Eisenhower , who was given command of the operation , set up his headquarters in Gibraltar during the planning phases of the operation . Following the successful completion of the North African campaign and the surrender of Italy in 1943 , Gibraltar 's role shifted from a forward operating base to a rear @-@ area supply position . The harbour continued to operate dry docks and supply depots for the convoy routes through the Mediterranean until V @-@ E Day in 1945 . 
 World War II dramatically changed the lives of <unk> . The decision to enforce mass evacuation in order to increase the strength of the Rock with more military and naval personnel meant that most <unk> ( some for up to ten years ) had nowhere to call ' home ' . Only those civilians with essential jobs were allowed to stay but it gave the entire community a sense of being ' British ' by sharing in the war effort . 
 British conservative politician Oliver Stanley agreed to accept the <unk> in the United Kingdom , but he argued with Gibraltar over the number of people involved . The Governor , he declared , had given the number of <unk> first as 13 @,@ 000 , then as 14 @,@ 000 and finally as 16 @,@ 000 . He asked for the situation to be clarified , stressing the shortage of accommodation in Britain and insisting that only 13 @,@ 000 could be accepted , 2 @,@ 000 of whom were to be sent to the Portuguese Atlantic island of Madeira . The situation , replied General <unk> on 19 July , " is that this is a fortress liable to heavy and immediate attack and there should be no civilians here whereas there are 22 @,@ 000 . The 13 @,@ 000 was the number sent to Morocco , and more would have been sent had the situation there not altered . " In London the <unk> were placed in the hands of the Ministry of Health , and many were housed in Kensington area . Concern for them in Gibraltar mounted as the air raids against London intensified , coupled with the arrival of <unk> letters , describing the circumstances in which the <unk> were living . 
 In September rumours were already circulating among the <unk> , and in Gibraltar , that the possibility of re @-@ evacuating the <unk> once more was being <unk> , this time the destination being Jamaica , in the West Indies . After much contention , it was decided to send a party directly from Gibraltar to the island , and 1 @,@ <unk> <unk> left for Jamaica direct , on 9 October , with more following later on . However <unk> followed and the demands were met , partly for strategic reasons and the lack of available shipping . The situation at the end of 1940 , therefore , was that approximately 2 @,@ 000 <unk> were in Jamaica and a lesser number in Madeira , with the bulk of around 10 @,@ 000 housed in the London area . 
 Construction of a solid surface runway began in late 1939 and in 1940 it was proposed to extend the existing runway to a length of 1 @,@ 550 yards ( 1 @,@ <unk> m ) . The land <unk> commenced towards the end of 1941 along with the construction of an RAF camp at the " North Front " , now RAF Gibraltar . The RAF dispatched their next squadron to Gibraltar at this time and it was in September 1939 that war with Germany was declared and the strong possibility of German submarines concentrating in the Strait of Gibraltar and using Spanish port facilities , <unk> large in Admiralty thinking . So at 09 : 00 ( UTC ) on the 9 September 1939 , No. 202 Squadron RAF was ordered to Gibraltar , loaded to the <unk> with equipment . 
 On 25 September 1939 , No 200 ( Coastal ) Group was formed as a subordinate formation to HQ RAF Mediterranean in control of No 202 <unk> . The Group 's function was the control of Royal Air Force units operating from Gibraltar . In late 1940 the Group was transferred to Coastal Command . Later a combined HQ was formed which commenced operations in early 1942 . 
 On 18 July 1940 , after the attack on the French Fleet at <unk> @-@ el @-@ <unk> by the British , the <unk> government authorized a bombing raid of Gibraltar as a response . Little damage was reported to have been done . 
 On Tuesday , 24 September , the Italian Stefani news agency reported : " As a reprisal for the bombardment of <unk> yesterday morning , one @-@ hundred @-@ and @-@ twenty French aircraft based in Morocco attacked Gibraltar . " On the same day , the United Press Agency reported : " The French government has issued an official denial of reports , according to which French aircraft were said to have attacked Gibraltar . Up until now , no <unk> have been undertaken . " But the United Press report ended on an ominous note with : " French <unk> are imminent . " 
 No British aircraft were encountered and much damage was done in the area south of the fortress . The South Mole and a large ship in the harbour were heavily damaged . In the northern part of Gibraltar , fires broke out . 
 On 25 September , the French returned with a larger force of eighty @-@ three bombers to cause additional damage to the naval base and harbour installations . Again , aircraft of the British Royal Air Force made no appearance . However , the French crews did report encountering heavy anti @-@ aircraft fire . One <unk> 451 bomber was lost and 13 other aircraft were lightly damaged during the two days of bombing attacks . The British armed trawler <unk> Stella Sirius was sunk by bombs . 
 The Rock came through the war relatively unscathed but , given its strategic importance , Germany made plans to capture Gibraltar . <unk> " Felix " , the plan which was signed by Adolf Hitler himself was formulated at the highest level of command . With or without permission , Germany would take entry through Spain and attack Gibraltar driving the British out of the Western Mediterranean . The Strait would be effectively closed to the Allies once Gibraltar was in German hands , forcing Asia @-@ bound Allied shipping to steam all the way around Africa rather than to proceed to the east via the shorter route through the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal . The Rock was to be heavily dive bombed by planes leaving France but landing afterward at Spanish air bases . To deny a possible Spanish capture of the base , the German planners decided that the final attack to seize Gibraltar was to be made by German troops alone . 
 <unk> failure at the highest levels of government prevented the operation from occurring at the beginning of 1941 which had been drawn up in detail by the Wehrmacht in the summer and autumn of 1940 . 
 General Ludwig <unk> 's <unk> Corps would conduct the actual attack on the Rock . The assault forces would comprise the Infantry Regiment <unk> , the <unk> Regiment of the 1st Mountain Division , 26 medium and heavy artillery battalions , three observation battalions , three engineer battalions , two smoke battalions , a detachment of 150 <unk> , and up to 150 miniature remote controlled demolition vehicles ( <unk> ) , packed with high explosives . 
 As part of a combined @-@ force operation , the German Air Force ( Luftwaffe ) would contribute Ju <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , three light AA battalions , and three heavy AA battalions . Nazi Germany 's Kriegsmarine would cooperate by using U @-@ boats to interfere with British naval movement and <unk> coastal batteries to further discourage the Royal Navy . 
 On 10 March 1941 , with Operation Barbarossa looming , Felix was amended to Operation Felix @-@ Heinrich , whereby German troops would be withdrawn from the USSR to capture Gibraltar . As a result of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco 's <unk> , the operation was postponed , modified , and ultimately abandoned . 
 From Sardinia , Italian <unk> <unk> bombers attacked Gibraltar several times , mainly in 1942 . The last raids on Gibraltar were done during the 1943 Allied landing in Algeria , when those bombers hit successfully even the <unk> port . 
 The only unit of the Regia <unk> ( Royal Air Force ) ever to fly the <unk> <unk> was the " <unk> Long @-@ Range <unk> Squadron " . This unit was formed in May 1941 around the first machines that came off the assembly lines . The training of the crews lasted far longer than anticipated and only in June 1942 the <unk> became operational . The most spectacular raids with the P. 108 bombers were flown in October 1942 when several night attacks against Gibraltar were undertaken from Sardinia . 
 After the armistice of <unk> ( 8 September ) , the German @-@ allied Italian Social Republic launched at least two raids on Gibraltar : one on the night of 4 – 5 June 1944 with ten <unk> aircraft and another on 6 June with nine aircraft . Both sorties were undertaken by the <unk> <unk> " <unk> – <unk> " . 
 Known as the " <unk> <unk> Horse of Gibraltar " , <unk> <unk> <unk> , an Italian commando <unk> unit created during the <unk> government , engaged in numerous attacks against the harbour at Gibraltar . 
 Gibraltar was a very tempting target for the Italians , who saw it as a refuge for British warships and allied merchant shipping . The Italian <unk> originally used a Spanish villa ( Villa <unk> ) located two miles ( 3 km ) from Gibraltar owned by an Italian officer who had married a Spanish woman named <unk> <unk> . Their base was shifted later to the Italian <unk> SS <unk> , interned in <unk> . 
 <unk> operations were ordered from Berlin in the late autumn of 1940 , but actual work did not start until early 1941 . The first operations were unsuccessful . A first attempt to smuggle a bomb into Gibraltar was <unk> , as the timing device was faulty . In February there was a large explosion in the North Tunnel , and in April a bomb blew up near the airfield . In June 1941 , however , the British intelligence <unk> a new attempt , by a German agent , to attach a mine alongside an Allied cargo ship . Another attempt failed when <unk> placed a bomb inside an ammunition store but was not able to bring the explosive . It was not until 1942 that the operations begun to succeed . In January 1942 , two Spanish agents manage to destroy two aircraft at the North Front landing strip . 
 Operation <unk> was a top @-@ secret British stay @-@ behind <unk> mission that was only to be implemented if Gibraltar was captured by the Axis Powers . Six men were to be sealed in a cave and left with only enough supplies for a year . The volunteers — two doctors , three <unk> and their leader — would run an observation post with one 12 @-@ inch ( 300 mm ) by 6 @-@ inch ( 150 mm ) slit looking over the harbour and a concealed outdoor terrace over the Mediterranean . The team would then wire back all shipping movements to the British Admiralty . 
 They were told there would be no way out and anyone who died within the chamber would have to be embalmed and cemented into the brick floor . Only if Germany was defeated within their first year would they be released . 
 As the threat of invasion was clearly felt in late 1941 , an idea for a series of secret observation posts ( first in Gibraltar and later in other places like Malta and Aden ) was put together under Operation <unk> . 
 Work in Gibraltar began immediately under Commander Geoffrey <unk> and his chief engineer Colonel Fordham . The site chosen at Lord <unk> 's Battery on the southern tip of the Rock already had an existing <unk> scheme for a shelter . Extensive trials of the equipment began in January 1942 under the eye of MI6 radio expert Colonel Richard Gambier @-@ Parry . Much thought was also given to the type of men needed for such a strange and demanding task . A member of Scott ’ s ill @-@ <unk> expedition to the Antarctic , George Murray <unk> was called up as Surgeon @-@ Commander to advise on survival techniques . There were practical matters such as diet , exercise , sanitation , and clothing to consider as well as vital " psychology of the personnel " . The full team was in place by the end of summer 1942 and their cavern fully equipped and ready for occupation . A comprehensive manual was prepared on all aspects of the operation and it was considered that similar secret lookout posts should be prepared throughout the world in the event of future wars . However , Operation <unk> was never needed , as Adolf Hitler turned his attention away from Gibraltar and towards the Eastern Front . 
 The operation had been <unk> in mystery until the discovery of papers at the Public Record Office in <unk> UK . Previously in the 1960s , details of the story were told to a journalist by his intelligence service contacts and he wrote these up as " Operation Monkey " , yet facts were very sparse . 
 In 1997 " Stay Behind Cave " ( as it was nicknamed ) was discovered in Gibraltar by the Gibraltar <unk> Group , but no account was ever obtained from anyone associated with the mission . The discovery came about when the group encountered a strong gust of wind in a tunnel . Further searching led them to break through a wall into chambers which had never been used and had remained sealed for over 50 years . 
 In November 2006 Jim <unk> and Sergeant Major Pete Jackson , senior tunnel guide with the Royal Gibraltar Regiment , met possibly the only member of Operation <unk> still alive when they travelled to meet Dr. W. A. Bruce Cooper at his home in England . Cooper , 92 at the time , provided an opportunity to shed light on the operation with his direct involvement in the mission as a Surgeon @-@ Lieutenant in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve ( <unk> ) . He recalled stories about his colleagues , his training , and his feelings about the task . 
 The Mediterranean U @-@ boat Campaign lasted approximately from 21 September 1941 to May 1944 . The Kriegsmarine tried to isolate Gibraltar , Malta , and Suez and disrupt Britain 's trade routes . More than sixty U @-@ boats were sent to <unk> Allied shipping in the Mediterranean Sea . Many of these U @-@ boats were themselves attacked negotiating the Strait of Gibraltar controlled by Britain . Nine U @-@ boats were sunk while attempting passage and ten more were damaged . 
 Plans for the Allied counter offensive after the attack on Pearl Harbor were ongoing by mid @-@ 1942 . An invasion of Europe in 1943 would be <unk> , but the allies could attack the " soft <unk> of Europe " through the Mediterranean , as Prime Minister Winston Churchill put it . <unk> by President Franklin Roosevelt and Churchill and code named Operation <unk> , the plan was to occupy French North Africa : Morocco , Algeria , and Tunisia . From these French colonies , attacks could be launched that would drive Italy out of the war . 
 In July 1942 , Lieutenant General Dwight D. Eisenhower was appointed Allied Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of Operation <unk> . Churchill placed Gibraltar under the command of General Eisenhower as the temporary headquarters for this , the first large @-@ scale Anglo @-@ American operation of the war . He arrived in Gibraltar on 5 November 1942 to take over , not just command of Operation <unk> itself , but also military command of Gibraltar . 
 General Eisenhower stayed at The <unk> , the official Governor 's residence , but his operational headquarters were in a small chamber in a tunnel in the heart of the Rock . In his memoirs General Eisenhower wrote : 
 The subterranean passages under the Rock provided the sole available office space , and in them was located the signal equipment by which we expected to keep in touch with the commanders of the three assault forces . The eternal darkness of the tunnels was here and there partially pierced by <unk> electric bulbs . <unk> , cold air in block @-@ long passages was heavy with stagnation and did not noticeably respond to the <unk> efforts of electric fans . Through the arched ceilings came a constant <unk> , <unk> , <unk> of surface water that faithfully but <unk> <unk> off the seconds of the <unk> , almost <unk> , wait which always occurs between completion of a military plan and the moment action begins . 
 One hundred thousand soldiers on the high seas in a multitude of transports <unk> on Gibraltar . More than 400 aircraft of all types were <unk> into the dispersal areas around the Gibraltar runway . Fighters had been shipped in <unk> and assembled on the airfield . Every available area of storage was taken up with ammunition , fuel , and other essential supplies . 168 American pilots were housed in the RAF <unk> at North Front . 
 From their headquarters in Gibraltar , General Eisenhower and Admiral Sir Andrew Browne Cunningham directed Operation <unk> , the first major combined combat operation during World War II involving American and British forces . 
 Given that Gibraltar was a small town with only a few defences protecting it , the solution was to build a massive series of tunnels and chambers inside the natural protection of the Rock of Gibraltar . This " town " inside the Rock contained its own power station , water supply , and hospital . Some soldiers posted here would not see the light of day for months on end . Two Canadian engineer companies , the only soldiers with diamond @-@ tipped drills and 5 British engineer companies , added some 30 miles ( 48 km ) of such tunnels , a feat thought impossible at the time . That was enough to hold all 30 @,@ 000 troops on the rock . Today , the rock has more underground tunnels than roads . 
 On 4 July 1943 , a Liberator bomber from RAF Transport Command took off from Gibraltar for England . On board was General Władysław <unk> , Prime Minister of Poland 's London @-@ based government in exile and Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of its armed forces , returning from visiting Polish troops in the Middle East . 
 The aircraft climbed normally from the runway , levelled off to gather speed but then suddenly lost height and crashed into the harbour . The 62 @-@ year @-@ old general died , along with 15 others . The sole survivor was the Czech @-@ born pilot , Eduard <unk> , who was rescued by an RAF launch . The bodies of five passengers and crew , including <unk> 's daughter , were never found . 
 The coffins of General <unk> and his Chief @-@ of @-@ Staff , General <unk> , were draped in the Polish National Flag and lay in state in the Cathedral of St. Mary the <unk> . After a <unk> Mass , the bodies were carried in procession to the <unk> Dockyard with full Military Honours to be shipped to London in anticipation that General <unk> 's remains would one day be returned to a liberated Poland . The route to the dockyard was lined by British troops and the coffins carried and escorted by Polish <unk> . 
 In 1943 a British Court of Inquiry investigated the crash of <unk> 's Liberator II <unk> , but was unable to determine the probable cause , finding only that it was an accident and the " aircraft became uncontrollable for reasons which cannot be established " . A popular theory was insufficient technical maintenance leading to <unk> aircraft controls . Despite this finding , the political context of the event , coupled with a variety of curious circumstances , immediately gave rise to speculation that <unk> 's death had been no accident , and may in fact have been the direct result of a Soviet , British or even Polish conspiracy . 
 The surrender of Italy in September 1943 lifted any possible objections to the return of the <unk> to the Rock . As a result , a <unk> Board was established in November , and at a meeting of the Board on 8 February 1944 repatriation priorities were finally agreed . On 6 April 1944 the first group of 1 @,@ 367 <unk> arrived on the Rock directly from the United Kingdom and on 28 May , the first repatriation party left Madeira , and by the end of 1944 only 520 non @-@ priority <unk> remained on the island . 
 In London , home @-@ <unk> were making claims on the <unk> ’ wartime accommodation and 500 <unk> were re @-@ evacuated to Scotland and 3 @,@ 000 to camps in Northern Ireland . Although the Governor , Lt. General Sir Noel Mason @-@ MacFarlane , fought <unk> on behalf of the <unk> and did not accept the lack of accommodation as a sufficient reason for the delays . As late as 1947 there were still 2 @,@ 000 in Northern Irish camps . The last of the <unk> did not see the Rock again until 1951 . 
 On 18 September 96 , <unk> was assassinated in a palace conspiracy involving members of the <unk> Guard and several of his freedmen . On the same day , <unk> was declared emperor by the Roman Senate . This was the first time the Senate elected a Roman Emperor . As the new ruler of the Roman Empire , he vowed to restore liberties which had been curtailed during the <unk> government of <unk> . 
 <unk> 's brief reign was marred by financial difficulties and his inability to assert his authority over the Roman army . A revolt by the <unk> Guard in October 97 essentially forced him to adopt an heir . After some <unk> <unk> adopted Trajan , a young and popular general , as his successor . After barely fifteen months in office , <unk> died of natural causes on 27 January 98 . Upon his death he was succeeded and deified by Trajan . 
 Although much of his life remains obscure , <unk> was considered a wise and moderate emperor by ancient historians . <unk> 's greatest success was his ability to ensure a peaceful transition of power after his death , thus founding the <unk> – <unk> dynasty . 
 Like <unk> , the founder of the <unk> dynasty , <unk> was a member of the Italian nobility rather than one of the elite of Rome . Nevertheless , the <unk> were among the most esteemed and prominent political families of the late Republic and early Empire , attaining <unk> in each successive generation . The direct ancestors of <unk> on his father 's side , all named Marcus <unk> <unk> , were associated with imperial circles since the time of Emperor Augustus ( 27 BC – AD 14 ) . 
 Not much of <unk> 's early life or career is recorded , but it appears he did not pursue the usual administrative or military career . He was <unk> @-@ elect in the year 65 and , like his ancestors , moved in imperial circles as a skilled diplomat and strategist . As an advisor to Emperor <unk> , he successfully helped detect and expose the <unk> conspiracy of 65 . <unk> what his contribution to the investigation was is not known but his services must have been considerable , since they earned him rewards equal to those of <unk> 's guard prefect <unk> . He received <unk> honors — which was usually reserved for military victories — and the right to have his statues placed throughout the palace . 
 For services unknown , he was rewarded with a <unk> early in <unk> 's reign in 71 . This was a remarkable honour , not only because he held this office early under the new regime , but also because it was an ordinary <unk> ( instead of a less prestigious <unk> <unk> ) , making him one of the few non @-@ <unk> to be honoured in this way under <unk> . After 71 <unk> again disappears from historical record , presumably continuing his career as an inconspicuous advisor under <unk> ( 69 – 79 ) and his sons Titus ( 79 – 81 ) and <unk> ( 81 – 96 ) . 
 <unk> opened the year following the revolt by sharing the <unk> with <unk> . Again , the honour suggested <unk> had played a part in uncovering the conspiracy , perhaps in a fashion similar to what he did during the <unk> conspiracy under <unk> . Alternatively , <unk> may have selected <unk> as his colleague to emphasise the stability and status @-@ <unk> of the regime . The revolt had been suppressed , and the Empire could return to order . 
 On 18 September , 96 , <unk> was assassinated in a palace conspiracy organised by court officials . The <unk> <unk> , the <unk> Calendar , records that the same day the Senate proclaimed Marcus <unk> <unk> emperor . Despite his political experience , this was a remarkable choice . <unk> was old and <unk> , and had spent much of his career out of the public light , prompting both ancient and modern authors to speculate on his involvement in <unk> 's assassination . 
 Although he appeared to be an unlikely candidate on account of his age and weak health , <unk> was considered a safe choice precisely because he was old and <unk> . Furthermore , he had close connections with the <unk> dynasty and commanded the respect of a substantial part of the Senate . <unk> had seen the anarchy which had resulted from the death of <unk> ; he knew that to <unk> even for a few hours could lead to violent civil conflict . Rather than decline the invitation and risk <unk> , he accepted . The decision may have been hasty so as to avoid civil war , but neither the Senate nor <unk> appears to have been involved in the conspiracy against <unk> . 
 The change of government was welcome particularly to the <unk> , who had been harshly persecuted during <unk> 's reign . As an immediate gesture of goodwill towards his supporters , <unk> publicly <unk> that no <unk> would be put to death as long as he remained in office . He called an end to trials based on treason , released those who had been imprisoned under these charges , and granted amnesty to many who had been exiled . 
 All properties which had been confiscated by <unk> were returned to their respective families . <unk> also sought to involve the Senate in his government , but this was not entirely successful . He continued to rely largely on friends and advisors that were known and trusted , and by maintaining friendly relations with the pro @-@ <unk> faction of the Senate , he incurred hostility which may have been the cause for at least one conspiracy against his life . 
 Having been proclaimed emperor solely on the initiative of the Senate , <unk> had to introduce a number of measures to gain support among the Roman populace . As was custom by this time , a change of emperor was expected to bring with it a generous payment of gifts and money to the people and the army . Accordingly , a <unk> of 75 <unk> per head was bestowed upon the citizens , while the soldiers of the <unk> Guard received a <unk> which may have amounted to as much as 5000 <unk> per person . This was followed by a string of economic reforms intended to alleviate the burden of taxation from the most <unk> Romans . 
 Before long , <unk> 's expenses strained the economy of Rome and , although perhaps not ruinous to the extent once suggested by <unk> , necessitated the formation of a special commission of economy to drastically reduce <unk> . The most superfluous religious sacrifices , games and horse races were abolished , while new income was generated from <unk> 's former possessions , including the <unk> of ships , estates , and even furniture . Large amounts of money were obtained from <unk> 's silver and gold statues , and <unk> forbade that similar images be made in his honor . 
 Despite <unk> 's measures to remain popular with the Senate and the Roman people , support for <unk> remained strong in the army , which had called for his <unk> immediately after the assassination . In an attempt to appease the soldiers of the <unk> Guard , <unk> had dismissed their prefect Titus <unk> <unk> — one of the chief conspirators against <unk> — and replaced him with a former commander , <unk> <unk> . 
 Likewise , the generous <unk> bestowed upon the soldiers following his accession was expected to swiftly silence any protests against the violent regime change . The <unk> considered these measures insufficient , however , and demanded the execution of <unk> 's assassins , which <unk> refused . Continued dissatisfaction with this state of affairs would ultimately lead to the <unk> crisis of <unk> 's reign . 
 The situation was further aggravated by the absence of a clear successor , made more pressing because of <unk> 's old age and sickness . He had no natural children of his own and only distant relatives , who were unsuited for political office . A successor would have to be chosen from among the governors or generals in the Empire and it appears that , by 97 , <unk> was considering to adopt Marcus Cornelius <unk> <unk> <unk> , the powerful governor of Syria . This was covertly opposed by those who supported the more popular military commander Marcus <unk> <unk> , commonly known as Trajan , a general of the armies at the German frontier . 
 He realized that his position was no longer <unk> without the support of an heir who had the approval of both the army and the people . Shortly thereafter , he announced the adoption of Trajan as his successor , and with this decision all but abdicated . Trajan was formally bestowed with the title of Caesar and shared the <unk> with <unk> in 98 : 
 Contrary to the view here popularized by <unk> <unk> , however , <unk> had in fact little choice with regard to his successor . Faced with a major crisis , he desperately needed the support of a man who could restore his damaged reputation . The only candidate with sufficient military experience , <unk> ancestry , and connections was Trajan . Likewise , Edward <unk> 's assertion that <unk> <unk> established a tradition of succession through adoption among the Five Good <unk> has found little support among modern historians . 
 On 1 January , 98 , at the start of his fourth <unk> , <unk> suffered a stroke during a private audience . Shortly thereafter he was struck by a fever and died at his villa in the Gardens of <unk> , on 28 January . He was deified by the Senate , and his ashes were laid to rest in the <unk> of Augustus . 
 <unk> was succeeded without incident by his adopted son Trajan , who was greeted by the Roman populace with much enthusiasm . According to Pliny the Younger , Trajan dedicated a temple in honour of <unk> , yet no trace of it has ever been found ; nor was a commemorative series of coins for the <unk> <unk> issued until ten years after his death . According to <unk> <unk> , however , the Guard prefect responsible for the mutiny against <unk> , <unk> <unk> , was ' dismissed ' upon Trajan 's accession . 
 Due to the lack of written sources on this period , much of <unk> 's life has remained obscure . The most substantial surviving account of the reign of <unk> was written by the 3rd @-@ century historian <unk> <unk> . His Roman History , which spans nearly a millennium , from the arrival of <unk> in Italy until the year <unk> , was composed more than one hundred years after <unk> had died . Further details are added by an abridged biography from the <unk> de <unk> , a work alleged to have been authored by the 4th @-@ century historian Aurelius Victor . 
 Modern history has expanded upon this sentiment , characterizing <unk> as a well @-@ <unk> but weak and <unk> ruler . The Roman Senate enjoyed renewed liberties under his rule , but <unk> 's <unk> of the state finances and lack of authority over the army ultimately brought Rome near the edge of a significant crisis . The mutiny led by <unk> <unk> was never intended as a coup , but a calculated attempt to put pressure on the emperor . The adoption of Trajan expanded his power base with a respected , reliable general as his successor . <unk> concludes that <unk> 's real talents were in fact ill @-@ suited to the <unk> : 
 His place in Roman history is therefore summarized as a necessary , if tumultuous stop @-@ gap before the <unk> @-@ <unk> dynasties . It is a fact of irony that even the only major public work completed during his reign , the <unk> of <unk> , ultimately became known as the <unk> <unk> , or transitional forum . 
 Two modern statues which commemorate <unk> can be found in towns associated with him . There is an <unk> statue in Gloucester , England , a town which was founded in his honour . It is at the entrance to <unk> Street . There is also a statue at his alleged birthplace , <unk> in Italy , at <unk> <unk> street .

 The film was shot on location in New York City . It stars Paul Newman as " Fast " Eddie <unk> , Jackie Gleason as Minnesota <unk> , Piper Laurie as Sarah , and George C. Scott as Bert . 
 The <unk> was a major critical and popular success , gaining a reputation as a modern classic . Its exploration of winning , losing , and character garnered a number of major awards ; it is also credited with helping to spark a resurgence in the popularity of pool . Real @-@ life pool player Rudolf <unk> , known at the time as " New York <unk> " and " Chicago <unk> " , claimed to be the real life inspiration for Gleason 's character , Minnesota <unk> , and adopted the name as his own . 
 Eddie <unk> his belongings at the local bus terminal , where he meets Sarah <unk> , an alcoholic who is supported by her father , attends college part @-@ time , and walks with a limp . He meets her again at a bar . They go back to her place but she refuses to let him in , saying he is " too hungry " . Eddie moves into a <unk> house and starts <unk> for small stakes . He finds Sarah again and this time she takes him in , but with reservations . Charlie finds Eddie at Sarah 's and tries to persuade him to go back out on the road . Eddie refuses and Charlie realizes he plans to challenge <unk> again . Eddie realizes that Charlie held out his percentage and becomes enraged , believing that with that money he could have rebounded to beat <unk> . Eddie dismisses Charlie as a scared old man and tells him to " go lie down and die " by himself . 
 At Johnny 's Bar , Eddie joins a poker game where Bert is playing , and loses $ 20 . Afterward , Bert tells Eddie that he has talent as a pool player but no character . He figures that Eddie will need at least $ 3 @,@ 000 to challenge <unk> again . Bert calls him a " born loser " but nevertheless offers to stake him in return for 75 % of his <unk> ; Eddie refuses . 
 Eddie <unk> a local pool shark , exposing himself as a <unk> , and the other players punish him by breaking his <unk> . As he <unk> , Sarah cares for him and tells him she loves him , but he cannot say the words in return . When Eddie is ready to play , he agrees to Bert 's terms , deciding that a " 25 % slice of something big is better than a 100 % slice of nothing " . 
 Eddie returns to challenge <unk> again , putting up his entire $ 3 @,@ 000 stake on a single game . He wins game after game , beating <unk> so badly that <unk> is forced to quit . Bert demands a share of Eddie 's <unk> and threatens that Eddie will be injured unless he pays . But Eddie says that if he is not killed he will kill Bert when he recovers ; invoking the memory of Sarah , he <unk> Bert into giving up his claim . Instead , Bert orders Eddie never to walk into a big @-@ time pool hall again . Eddie and <unk> compliment each other as players , and Eddie walks out . 
 Pool champion Willie <unk> has a cameo appearance as Willie , who holds the stakes for Eddie and <unk> 's games . <unk> 's hands also appear in many of the <unk> shots . 
 The <unk> novel had been optioned several times , including by Frank Sinatra , but attempts to adapt it for the screen were unsuccessful . Director <unk> 's daughter Carol <unk> speculates that previous adaptations focused too much on the pool aspects of the story and not enough on the human interaction . <unk> , who had <unk> pool himself as a youth and who had made an abortive attempt to write a pool @-@ themed play called Corner Pocket , optioned the book and teamed with Sidney Carroll to produce the script . 
 According to Bobby <unk> 's agent , Martin Baum , Paul Newman 's agent turned down the part of Fast Eddie . Newman was originally unavailable to play Fast Eddie regardless , being committed to star opposite Elizabeth Taylor in the film Two for the <unk> . <unk> offered <unk> the part after seeing him on The Mike Wallace Interview . When Taylor was forced to drop out of <unk> because of shooting <unk> on Cleopatra , Newman was freed up to take the role , which he accepted after reading just half of the script . No one associated with the production officially notified <unk> or his representatives that he had been replaced ; they found out from a member of the public at a charity horse race . 
 <unk> filmed The <unk> over six weeks , entirely in New York City . Much of the action was filmed at two now @-@ defunct pool halls , <unk> 's and Ames <unk> Academy . Other shooting locations included a <unk> on East 82nd Street , which served as the Louisville home of Murray Hamilton 's character <unk> , and the Manhattan <unk> bus terminal . The film crew built a dining area that was so realistic that confused passengers sat there and waited to place their orders . Willie <unk> served as technical advisor on the film and shot a number of the trick shots in place of the actors . All of Gleason 's shots were his own ; they were filmed in wide @-@ angle to emphasize having the actor and the shot in the same frames . <unk> , in pursuit of the style he termed " neo @-@ neo @-@ realistic " , hired actual street thugs , enrolled them in the Screen Actors Guild and used them as extras . Scenes that were included in the shooting script but did not make it into the final film include a scene at Ames pool hall establishing that Eddie is on his way to town ( originally slated to be the first scene of the film ) and a longer scene of Preacher talking to Bert at Johnny 's Bar which establishes Preacher is a <unk> . 
 Early shooting put more focus on the pool playing , but during filming <unk> made the decision to place more emphasis on the love story between Newman and Laurie 's characters . Despite the change in emphasis , <unk> still used the various pool games to show the strengthening of Eddie 's character and the evolution of his relationship to Bert and Sarah , through the positioning of the characters in the frame . For example , when Eddie is playing <unk> , Eddie is positioned below Bert in a two shot but above <unk> while still below Bert in a three shot . When Sarah enters the room , she is below Eddie in two shot while in a three shot Eddie is still below Bert . When Eddie is kneeling over Sarah 's body , Bert again appears above him but Eddie attacks Bert , ending up on top of him . Eddie finally appears above Bert in two shot when Eddie returns to beat <unk> . 
 The <unk> is fundamentally a story of what it means to be a human being , <unk> within the context of winning and losing . Describing the film , Robert <unk> said : " My protagonist , Fast Eddie , wants to become a great pool player , but the film is really about the obstacles he encounters in attempting to fulfill himself as a human being . He <unk> self @-@ awareness only after a terrible personal tragedy which he has caused — and then he wins his pool game . " Roger <unk> <unk> with this assessment , citing The <unk> as " one of the few American movies in which the hero wins by surrendering , by accepting reality instead of his dreams . " 
 The film was also somewhat autobiographical for <unk> , relating to his dealings with the House Un @-@ American Activities Committee . A screenwriter during the 1930s and ' 40s , he had been involved with the Communist Party in the 1930s and refused to name names at his first <unk> appearance . Ultimately he changed his mind and identified friends and colleagues as party members . Similarly , <unk> sells his soul and betrays the one person who really knows and loves him in a <unk> pact to gain character . 
 The <unk> had its world premiere in Washington , D.C. on September 25 , 1961 . Prior to the premiere , Richard Burton hosted a midnight screening of the film for the casts of the season 's Broadway shows , which generated a great deal of positive word of mouth . Initially reluctant to publicize the film , 20th Century Fox responded by stepping up its promotional activities . 
 The <unk> received nine Academy Award nominations . The film won two , for Best Art Direction @-@ Set Decoration , Black @-@ and @-@ White ( Harry Horner and Gene <unk> ) and Best <unk> , Black @-@ and @-@ White ( <unk> <unk> ) . The film was also nominated for Best Picture and Newman was nominated for Best Actor in a Leading Role . Gleason and Scott were both nominated for Best Actor in a Supporting Role ; Scott refused the nomination . Laurie was nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role . <unk> received nominations for Best Director and , with Carroll , for Best Writing , Screenplay Based on Material from Another <unk> . 
 Newman was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor . Gleason and Scott were each nominated for Best Supporting Actor and Scott was also nominated as Best New Star of the Year . At the 1962 BAFTA Awards , The <unk> tied with the Soviet film Ballad of a Soldier for Best Film from Any Source . Newman won for Best Foreign Actor and Piper Laurie was nominated for Best Foreign Actress . Gleason was honored as Best Supporting Actor by the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures and the film was named among the Board 's ten best films of 1961 . <unk> was named Best Director by the New York Film Critics Circle Awards and <unk> and Carroll shared the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written Drama . 
 In the decades since its release , The <unk> has cemented its reputation as a classic . Roger <unk> , echoing earlier praise for the performances , direction , and cinematography and adding <unk> for editor <unk> Allen , cites the film as " one of those films where scenes have such psychic weight that they grow in our memories . " He further cites Fast Eddie <unk> as one of " only a handful of movie characters so real that the audience refers to them as <unk> . " TV Guide calls the film a " dark <unk> " offering " a <unk> world whose only bright spot is the top of the pool table , yet [ with ] characters [ who ] maintain a <unk> nobility and grace . " The four leads are again lavishly praised for their performances and the film is summed up as " not to be missed . " 
 Paul Newman reprised his role as Fast Eddie <unk> in the 1986 film The Color of Money , for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role . A number of observers and critics have suggested that this Oscar was in <unk> recognition for his performance in The <unk> . In 1997 , the Library of Congress selected The <unk> for preservation in the United States National Film <unk> as " culturally , historically , or <unk> significant . " Carroll and <unk> 's screenplay was selected by the Writers Guild of America in 2006 as the <unk> best motion picture screenplay of all time . In June 2008 , <unk> released its " Ten top Ten " — the best ten films in ten " classic " American film genres — after polling over 1 @,@ 500 people from the creative community . The <unk> was acknowledged as the sixth best film in the sports genre . 
 William McGregor ( 13 April 1846 – 20 December 1911 ) was a Scottish association football administrator in the Victorian era who is regarded as the founder of the Football League , the first organised association football league in the world . 
 After moving from <unk> to Birmingham to set up business as a <unk> , McGregor became involved with local football club Aston Villa , which he helped to establish as one of the leading teams in England . He served the club for over 20 years in various capacities , including president , director and chairman . In 1888 , frustrated by the regular cancellation of Villa 's matches , McGregor organised a meeting of representatives of England 's leading clubs , which led to the formation of the Football League , giving member clubs a guaranteed fixture list each season . This was instrumental in the transition of football from an amateur <unk> to a professional business . 
 McGregor served as both chairman and president of the Football League and was also chairman of The Football Association ( the FA ) . He was recognised by the FA for his service to the game shortly before his death in 1911 , and was posthumously honoured by the local football authorities and Aston Villa . 
 Born in <unk> in <unk> , Scotland , McGregor first became interested in football after watching a match between locals and visiting artisans at <unk> . He served an apprenticeship as a <unk> in Perth , and in 1870 , following the example of his brother Peter , moved to Birmingham , and opened his own <unk> business in Aston , an area just outside the city . Upon his arrival in the English Midlands he became involved with a local football club , <unk> , which had been formed by a fellow <unk> , Campbell <unk> . McGregor was enthusiastic enough about the game to arrange for his shop to close early on Saturdays to allow him to watch matches , and he later sold football kits at the shop , which became a popular meeting place for football enthusiasts . 
 McGregor was married to <unk> , and the couple had a daughter and a son , also named <unk> and William . A <unk> , McGregor was a supporter of the <unk> movement , and was active in the local branch of the Liberal Party until his membership <unk> in 1882 due to the increasing amount of time he devoted to football . He was involved in the early attempts to establish a baseball league in the United Kingdom , and served as the honorary treasurer of the Baseball Association of Great Britain and Ireland . Despite his commitment to sport , he held desperately on to his <unk> business throughout his life . 
 McGregor was a committed Christian who was widely respected for his honesty and integrity . He worshipped for forty years at the Congregational church in Wheeler Street , Aston . His pastor , the <unk> . <unk> Percival said that the best thing about him " was not so much the <unk> , kindly , honest <unk> , but the Christian behind it all " . He described him as " a man of absolutely <unk> personal character " . 
 In 1877 , McGregor was invited to become a committee member of Aston Villa , a football club formed three years earlier . He also <unk> matches for the club . At the time the club played at Aston Park , close to the premises of McGregor 's business . He became interested in joining Villa due to the strong Scottish contingent in the club 's ranks , the team 's exciting style of play , and the club 's connection to a <unk> Chapel . He quickly assumed the post of club administrator , helping the <unk> club to survive its financial troubles . After some of Aston Villa 's possessions were seized by <unk> , McGregor allowed the club to use his shop as a store to prevent further <unk> . Under McGregor 's leadership , Aston Villa won their first trophy , the Birmingham Senior Cup , in 1880 , shortly after which McGregor became the club 's president . 
 The following year McGregor became a member of the club 's board of directors . Villa 's standing within the game continued to grow , and in 1887 the club became the first from the Midlands to win the FA Cup , defeating local rivals West Bromwich Albion in the final . In 1895 , McGregor became vice @-@ chairman , and went on to become the club 's chairman in 1897 . During his time at the club he was noted for his <unk> skills and ambition , and was responsible for adopting the lion rampant depicted on the Royal Standard of Scotland , as the club 's crest . 
 As the 1880s progressed , the balance of power within English football began to change . The first national competition , the FA Cup , had previously been dominated by amateur clubs from privileged backgrounds , such as Wanderers and Old <unk> . However the 1883 FA Cup Final saw the first victory by a working @-@ class team , Blackburn Olympic . At this time professionalism was not permitted . <unk> from urban areas in the north were strong advocates of the practice , but the southern amateur teams and the FA authorities were firmly opposed . Though not initially an advocate of professionalism , McGregor came to favour its introduction . By 1885 the issue threatened to split the FA when a group of clubs , predominantly from Lancashire , announced their intention to leave and form a rival British Football Association if professionalism was not accepted . An emergency FA conference was called in response . Representing Aston Villa , McGregor spoke in favour of professionalism , the only delegate from the Midlands to do so , and was one of the few delegates to admit that his club had been paying players . Though not as outspoken as stronger proponents , such as Preston North End 's William <unk> , McGregor was well respected . The conference ended with the FA accepting professionalism , although each club was permitted only to pay players who had been born or lived for at least two years within six miles of its home stadium . 
 <unk> brought fresh complications for club administrators . Many friendlies were cancelled due to opponents ' FA Cup or county cup matches taking precedence or clubs simply failing to honour a fixture in favour of a more lucrative match elsewhere . This made it hard for the clubs to pay players ' wages on a regular basis . McGregor took action after seeing Villa matches cancelled , to the increasing frustration of the club 's fans , on five consecutive Saturdays . On 2 March 1888 , he wrote to the committee of his own club , Aston Villa , as well as to those of Blackburn Rovers , Bolton Wanderers , Preston North End and West Bromwich Albion , suggesting the creation of a league competition that would provide a number of guaranteed fixtures for its member clubs each season . Corinthian F.C. founder N. Lane Jackson , writing in 1899 , stated that McGregor took his inspiration from the existing league set @-@ up used in American baseball , although McGregor himself cited the County Cricket Championship as his inspiration . McGregor 's letter to the clubs read : 
 Every year it is becoming more and more difficult for football clubs of any standing to meet their friendly engagements and even arrange friendly matches . The consequence is that at the last moment , through cup @-@ tie interference , clubs are compelled to take on teams who will not attract the public . 
 I beg to tender the following suggestion as a means of getting over the difficulty : that ten or twelve of the most prominent clubs in England combine to arrange home @-@ and @-@ away fixtures each season , the said fixtures to be arranged at a friendly conference about the same time as the International Conference . 
 This combination might be known as the Association Football Union , and could be managed by representative from each club . Of course , this is in no way to interfere with the National Association ; even the suggested matches might be played under cup @-@ tie rules . However , this is a detail . 
 My object in writing to you at present is merely to draw your attention to the subject , and to suggest a friendly conference to discuss the matter more fully . I would take it as a favour if you would kindly think the matter over , and make whatever suggestions you deem necessary . I am only writing to the following – Blackburn Rovers , Bolton Wanderers , Preston North End , West Bromwich Albion , and Aston Villa , and would like to hear what other clubs you would suggest . 
 <unk> How would Friday , 23 March 1888 , suit for the friendly conference at <unk> 's Hotel , London ? 
 McGregor chose 23 March as the date of his proposed meeting because it was the day before the FA Cup final and representatives of the country 's top clubs would be in London . Representatives from ten clubs attended , including the FA Cup finalists West Bromwich Albion and Preston North End , but it quickly became clear that clubs from the South of England were not interested in McGregor 's proposal and none attended . A second meeting was held in Manchester on 17 April , and details concerning the new competition were finalised . McGregor 's suggested name for the competition , " The Association Football Union " was rejected as too similar to that of the Rugby Football Union and " The Football League " was chosen , despite McGregor 's opposition on the grounds that he felt it might <unk> associations with the unpopular Irish Land League . The term English League was avoided , to leave the possibility of future applications from Scottish clubs . McGregor also proposed a rule that only one club from each town should be included . The other founders agreed to this rule , which caused controversy , as it meant Birmingham team Mitchell St. George 's were denied membership in favour of McGregor 's Aston Villa . Twelve clubs kicked off the first season of League football in September 1888 . 
 McGregor served as the first chairman of the League 's Management Committee . One of the committee 's main jobs was handling issues of discipline , but committee members were not barred from involvement in decisions involving their own clubs . In fact , the first disciplinary meeting saw fines issued to three of the four clubs with representatives on the committee . McGregor was re @-@ elected unopposed in 1891 . Earlier he had spoken of his pleasure that " of the 132 matches in which the League clubs have taken part and in which about 300 players have taken the field , not a single fatal accident has to be recorded " . A year later he oversaw the expansion of the Football League into two divisions when the rival Football Alliance was merged into the competition , but he relinquished his post later that year due to ill health , which caused him to miss meetings . 
 After stepping down as chairman , he was unanimously elected to an honorary position of president , a role he kept until 1894 , and was named the first @-@ ever life member of the League in 1895 . The role was that of a <unk> with little actual authority , but he was used as a mediator to resolve league disagreements . In the second half of the decade McGregor 's failure to attend many committee meetings led to criticism from John Bentley , his successor as president . Bentley 's criticism achieved the desired effect ; from 1899 until his health deteriorated in 1910 , McGregor seldom missed a meeting . During this period McGregor was noted for his reserved nature . He was silent for large parts of committee meetings , but would contribute enthusiastically on the occasions he felt his input was necessary . 
 Between 1888 and 1894 McGregor also served as chairman of The Football Association ( the FA ) , English football 's overall governing body , which had existed since 1863 . He became known as a football celebrity , writing a weekly column for the Birmingham Gazette and <unk> products such as <unk> , and a type of football boot which the manufacturer billed as the " McGregor <unk> @-@ to @-@ toe boot " . Though he held many different administrative posts in his lifetime , McGregor never played the sport competitively ; his only on @-@ pitch involvement was occasional <unk> during Aston Villa practices in the 1870s . 
 Although McGregor envisaged the League as a friendly union , within which clubs would share ticket revenues and work together in their mutual best interests , the immediate effect of its creation was that football came to be treated as a business for the first time , as opposed to something that players and officials simply regarded as a <unk> . All the clubs involved experienced significant increases in their turnover , which at Aston Villa , McGregor 's own club , increased more than <unk> between 1889 and 1899 . The wages paid to players , however , remained low due to restrictions imposed by the FA , so clubs were able to use their increased profitability to build larger stadiums and accommodate ever larger crowds of spectators . Although the League initially contained a small number of clubs , all of which were based in the northern half of the country , by the early years of the twentieth century it included clubs from all parts of England . At its peak nearly 100 clubs played in the Football League , and it remained the pre @-@ eminent competition in English football until the 1990s , when the top clubs broke away to form the Premier League . In keeping with McGregor 's views on mutual support and co @-@ operation , gate receipts were shared amongst the clubs until the 1980s , which helped to ensure that a select few wealthy clubs were not able to dominate the competition . McGregor himself had little interest in the business aspect of football , and was adamant that the Football League should not challenge the longstanding authority of the FA . The success of the Football League directly inspired the creation of similar competitions in other countries , beginning with Scotland , where the Scottish Football League was formed in 1890 . 
 In May 1910 , McGregor was taken ill and later confined to a nursing home . His condition worsened towards the end of 1911 . His last public appearance was a committee meeting on 4 December , and he underwent an operation on 19 December . However , after a brief improvement in his condition he relapsed and died the following day . Although a devout <unk> , he is buried in the grounds of a Church of England church , St. Mary 's , in the <unk> district of Birmingham , alongside his wife , who died in 1908 . McGregor is remembered as the " father of The Football League " , an Aston Villa legend , and a legend of football in general . 
 Shortly before his death , the FA presented McGregor , who was at that time a vice @-@ president of the association , with a long service medal . After his death , Aston Villa dedicated a bed in the children 's ward of one of Birmingham 's hospitals in his honour , and the Birmingham County Football Association unveiled a commemorative drinking fountain , which is now preserved at Villa Park , current home of his former club . In the modern era , Aston Villa selected him as one of the twelve inaugural members of its Hall of Fame , and named a hospitality suite at Villa Park after him . In 2008 , the Aston Villa Supporters ' Trust announced plans to further honour him with a bronze statue outside the stadium . The statue , by sculptor Sam Holland , is displayed outside the Directors ' Entrance of the Trinity Road Stand , and was unveiled on 28 November 2009 . The Trust also raised £ 1 @,@ 000 to restore and <unk> McGregor 's grave in 2011 . 
 Buenos Aires , the capital of Argentina , has a temperate climate , which is classified as a humid subtropical climate ( <unk> ) under the Köppen climate classification with four distinct seasons . <unk> are hot and humid with frequent thunderstorms while winters are cool and drier with <unk> that occurs on average twice per year . Spring and fall are transition seasons characterized by changeable weather . At the central observatory , the highest recorded temperature is 43 @.@ 3 ° C ( 109 @.@ 9 ° F ) while the lowest recorded temperature is − 5 @.@ 4 ° C ( 22 @.@ 3 ° F ) . 
 Different climatic factors influence the climate of Buenos Aires . The semi – permanent South Atlantic High influences its climate throughout the year by bringing in moist winds from the northeast , which bring most of the precipitation to the city in the form of frontal systems during winter or storms produced by cyclogenesis in autumn and winter . The hot temperatures and high <unk> in the summer months form a low pressure system called the <unk> Low over northern Argentina , generating a pressure gradient that brings moist easterly winds to the city – because of this , summer is the <unk> season . In contrast , this low pressure system weakens in the winter , which combined with strong <unk> winds results in a drier season due to weaker easterly winds . Being located in the Pampas , Buenos Aires has variable weather due to the passage of contrasting air mass – the cold , dry <unk> from the south and warm , humid tropical air from the north . The coastal location results in a strong maritime influence , causing extreme temperatures ( hot or cold ) to be rare . 
 Buenos Aires is located in the humid subtropical climate zone ( Köppen climate classification : <unk> ) . Due to the maritime influences from the adjoining Atlantic Ocean , its climate is temperate with extreme temperatures ( both hot and cold ) being rare . Thus , cold air coming directly from the south are moderated by the Atlantic Ocean and warmer than winds from the southwest ( which are not moderated by it ) . 
 The climate of Buenos Aires is dominated by the semi – permanent South Atlantic High throughout the year . This brings in moist winds from the northeast , which brings most of the precipitation to the city . During winter , it brings in frontal systems responsible for precipitation in the city . In autumn and summer , it produces storms that are generally located north of the city and produces strong winds from the south or southeast that can occasionally lead to the swelling of the <unk> de la Plata , flooding coastal areas . The South Pacific High is the origin of polar air masses that are responsible for the coldest temperatures and result in clear and very dry conditions . These air masses originate from the South Pacific high and move in a northeastern direction during winter towards Buenos Aires by passing . Although it is polar maritime ( this is a cool , moist air mass that forms from oceans located in the <unk> and <unk> regions at the southern tip of South America ) , it becomes modified as it passes over the South American continent , becoming drier as it arrives at Buenos Aires . This is because as the cold air masses from the South Pacific High move over the Pacific Ocean and the Andes and reach the land south of <unk> ( where the Andes are shorter in height ) , <unk> leads to the formation of a strong high pressure system in the center of the country ( at around <unk> ) . This high pressure system brings cold and dry , polar continental air masses to Buenos Aires . Cold fronts are more common during winter than in summer as the South Atlantic and South Pacific highs are at their southernmost positions during summer , making it difficult for cold fronts to enter . 
 The urban heat island makes the city warmer than suburban and rural areas . On average , Buenos Aires is warmer than the surrounding areas by 1 @.@ 5 to 3 @.@ 5 ° C ( 2 @.@ 7 to 6 @.@ 3 ° F ) owing to the urban heat island . The average heat island is in summer than in winter . This varies by season ; its influence during the day is the strongest in July than in January . In contrast , the urban heat island effect during nights is the most intense in January than in July . 
 The El Niño – Southern <unk> is a major factor in the variation of annual precipitation within Buenos Aires and the Pampas , particularly during spring and summer . During an El Niño year , precipitation is higher , with a significant increase in precipitation from November to January . In contrast , La <unk> years are associated with lower precipitation ; precipitation is below average during October – December . 
 Springs in Buenos Aires are typically mild during the day with cool to cold nights . The average high is 22 @.@ 5 ° C ( 72 @.@ 5 ° F ) while the average low is 13 @.@ 2 ° C ( 55 @.@ 8 ° F ) . It is one of the <unk> seasons in the city , averaging 316 @.@ 5 mm ( 12 @.@ 46 in ) of precipitation and 28 days with measurable precipitation . Nonetheless , most precipitation events are short in duration . 
 Spring is characterized by changeable weather with temperatures that can <unk> . Cold polar air from the south can bring cooler temperatures . An extreme example of this was in November 2007 , when cold polar air from the south brought temperatures down to 2 @.@ 5 ° C ( 36 @.@ 5 ° F ) on the morning of November 15 . The same polar air affected many parts of the country , bringing cold temperatures and snow in coastal parts of <unk> . In contrast , hot humid air from the north produces <unk> days ; the highest temperature recorded in spring is 36 @.@ 8 ° C ( 98 @.@ 2 ° F ) on 27 November 1955 . In some cases , heat waves , can occur , particularly in November . 
 <unk> are hot and humid . On average , mornings and <unk> are hot whereas temperatures drop considerably at night . The average high is 29 @.@ 1 ° C ( 84 @.@ 4 ° F ) while the average low is 19 @.@ 3 ° C ( 66 @.@ 7 ° F ) . With a mean precipitation of 384 @.@ 8 mm ( 15 @.@ 15 in ) , it is the <unk> season . This is due to hot temperatures and high <unk> that lead to the development of a low pressure system called the <unk> Low situated over northern Argentina that interacts with the South Atlantic High to generate a pressure gradient that brings moist easterly winds to the region , favouring precipitation , which mostly occurs in the form of convective thunderstorms . The <unk> Low also interacts with the South Atlantic high to bring warm and tropical air from the north which is the strongest in summer when the <unk> Low is at its strongest due to higher <unk> . 
 Heat waves are a common feature of summers in the city . These heat waves place extra demand on electricity usage , leading to shortages . In extreme cases , these power shortages during heat waves can cause traffic jams and protests , such as the December 2013 heat wave ( longest heat wave ever recorded in Buenos Aires ) where increased energy demand lead to energy shortages and power cuts , protests against the government over the lack of service , and traffic jams as a result of these protests . However , most heat waves are of short duration ( usually less than a week ) , and are followed by the passage of the cold , dry <unk> wind , which brings violent and intense thunderstorms with strong gusts and hail followed by cooler temperatures and lower humidity . Occasionally , a tornado can form , which can strike the city although most tornadoes are relatively weak and rarely cause deaths . The greatest risk for tornadoes occurs in the summer season due to the favourable conditions . These severe storms can damage cars , houses and disrupt public services such as transportation and collection and disposal of urban solid waste . 
 At the beginning of autumn , temperatures are warm to hot in the afternoon while nights and mornings are mild . Later on in the season , conditions are cooler featuring mild <unk> , and cold nights and mornings . The average high and low are 23 @.@ 0 ° C ( 73 @.@ 4 ° F ) and 14 @.@ 0 ° C ( 57 @.@ 2 ° F ) respectively while precipitation averages <unk> @.@ 4 mm ( 13 @.@ 83 in ) during this season . Similar to spring , the season is characterized by changeable weather conditions with temperatures that can <unk> ; temperatures as high as 37 @.@ 9 ° C ( 100 @.@ 2 ° F ) and as low as − 4 @.@ 0 ° C ( 24 @.@ 8 ° F ) have been recorded . <unk> of rainy weather occur although these are usually of short duration . <unk> rarely occur , though they can occur as early as May . 
 June to August are the winter months in Buenos Aires . Winters are cold with mild temperatures during the day and cold nights . <unk> during the season average 16 @.@ 3 ° C ( 61 @.@ 3 ° F ) while lows average 8 @.@ 1 ° C ( 46 @.@ 6 ° F ) . <unk> rarely drop below 0 ° C ( 32 @.@ 0 ° F ) , averaging 2 days each year at the central observatory , and 1 day at <unk> . Cold waves can occur in these months in which periods of cold temperatures can persist for days . These cold waves , particularly during severe winters lead to increases in energy demand , which can cause significant energy shortages . <unk> occasionally occurs in the surrounding areas of the city but rarely within Buenos Aires proper ; since the start of meteorological observations in 1906 at the central observatory , snowfall has only been observed <unk> : on 9 July 2007 during a winter storm , June 1918 , and July 1928 . This is due to the city center having higher temperatures than the surrounding areas owing to the urban heat island effect . 
 Most of the precipitation comes from frontal systems associated with cyclogenesis and strong southeasterly winds ( <unk> ) , which bring long periods of precipitation , cloudy weather and cooler temperatures . Winters are cloudy while relative humidity is very high , often 90 % or higher , making the weather dull , grey and cool . Occasionally , warm air masses from the north bring warmer temperatures . These warm air masses can bring sunny weather , particularly during the afternoon when they come from the north or northwest as a result of a trough located in central Argentina . On the other hand , warm air masses from Brazil bring humid conditions , featuring high humidity with high cloud cover that is typical of a warm front of a frontal system and typical of tropical maritime air . These warm air masses that are responsible for the high humidity and cloud cover are the <unk> air masses , leading to the <unk> temperatures . Nonetheless , these are short lived as the <unk> Low , which is responsible for bringing in warm and tropical air from the north is weaker in winter due to lower <unk> , leading to the winds from the north being less intense and shorter lived . 
 Towards the end of winter in August , there are important changes in the atmospheric circulation . Warm , humid air <unk> the city , higher solar radiation and frequent <unk> weather disturbances from the west occur during the end of the winter . As such , the end of winter is usually characterized by heavy storms with lightning . This is popularly known as the Santa Rosa Storm , around August 30 . Based on 107 years of weather observations ( 1906 – 2012 ) from the central observatory , 58 years have seen <unk> weather occurring on days close to August 30 , although not all of these have led to heavy precipitation . 
 According to the central observatory , which has one of the most reliable and oldest records in South America , the highest temperature in Buenos Aires , 43 @.@ 3 ° C ( 109 @.@ 9 ° F ) , was recorded on 29 January 1957 while the lowest temperature recorded is − 5 @.@ 4 ° C ( 22 @.@ 3 ° F ) on 9 July 1918 . The <unk> year on record is 2015 , with a mean annual temperature of 18 @.@ 6 ° C ( 65 @.@ 5 ° F ) . On the other hand , 1911 was the coldest year , with a mean annual temperature of 15 @.@ 4 ° C ( 59 @.@ 7 ° F ) . 
 The year with the maximum precipitation was 1900 , when the city received 2 @,@ <unk> mm ( 79 @.@ 7 in ) of precipitation . On the other hand , 1916 has been the <unk> year , with a mean annual precipitation of <unk> mm ( 19 @.@ 8 in ) . The highest precipitation for a single day was recorded on 27 February 1930 , when 194 @.@ 1 mm ( 7 @.@ 64 in ) of precipitation fell . 
 The early <unk> were a range of tall , commercial buildings built between 1884 and 1939 , predominantly in the American cities of New York and Chicago . Cities in the United States were traditionally made up of low @-@ rise buildings , but significant economic growth after the Civil War and increasingly intensive use of urban land encouraged the development of taller buildings beginning in the 1870s . <unk> improvements enabled the construction of <unk> iron @-@ framed structures with deep foundations , equipped with new inventions such as the elevator and electric lighting . These made it both technically and commercially viable to build a new class of taller buildings , the first of which , Chicago 's 138 @-@ foot ( 42 m ) tall Home Insurance Building , opened in 1884 . Their numbers grew rapidly and by 1888 they were being labelled <unk> . 
 Chicago initially led the way in skyscraper design , with many constructed in the center of the financial district during the late 1880s and early 1890s . Sometimes termed the products of the Chicago school of architecture , these <unk> attempted to balance aesthetic concerns with practical commercial design , producing large , square <unk> @-@ styled buildings hosting shops and restaurants on the ground level and containing <unk> offices on the upper floors . In contrast , New York 's <unk> were frequently narrower towers which , more eclectic in style , were often criticized for their lack of <unk> . In 1892 , Chicago banned the construction of new <unk> taller than 150 feet ( 46 m ) , leaving the development of taller buildings to New York . 
 The first decade of the 20th century saw a new wave of skyscraper construction . The demand for new office space to hold America 's expanding workforce of white @-@ collar staff continued to grow . Engineering developments made it easier to build and live in yet taller buildings . Chicago built new <unk> in its existing style , while New York experimented further with tower design . <unk> buildings such as the <unk> were followed by the 612 @-@ foot ( 187 m ) tall Singer Tower , the 700 @-@ foot ( 210 m ) Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower and the <unk> @-@ foot ( 241 m ) <unk> Building . Though these <unk> were commercial successes , criticism mounted as they broke up the ordered city skyline and plunged neighboring streets and buildings into perpetual shadow . Combined with an economic downturn , this led to the introduction of <unk> restraints in New York in 1916 . 
 Early <unk> emerged in the US as a result of economic growth , the financial organization of American businesses , and the intensive use of land . New York was one of the centers of early skyscraper construction , and had a history as a key seaport located on the small island of Manhattan , on the east coast of the US . As a consequence of its colonial history , New York real estate was broken up into many small <unk> of land , with few large sites . During the first half of the 19th century it became the national center of American finance , and the banks in the financial district of Wall Street competed fiercely with English institutions for international dominance . 
 The Great Fire of 1835 destroyed most of the old financial buildings , and in their place a wide variety of new buildings were erected and demolished in quick succession during the 1840s and 1850s ; traveler Philip <unk> suggested that the entire city was being rebuilt every decade . Most buildings adopted the Italian Renaissance inspired <unk> @-@ style of architecture popular amongst their rivals in England , and rose no more than five or six stories . New York did not have any restrictions on the height of buildings but in practice low @-@ rise buildings were the norm , at least until 1865 , with the tallest buildings being the city 's churches . New York 's population <unk> between 1840 and 1870 , and property values soared , increasing by more than 90 percent between 1860 and 1875 . 
 Further west , the city of Chicago became the other major site in the development of early <unk> . In contrast to New York , Chicago emerged as a major metropolis only in the mid @-@ 19th century , growing from a village of around fifty inhabitants in 1830 , to a city of 30 @,@ 000 in 1850 and nearly 300 @,@ 000 by 1870 . Chicago became the railroad hub for the American West and the primary trading city for the emerging territories , famous for its commercial culture . It saw itself as different from the cities on the east coast and was immensely proud of its status as a growing , vibrant center . 
 By the 1870s Chicago had become the main financial center for the West , but in October 1871 the Great Chicago Fire destroyed the wooden heart of the city . The city was rebuilt on large plots of land in a new grid network , and followed new city <unk> that prohibited construction in wood . These factors encouraged the building of taller properties in new innovative designs , which , like New York , saw a range of businesses and services being packed into single buildings . 
 The construction of taller buildings during the 1870s was hindered by the financial Panic of 1873 and the ensuing economic depression , which lasted until around 1879 . Construction slowed and property values <unk> . By 1880 , however , the recovery was well underway , with new builds in New York returning to the pace of 1871 , and the economic <unk> making the construction of taller buildings an attractive financial option again , establishing many of the <unk> for the development of the skyscraper . 
 The emergence of <unk> was made possible by technological improvements during the middle of the 19th century . One of these developments was the iron framed building . Traditional buildings supported their internal floors through their walls , but the taller the building , the thicker the walls had to become , particularly at the base : buildings of any substantial height rapidly saw their lower floors eaten up by brick or masonry . In the 1860s French engineers experimented with using built @-@ up plate <unk> made of wrought iron to construct buildings supported by internal metal frames . These frames were stronger than traditional masonry and permitted much thinner walls . The methodology was extensively described in engineering journals and was initially used to build warehouses . 
 Using these metal frames for taller buildings , however , meant exposing them to the potentially devastating effects of wind pressure . As a consequence , protective wind <unk> had to be introduced , enabled by the work of Augustin @-@ Jean Fresnel who produced <unk> for <unk> the loads and moments on larger buildings . Metal @-@ framed buildings were also particularly vulnerable to fire and required special <unk> . French engineers had made advances in this area in the early 19th century , but major <unk> only came with the work of architect Peter Wight in the 1860s . <unk> on by the catastrophic fires in Chicago in 1871 and Boston in 1872 , his findings were turned into a wide variety of patented fire <unk> products during the 1870s . 
 <unk> , heavier buildings such as <unk> also required stronger foundations than smaller buildings . Earlier buildings had typically rested their foundations on rubble , which was in turn laid down on the soft top layer of the ground called the <unk> . As buildings became taller and heavier , the <unk> could not support their weight and foundations increasingly needed to rest directly on the bedrock below . In both New York and Chicago this required digging down a considerable distance through soft and often @-@ <unk> soil , <unk> the hole filling up with water before the foundations were complete . The deeper the foundations needed to be , the greater the challenge . Special water @-@ tight boxes called <unk> were invented to deal with this problem in England in 1830 , and adopted in the US during the 1850s and 1860s . 
 The development of the elevator was also essential to the emergence of the early <unk> , as office building taller than around six stories would have been impractical without them . <unk> <unk> were first installed in England during the 1830s and spread to US factories and hotels by the 1840s . <unk> using hoist ropes , however , could only function effectively in low @-@ rise buildings and this limitation encouraged the introduction of the hydraulic elevator in 1870 , even though early models contained dangerous design flaws . By 1876 these problems had been resolved , providing a solution for <unk> the early <unk> . 
 New environmental technologies in heating , lighting , ventilation and sanitation were also critical to creating taller buildings that were attractive to work in . Central heating could not be easily extended to serve larger buildings ; in the 1850s , a system using low @-@ pressure steam and steam @-@ operated fans became adopted in the construction of the later <unk> . Many US buildings were lit by gas but this carried safety risks and was difficult to install in taller buildings . As an alternative , electric lights were installed from 1878 onwards , powered by basement generators . <unk> was also a challenge , as smoke drifting into offices from the streets and the fumes from the gas lighting made air quality a major health issue . A steam @-@ driven , forced @-@ draft ventilation system was invented in 1860 and became widely used in taller buildings by the 1870s , overcoming much of the problem . <unk> in iron <unk> permitted running hot and cold water and sanitation facilities to be installed throughout taller buildings for the first time . 
 There is academic disagreement over which building should be considered the first skyscraper . The term was first used in the <unk> to describe a particularly tall horse , before later being applied to the sail at the top of a ship 's mast , tall hats and <unk> , tall men and a ball that was hit high into the air . In the 1880s it began to be applied to buildings , first in 1883 to describe large public monuments and then in 1889 as a label for tall office blocks , coming into widespread use over the next decade . <unk> the first " true skyscraper " is not straightforward , and various candidates exist depending on the criteria applied . George Post 's New York <unk> Life Building of 1870 , for example , was the first tall office building to use the elevator , while his <unk> Exchange of 1884 made substantial structural advances in metal frame design . The Home Insurance Building in Chicago , opened in 1884 , is , however , most often labelled the first skyscraper because of its innovative use of structural steel in a metal frame design . 
 The Home Insurance Building was a 138 @-@ foot ( 42 m ) tall , 10 @-@ story skyscraper designed by William Le Baron <unk> , who had been trained as an engineer in France and was a leading architect in Chicago . <unk> 's design was unusual in that it incorporated steel into the building 's internal metal frame alongside the traditional wrought iron . This frame took the weight of the floors of the building and helped to support the weight of the external walls as well , proving an important step towards creating the genuine non @-@ structural curtain walls that became a feature of later <unk> . The design was not perfect – some of the weight was still carried by masonry walls , and the metal frame was <unk> , rather than riveted , together – but it was clearly a significant advance in tall building construction . 
 The approach quickly caught on in Chicago . In 1889 the <unk> Building replaced the <unk> metal design with a stronger , riveted approach , and Chicago 's Chamber of Commerce Building introduced interior light courts to the structural design of <unk> . In the 1890 Rand <unk> Building the last remaining technical issues were resolved , resulting in the first entirely self @-@ supporting , steel @-@ framed skyscraper . Some buildings , such as The <unk> and the <unk> Building , combined elements of both the newer and older styles , but generally Chicago rapidly adopted steel structures as a flexible and effective way to produce a range of tall buildings . <unk> professional structural engineers began to establish practices in Chicago specialising in the steel frames need for the new skyscraper . 
 Technical challenges overcome , there was a boom in skyscraper construction in Chicago from 1888 onwards , the city leading the way in the new form . By 1893 , Chicago had built 12 <unk> between 16 and 20 stories tall , tightly clustered in the centre of the financial district . Chicago 's <unk> , however , were constrained by the contemporary limits of steel @-@ frame design and the muddy sub @-@ soil in the city , which together limited most of their <unk> to around 16 or 17 stories . Chicago 's <unk> rapidly became tourist destinations , for the views of the wider city they provided from their upper floors and as attractive sites in their own right . <unk> were advised to hire <unk> for street tours of the <unk> – by lying back in the cab , they would be able to safely take in the tops of the tall buildings . 
 In comparison , New York trailed behind Chicago , having only four buildings over 16 stories tall by 1893 . Part of the delay was caused by the <unk> of the city authorities to authorize metal @-@ frame construction techniques ; it was not until 1889 that they relented and allowed Bradford Gilbert to construct the Tower Building , an 11 @-@ story iron @-@ framed skyscraper . This encouraged the building of more skyscraper towers in New York , although the city remained cautious about the technology for some years . Finally , in 1895 a breakthrough was made with the construction of the American <unk> Building , a twenty @-@ story , <unk> @-@ foot ( 92 m ) high @-@ steel development that broke Chicago 's height record . From then on , New York thoroughly embraced skeleton frame construction . In particular , New York newspaper companies adopted the skyscraper , building several along Park Row , sometimes termed " Newspaper Row " , in the 1880s and 1890s . A few early <unk> were also constructed in Baltimore , Boston , Pittsburgh , St. Louis , and Buffalo , including the Wainwright and the <unk> Buildings . Early examples on the West Coast include the Old Chronicle Building and the Call Building in San Francisco , as well as the Luzon Building in <unk> , Washington . 
 The architects of early <unk> faced a number of challenges . The most fashionable architectural style in the late 19th century was the French <unk> @-@ Arts movement , sometimes termed the Italian Renaissance style , which applied Classical aesthetic principles to modern buildings . American architects trained in the <unk> @-@ Arts style at the Parisian <unk> des <unk> @-@ Arts began to return home in the 1880s , bringing these ideals and standards with them . Applying contemporary <unk> @-@ Arts standards to early <unk> , however , was not straightforward . The buildings that the <unk> @-@ Arts movement <unk> and built were typically much shorter and broader than any skyscraper , and it was impossible to accurately reproduce the style in a tall , narrow building . 
 <unk> were also primarily commercial buildings , and economics as well as aesthetics had to play an important part in their design . The architectural writer <unk> <unk> noted in 1893 that " current American architecture is not a matter of art , but of business . A building must pay , or there will be no <unk> ready with the money to meet its cost . This is at once the curse and the glory of American architecture . " George Hill echoed the theme , condemning unnecessary features on the basis that " every cubic foot that is used for purely ornamental purposes beyond that needed to express its use and to make it <unk> with others of its class , is a waste " . 
 By the 1890s , Chicago architects were producing a solution to this problem , creating a new architectural style , often termed the " Chicago school of architecture " . The school included architects such as Louis Sullivan , William Le Baron <unk> and John Root , whose designs combined architectural aesthetic theory with practical commercial sense . They favoured placing rich , ornate designs on the outside of <unk> at the ground level and simpler , <unk> ornamentation on the upper levels , with strong vertical lines . The roofs of their <unk> typically formed a <unk> outline and structure when seen at a distance as part of the city skyline . The intent was to draw the observer 's eye upwards , celebrating what Sullivan termed the " <unk> " nature of the skyscraper , but not wasting resources on intricate detailing unlikely to appeal to a busy businessman . At the same time , the more lavish ground floor designs would make the building stand out to <unk> @-@ by and pull in the necessary business for a successful commercial building . 
 This community also saw close collaboration between architects , specialist structural engineers and building contractors emerge on the new skyscraper projects . Historically the industry had been dominated by individuals and small firms who combined the roles of architect and engineer , but this broke down in Chicago during the period , being replaced by a partnership between specialist architects who focused on the appearance of the skyscraper , and specialist engineers who focused on the structures that enabled it to be built . Chicago architectural firms grew to be large , hierarchical and with numerous specialist staff ; the famous D. H. <unk> & Company , for example , felt like a small factory to visitors , and ultimately expanded to employ 180 staff . 
 The resulting Chicago school produced large , solid @-@ looking <unk> , built with a common appearance and to a common height . The result was usually a box @-@ like <unk> , illuminated with a large light court , ideally , if space allowed , in the center . The outside of the building was commonly divided into three parts : a base , middle section and the roof line . This <unk> design was intended both to emulate classical columns , and reflect the functions of the different parts of the skyscraper . The central court could form a simple courtyard , but many companies preferred to roof over the courtyard with glass to produce an <unk> for shops and restaurants . <unk> for these shops were up to five or six times that for office space , and made an important difference to the income from a property . Chicago skyscraper windows were also a feature of the style ; these were large , fixed windows flanked by smaller sash windows on either side , which provided access to sunlight and adequate ventilation . Sometimes these <unk> from the building to form a slight bay . 
 Although the exterior of the Chicago <unk> buildings were relatively plain , the entrance ways and <unk> were fitted out in a grand style . The Unity Building , for example , was reported as including " <unk> , <unk> , Green and <unk> marbles ... an artistic screen of glass and bronze ... a marble balcony " alongside " Corinthian columns with finely carved capitals , gold @-@ leaf and silver chandeliers , and silver @-@ plated <unk> " on the <unk> . The aim was to project a sense of prosperity and solid financial credentials , which in turn would attract <unk> willing to pay high rents . For the <unk> , such surroundings were good for their own business credibility , and affirmed their own social status as professionals . 
 New York faced similar architectural challenges , but , in comparison to Chicago , skyscraper architects there worked less closely with engineers and other specialists and instead , held strong backgrounds in the <unk> Arts movement and perceived their role to be primarily artistic rather than a partnership with the mechanical arts . Their practices tended to be smaller , resembling <unk> style workshops . Structural engineers in New York took longer to build up a strong professional role there , a trend reflected in the lower engineering quality of many early <unk> in the city . The New York style emphasised stunning height and a somewhat eclectic use of architectural features from other periods , creating an energetic , flamboyant appearance . Towers were common , making best use of the relatively small plots of land in New York . Some New York <unk> <unk> the <unk> style of Chicago , but others broke their exterior down into many different layers , each with its own style . Proponents argued that this reintroduced a sense of human proportion to these tall buildings ; critics felt that the results were confused and <unk> . 
 The first <unk> were mainly occupied by male workers but this changed during the 1890s , with female employees becoming more common . The percentage of female clerical workers in Chicago , for example , increased from 11 percent in 1880 to 21 percent by 1890 , reaching 30 percent by 1900 . Various moral concerns were raised about men and women mixing in such offices , which were characterised as being masculine spaces , full of tobacco smoke and <unk> and therefore unsuitable for women . The new female workers typically worked as typists or <unk> , using the recently invented typewriter , which grew in number in US offices from 146 in 1879 to 65 @,@ 000 by 1890 . 
 <unk> provided a wide range of in @-@ house services for their <unk> , including shops , restaurants , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , professional specialists and libraries . <unk> also employed a substantial number of service staff to maintain and support them ; a building such as the Chicago Board of Trade spent 20 percent of its rental revenue on service staff , employing 41 people , including <unk> , elevator operators , engineers and an <unk> . With this collection of services and facilities , <unk> of the period were often referred to as small cities in their own right . 
 Opposition to Chicago 's <unk> began to grow during the late 1880s and early 1890s . Even before the development of the skyscraper , some criticized large buildings in Chicago for dominating churches and private houses , and this sentiment strengthened . Critics complained that the concentration of tall buildings in the center of the city was causing huge congestion , and each new skyscraper was also burning additional coal to power its facilities , together consuming a total of over one million tons each year , leaving smoke and stagnant air hanging over Chicago . Many were concerned over the risk of a major fire breaking out and spreading , uncontrolled , from building to building . 
 Chicago was not alone in having concerns over the growth of the skyscraper . In Boston , the <unk> and the Ames Buildings were built in the late 1880s , 183 feet ( 56 m ) and 190 feet ( 58 m ) tall respectively , but protests by local civic campaigners and the real estate industry resulted in the city passing a law to limit new buildings to a maximum of 123 feet ( 37 m ) , effectively banning the construction of <unk> . The cities of Philadelphia , Los Angeles and Washington D.C. similarly introduced height controls to limit skyscraper construction . 
 The decisive factor in favour of change in Chicago , however , was the economic <unk> in the early 1890s , which would end in the financial panic of 1893 . The recession , combined with the <unk> building of the previous few years , meant that Chicago suddenly had a significant surplus of office space , threatening occupancy levels and rents . Regulation was introduced by the city council to control the problem in 1892 , with support from the real estate industry who hoped to slow the construction of additional office space and shore up their diminishing profit margins . The height of new buildings was limited to 150 feet ( 46 m ) , with lower height levels on narrower streets , effectively <unk> the construction of any taller <unk> . 
 The construction of the Singer Tower was announced by the company in 1906 , who intended to produce the tallest skyscraper in the world . The company already had several lower @-@ rise buildings in New York that the tower would be incorporated into and planned to rent out the bottom half of the tower to <unk> to <unk> their use of the upper half . The skyscraper was designed by Ernest <unk> , a <unk> @-@ Arts advocate and noted critic of existing <unk> , who justified taking on the project as a way of generating support for skyscraper reform . The design was technically challenging , as such a tall , narrow tower needed special wind <unk> , and the deep bedrock on the site required particularly deep foundations . The tower was faced in dark brick and followed the <unk> @-@ Arts style used by the rest of the complex , with a <unk> lobby fitted out in Italian marble . When it opened in 1908 it had 47 stories and was 612 feet ( 187 m ) tall ; visitors paid $ 0 @.@ 50 ( $ 12 in 2010 terms ) each to use the observation area at the top of the building to see the views . 
 Meanwhile , Chicago 's skyscraper industry also <unk> during the decade before World War I. The city 's elevated train network was operating by 1910 , allowing more workers to come into the centre . In 1910 alone 1 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 square feet ( 140 @,@ 000 m2 ) of new offices were opened and by the end of the decade , Chicago had the second largest number of headquarters offices in the US . Chicago architectural firms such as Daniel H. <unk> and then Graham , Anderson , <unk> & White continued to design <unk> in the <unk> style made popular in the previous decade . Chicago had hosted the World 's Columbian Exposition in 1895 , a massive international event which had excited interest in the themes of classical architecture and well @-@ designed city landscapes . Chicago also had extensive discussions in 1909 about the potential for designing large parts of the city , the <unk> Plan of Chicago . 
 The resulting <unk> reflected these debates : the Railway Exchange , the Peoples Gas and the Illinois Continental and Commercial Bank Buildings were each substantial , quarter of block wide <unk> <unk> of common height , their facades divided into a classical <unk> design , and sporting classical columns and other features . Despite the apparent <unk> of design , individual buildings varied considerably in the detail of their designs in effort to express their particular identities , the Peoples Gas Building using texture and the Railway Exchange Building white <unk> , for example . 
 The process of building <unk> became more sophisticated , starting with the acquisition of the real estate needed for the site . <unk> working on commission would secretly acquire the individual bits of land required for a project , operating under a variety of names to avoid the price increasing once a planned build became known . The properties at the front of the site would typically be bought first , as if news broke of the skyscraper then those owning property at the back of the plot would have little choice but to sell anyway . The funding for skyscraper developments was normally lent by banks , insurance companies or raised through bonds sold through a specialised bond house , with the latter becoming increasingly popular after World War I. 
 Efforts were made to improve the processes for <unk> <unk> , largely through the work of general contractors such as Louis Horowitz and Frank <unk> , who in turn drew on recent work by efficiency specialist Frederick Taylor . Time schedules were devised for all the work to be undertaken , with cost carefully monitored and reports produced each day . The results were demonstrated on the <unk> Building construction project , where 1 @,@ 153 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 153 @,@ 000 kg ) of steel were assembled in only six days , a record for the period . <unk> <unk> techniques introduced . The use of <unk> <unk> in skyscraper foundations grew more advanced ; in the construction of the 1908 Manhattan Municipal Building they were successfully sunk 144 feet ( 44 m ) below the surface , with specially conditioned workers operating in shifts with constant medical support . 
 New technologies were also introduced within the buildings . Fast <unk> <unk> powered by electricity rather than steam @-@ driven <unk> began to be installed in <unk> for the first time , with <unk> safety air <unk> protecting the passengers in the case of failure . <unk> improved with the recommended levels in 1916 being around twice the level of electric lighting than in the 1890s . Nonetheless , <unk> still relied primarily on natural sunlight , which required installing large windows and having tall ceilings to allow the sunlight to penetrate the back of the offices ; an office deeper than 28 feet ( 8 @.@ 5 m ) was not considered a practical design . 
 One of the reasons for the increase in the numbers of <unk> during the period was the growth in demand for office workers . In part this demand was fuelled by many US firms becoming larger and more complex , and white @-@ collar sectors such as insurance and banking grew in scale . It was also driven by changing technology . The typewriter was joined in the office by the adding machine , the telephone and filing <unk> , all adding to the demand for office space and requiring increasingly specialised workers . 
 <unk> and rental income were essential to the financial success of any skyscraper , as even the largest <unk> and those founded by prominent companies rented out much of their office space . <unk> could charge significantly more for office space close to the main windows , making it most efficient to build <unk> with as much premium office space as possible , even if this cost slightly more to construct in the first instance . As a result , a standard pattern for office units in both New York and Chicago emerged , with either a single rectangular office adjoining an exterior wall , or a " T " shaped design , with a reception room giving way to two <unk> offices , separated by glass <unk> . <unk> usually took on large numbers of relatively small companies as their <unk> . A skyscraper such as the <unk> Tower had around 600 different <unk> in 1913 , for example , while a typical tenant might rent four or five office units in a skyscraper . 
 <unk> , particularly those in New York , attracted considerable comment , much of it negative . On his return to New York , the writer Henry James condemned the buildings in The American Scene as simply " giants of the mere market " , " mercenary monsters " doomed to be torn down in turn as other , even larger , buildings took their place . In Chicago the combination of the environmental pollution and <unk> meant that , as Charles Warner complained , " one can scarcely see across the streets on a <unk> day , and the huge buildings <unk> up in the black sky in <unk> <unk> " . 
 Amongst the architectural community , the Exposition in Chicago inspired many in America to champion designing cities that had a unified design , in which each building had unique features but <unk> complemented its neighbours , typically by being built to a common height : " horizontal visual unity " . In the aftermath of the Exposition , many of these advocates joined with the <unk> @-@ Arts movement to form the City Beautiful movement , proposing low @-@ rise cities with wide boulevards , built in a classical style . These critics condemned New York 's <unk> , Montgomery <unk> describing how they had produced a " horribly jagged <unk> " of a city skyline and complaining that no modern skyscraper had turned out to be an architectural success . Charles Lamb argued that the skyscraper <unk> on the rights of the rest of the city by destroying the collective appearance of an urban area . Some architects , such as Charles <unk> and Stanford White refused to work on such projects altogether . 
 <unk> were made in New York for legislation to prevent the growth of <unk> , citing their effect on the city <unk> , but these attempts faced legal obstacles . The US constitution did not give local authorities authority to prevent the buildings on the grounds of aesthetics alone , and any such law in New York was considered likely to face judicial challenge . 
 Others argued that legal reform of skyscraper construction was needed for public health and safety reasons , an area in which US law was normally more supportive of state intervention . The risk of fire was one concern ; while <unk> might be relatively <unk> , their height made conventional fire @-@ fighting difficult . The architect Charles <unk> considered a large scale , devastating high @-@ rise fire to be inevitable if regulation was not forthcoming . The Baltimore fire of 1904 was widely cited as an example of this risk and , although Baltimore had almost no real <unk> , city lawyers argued that the taller buildings had caused the flames to spread through the city during the <unk> . Baltimore subsequently passed a law in 1904 , banning buildings higher than 70 feet ( 21 m ) . Other campaigners argued that <unk> were <unk> access to light and air , noting that when tall buildings rose straight up from the <unk> , they cast long shadows across the street , preventing healthy sunlight from ever reaching smaller buildings below . 
 Early attempts by Ernest <unk> to limit the height of New York 's <unk> in 1896 failed ; further unsuccessful attempts followed between 1906 and 1908 , and legislation was turned down again in 1909 , partially due to pressure from the real estate industry . After 1913 , however , the property market in New York entered a recession and vacancy levels in buildings began to rise . The campaign for change was helped by the construction of the <unk> Building in 1915 at the estimated cost of $ 29 million ( $ 10 @.@ 9 billion in 2010 terms ) , which rapidly became infamous as its vast height and bulk blocked views and cast neighbours into permanent shade . The real estate industry finally ceased its objections to new legislation and the 1916 <unk> Resolution was passed . 
 The details of the legislation itself was largely the work of architect George Ford . Ford had sympathies with the City Beautiful movement , disliked the <unk> form of many New York <unk> and had concerns over urban public health , but he also found tall buildings exciting and believed that horizontal visual unity produced boring architecture . As a consequence of Ford 's influence , New York 's laws were relatively complex and divided up the city into different zones ; in each zone , a particular <unk> envelope applied , controlling the height to which buildings could be built . Typically a building could only rise up from the <unk> vertically by around 100 feet ( 30 m ) , after which the building had to be set back at a set angle to allow sunlight to reach the street below . On a quarter of the site , however , the owner could build as high as they wished , without any further restrictions . 
 A real estate boom occurred in the US after the end of the First World War , with a particular surge in the construction of new <unk> between 1925 and 1931 . In New York , a quarter of the financial district was rebuilt between 1928 and 1931 , with 17 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 square feet ( 1 @,@ 600 @,@ 000 m2 ) of new office @-@ space added between 1925 and 1929 alone . Chicago saw pressure grow on its existing office @-@ space during the war ; limited wartime construction created supply shortages and rent levels rose in response by around 100 percent between 1919 and 1924 . This level of potential profits encouraged an explosion of new building projects in the city . The boom inflated prices in the real estate market , leading to speculative financing and building projects , including the introduction of 100 percent <unk> for new builds . An early edition of the Fortune magazine commented <unk> that " all a man needs to own a skyscraper is the money and the land . And he may be able to get along without the money . " 
 <unk> continued to grow in height throughout the 1920s . In part this was the result of improvements in technology : steel @-@ frame structures had become increasingly efficient , while improvements in elevator design made taller buildings easier to ascend . Commercial factors were at work too , as growing commercial demand pushed up rents , enabling taller projects , while the higher offices attracted more sunlight , permitting the charging of premium rents . The tallest buildings could also acquire publicity for their owners , in turn making it easier to find and keep the best <unk> . Furthermore , the higher the cost of the underlying real estate , the taller a building needed to be to generate a suitable return on the investment , and the minimum sensible commercial height for a skyscraper project grew to between 40 and 45 stories . 70 story <unk> became relatively common , although an influential 1930 study demonstrated that the best rate of return on a skyscraper was to build it 63 stories high , returning an annual profit of 10 @.@ 25 percent . 
 <unk> continued to spread both across the US and internationally . New York and Chicago remained the center of skyscraper development but most major centres in the US had built <unk> by 1929 , frequently as a result of competition between rival cities for status and investment . Cincinnati built the Cincinnati Towers in 1914 , followed by the <unk> Tower Complex in 1930 . In Detroit , the General Motors Building opened in 1920 and the Fisher Building in 1928 . Cleveland acquired the Union Trust Building in 1923 and the Terminal Tower in 1929 ; the latter , built by the Van <unk> brothers , was , for a short period , the second tallest building in the world . Seattle had built Smith Tower as early as 1914 and the Los Angeles local government granted itself an exemption from city planning restrictions , in order to build the Los Angeles City Hall in 1928 . In 1928 , the Industrial Trust Tower was built in Providence . 
 <unk> were also built in other developed countries , although reaching nowhere near the level of construction seen in the US . This was partially due to a lack of funding but also because of local architectural preferences . European cities including London and Paris had laws to ban tall buildings , but elsewhere <unk> began to appear including Toronto 's Imperial Bank of Commerce Building , Antwerp 's <unk> or Buenos Aires ' <unk> Building . Many other European <unk> were proposed in a <unk> of excited planning , although few <unk> . Soviet Russia began the construction of the 1 @,@ 365 @-@ foot ( <unk> m ) Palace of the Soviets in the late 1930s , in the Socialist <unk> style , which would have become the tallest building in the world , but war intervened and the skyscraper was never completed . In the post @-@ war years , this style would result in the monumental Seven Sisters of Moscow building . 
 The technology used in constructing <unk> continued to develop . Time was increasingly a factor in the projects , and architects and their specialist teams developed faster ways to design and construct the buildings to minimise the interest payments during the build and hasten the arrival of rental income . By 1930 <unk> were being erected in just 12 months by teams of workers totalling 5 @,@ 000 men , with four floors being assembled in a typical week . Building skyscraper towers involved some <unk> of engineering techniques , as effectively two different buildings were being designed – the base and the tower – which needed to be efficiently linked using <unk> and other service facilities . Most new offices settled around a standard size , 9 feet ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) wide by 20 to 30 ft ( 6 @.@ 1 to 9 @.@ 1 m ) deep , depending on the height of the ceiling , with multiple small windows considered better than a few larger ones . The output of electric lighting continued to improve , although this began to give off excessive heat within the offices . Air conditioning was first installed in a few <unk> during the 1930s . 
 During the 1920s and 1930s many <unk> were designed in an Art Deco style . This architectural approach typically combined what Carol Willis terms an " aesthetic of simple , <unk> mass " with the use of rich colour and ornamentation on the surfaces of the buildings . The aim was to call attention to the increasingly complex three @-@ dimensional shape of the skyscraper , in contrast to earlier styles which could be critiqued , as historian Larry Ford suggests , as being merely " short buildings made taller with additional stories " . Windows were de @-@ emphasised in favour of creating a strong sense of shape and mass , the surrounding walls treated as textured fabric , dressing the building underneath . <unk> of this period typically lost their ornamental horizontal divisions , being broken up by physical changes in their shape as one looked up the building , the whole forming a striking <unk> . 
 In New York , the 1916 act to allow light and air to reach the streets encouraged a stepped or <unk> approach to skyscraper design ; this " set @-@ back " style often made unrestricted use of the 25 percent of the site allowed by law to complete with a very tall tower . This encouraged a diversity of buildings , while maintaining an element of harmony and consistency of style . The Paramount Building and 120 Wall Street , for example , were constructed in the set @-@ back style without towers , partially because the limited size of the sites would have made the towers relatively narrow and – when packed with the necessary <unk> and service facilities – economically <unk> . Many other <unk> built on larger or more expensive plots opted for the tallest towers possible , including the $ 24 million ( $ 3 @.@ 8 billion in 2010 terms ) Bank of Manhattan Trust Building and the City Bank @-@ <unk> Trust Company Building . New York continued its lead in tall <unk> throughout the period ; in 1920 it had ten times the number of tall buildings than its nearest rival Chicago . 
 Chicago altered its laws in the 1920s to allow towers to be built as part of its <unk> . In 1920 the maximum building height in Chicago was increased to 260 feet ( 79 m ) , and unoccupied structures on a building , such as ornamental towers , were allowed to extend up to 400 feet ( 120 m ) high . Additional changes came in 1923 , with taller , occupied towers being permitted for the first time , but subject to controls on overall volumes . The main building of a skyscraper could be up to 264 feet ( 80 m ) tall , and a tower could be built on up to 25 percent of the plot , but this tower could not have a volume of more than a sixth of the main block . In practice , this meant that a tower could not be built more than around 20 stories tall in a typical Chicago skyscraper development . 
 Initially , Chicago still preferred <unk> @-@ styled buildings with large light courts in the centre , not least because they remained the most profitable designs . The Wrigley Building , built under the 1920 law , demonstrated the effect of two ornamental towers on top of a skyscraper . Under the revised law , the <unk> Building and the Pittsfield Building took the <unk> design and added somewhat stunted towers on top in the early 1920s , producing profitable buildings . 
 One of the period 's most famous buildings , the Tribune Tower , emerged from a competition held by the Tribune Company in 1922 to celebrate its 75th anniversary . The newspaper was one of the largest in the world and used the competition , in which members of the public were invited to influence the design of the skyscraper , to build a loyal following amongst its readership and generate free publicity . The final design was determined by a competition panel largely made up of the company 's <unk> , who chose John <unk> and Raymond Hood 's tower design . The resulting tower was a conservative , Gothic design and controversy about the decision broke out almost immediately : Louis Sullivan and many others criticized <unk> and Hood 's design as being derivative of the <unk> Tower . Regardless of its critics , the Tribune received as many as 20 @,@ 000 visitors to its observation gallery when it opened in 1925 . The <unk> second @-@ place entry in the competition , a more simplified stepped @-@ back design by <unk> <unk> , also proved highly influential . 
 The popularity of the older style then began to <unk> in favor of a greater emphasis on towers . One common way of building these within Chicago 's laws was to build a square main block with a central service core , and then simply place a tower on the top ; the more massive the main block , the taller the tower could be . The Trustees System Service Building and the <unk> State National Bank Building form good examples of this approach . Alternatively , the front of the main block could be <unk> , as at the Chicago Civic Opera Building or the <unk> @-@ <unk> Building , <unk> volume but producing the visual effect of two high wings flanking a very tall tower . The distinctive New York " setback " style was not adopted in Chicago , the only example of the style being the <unk> Building on North Michigan Avenue . 
 The boom in skyscraper construction began to <unk> following the Wall Street Crash of 1929 , with fast economic growth giving way to the slump years of the Great Depression : building of all sorts slowed considerably . The real estate market that lay behind new skyscraper builds collapsed and the value of many properties dropped dramatically : the American Insurance Union tower cost $ 8 million ( $ 1 @.@ 2 billion in 2010 terms ) to build in 1927 , but was valued at only $ 3 @.@ 5 million ( $ 900 million ) by 1933 ; the Bank of Manhattan Trust Building <unk> on its debts in 1935 and was put on sale for just $ 1 @.@ 2 million ( $ 240 m ) . The major bond house of S. W. <unk> , behind many successful developments , <unk> on the $ <unk> million ( $ 47 billion ) in bonds held by 60 @,@ 000 investors ; the Van <unk> developer brothers went bankrupt . <unk> rates began to increase as the recession bit , increasing from only one percent in central New York in early 1920 to 17 percent in 1931 and 25 percent by 1934 . 
 In the face of the recession , some <unk> projects were canceled or scaled back . Plans by the Metropolitan Life company to build a 100 @-@ story skyscraper alongside their existing tower had been put forward in 1929 , but were <unk> in the face of the recession and public criticism of such expenditure in the economic climate . Instead the first phase of the project , known as the North Building ended up only 32 stories high in 1932 and the building , even at this height , was only fully completed in 1950 . In many other cases , projects which had already been commissioned continued through to completion . This resulted in 26 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 square feet ( 2 @,@ 400 @,@ 000 m2 ) of new office space being added to New York between 1931 – 34 even after the start of the recession , adding to the problem of <unk> . Some of these buildings , however , became iconic structures , pushing the limits of skyscraper height sharply upwards . 
 The Chrysler Building was completed in 1930 , just after the Depression began to affect the industry . <unk> William Van <unk> competed with the designers of the Bank of Manhattan Trust Building to produce the tallest building in the world , and famously erected the Chrysler spire in a last @-@ minute , secret move in order to acquire the title for his own 69 story , 1 @,@ <unk> @-@ foot ( 319 m ) tall building . The exterior was built of white and grey brick , but metal was used extensively to ornament it further , including <unk> , nickel @-@ chrome eagles ' heads , and a winged helmet of Mercury . The entrance used black granite to contrast with the nickel @-@ chrome windows , and the <unk> gave way to red marble and a mural ceiling . The design of each part of the building was <unk> and distinct , with even each elevator different in design . A Chrysler <unk> was placed on the first floor of the building , and an observation deck and the exclusive " Cloud Club " on the upper levels . 
 The Empire State Building originated from a 1928 project to <unk> the Waldorf @-@ Astoria Hotel into a 50 @-@ story mixed @-@ use development ; the purchase of the site for $ 14 million ( $ 2 @.@ 1 billion ) set a record in New York for the year . John <unk> and Pierre du <unk> entered into the project as financial <unk> , and concluded that the project would be more profitable if the site was used to build an extremely tall 80 @-@ story skyscraper instead . Although revised financial estimates suggested that the height should be cut back , the <unk> of having the world 's tallest building was considerable and instead an additional five stories were added to ensure the building , at 1 @,@ 050 feet ( 320 m ) , would be just taller than the Chrysler . An observation deck was built to attract tourists , which proved to be a valuable source of revenue . The limestone , granite , and aluminium skyscraper was specially designed to be easily erected , with standardized <unk> and structural fittings , and was completed in only 18 months , opening in 1931 . Due to the recession , however , it was only 25 percent occupied throughout the 1930s and ran at a loss ; critics dubbed it the " Empty State Building " . 
 The Rockefeller Center had originally been intended by John D. Rockefeller , Jr. to be a new location for the Metropolitan Opera House but the Stock Market Crash brought an end to the scheme . Rockefeller decided to develop a large office center instead , taking advantage of the low construction costs during the recession . At the center of the development was the RCA Building , heavily influenced by architect Raymond Hood . The long , slab @-@ like RCA had two distinct axes – from one side , it appeared to be a narrow tower , from the other it rose like a sheer wall . Not only was the structure highly distinctive , but it was also economically very effective . The design <unk> the available light to the offices and eliminated any darker internal rooms , as the core of the building was entirely taken up with <unk> and other engineering services . Due to the recession , however , it took until 1940 before all of the building had been filled by <unk> . 
 In Chicago , the final pre @-@ war skyscraper was built in 1934 . The Field Building was commissioned during the final boom years of the inter @-@ war economy , and the Home Insurance Building – the first skyscraper , built in 1884 – was demolished to make way for the " wing and tower " <unk> development . 
 Hollywood used <unk> extensively in popular films . The <unk> of New York in 1906 became the first of many , and in the 1920s Harold Lloyd produced his five " skyscraper films " , most prominently Safety Last ! , in which the hero <unk> from a clock on the side of a Los Angeles building . In these early silent movies , <unk> were closely associated with masculine identity ; Lloyd 's climbing of <unk> closely associated with his characters ' transformation from young men into mature adults , and the winning of the heroine . The 1933 film King Kong included another iconic use of the early skyscraper in its final scenes , as the giant <unk> scaled the Empire State Building shortly before his death ; the scene can be interpreted as contrasting natural instinct with the insensitive rationality of the modern building and wider New York . 
 <unk> development paused during the years of the Second World War . Once development began again in the 1950s and 1960s , the skyscraper entered a different phase of development , usually called the international or modern period . Some experimental designs in this style had been built in the US using European architectural concepts in the early 1930s , most notably the Philadelphia <unk> Fund Society and <unk> @-@ Hill Buildings . Post @-@ war , their modernist themes were used in a new generation of <unk> . These stood alone on individual plots in the fashion of the Rockefeller Centre 's RCA building , rather than as part of a row of buildings , forming huge slabs and towers featuring huge glass façades , breaking with earlier skyscraper traditions . Inside , new technologies such as fluorescent lighting and widespread air @-@ conditioning meant that many older architectural features such as light courts and <unk> windows were unnecessary . 
 The trend had substantial implications for many early <unk> . Some were redesigned to fit new tastes . Much of the ornate detail was removed from the Metropolitan Life Tower in the 1960s , for example , to fit contemporary , <unk> <unk> . Many older <unk> could not be adapted , however , as they lacked the physical depth to build larger modern offices or the space for new service facilities . Some were demolished to make way for new , larger structures . Amongst these was the Singer Tower , demolished in 1968 and replaced by the international style United States Steel Building . In the 21st century , buildings such as 90 West Street have been renovated as <unk> housing , partially because of their extensive windows and access to sunlight . 
 The Duke of Edinburgh @-@ class cruiser was a class of two armoured cruisers built for the Royal Navy in the first decade of the 20th century . They were the first British armoured cruisers designed to work with the <unk> rather than protect merchant shipping . After commissioning , they were assigned to the Atlantic , Channel and Home Fleets until 1913 when they were transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet . After the start of World War I in August 1914 , the sister ships participated in the pursuit of the German battlecruiser SMS Goeben and light cruiser SMS Breslau . After the German ships reached their refuge in Ottoman Turkey , the ships were ordered to the Red Sea for convoy escort duties . They captured three German merchant ships before they returned to home at the end of the year . 
 The sisters participated in the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 where Black Prince was sunk with all hands . Duke of Edinburgh spent the next year on blockade duties in the North Sea before she was transferred to the Atlantic Ocean on convoy escort duties for the rest of the war . She was sold for scrap in 1920 . 
 After the preceding Devonshire class , the Royal Navy <unk> how it planned to use its armoured cruisers . It decided that they were going to form a fast wing of the <unk> which meant that they required heavier armour and armament to fight their counterparts in opposing fleets and thus larger and more expensive . Two armoured cruisers were planned for the 1902 – 1903 Naval Programme and the newly appointed Director of Naval Construction , Philip Watts designed what naval historian Oscar <unk> called : " cruiser editions of the King Edward VII @-@ class battleships " . In these , his first design , he <unk> the worst feature of the designs by his predecessor , Sir William White , by placing the secondary armament of six @-@ inch ( 150 mm ) guns in <unk> a deck below the main armament which meant that the guns were inoperable in anything more than a dead calm sea . A solution for this problem was offered after construction began when Watts learned that the ships would be lighter than expected and that weight would be available to replace the six @-@ inch guns with 7 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 190 mm ) guns raised to the same deck as the main armament . The change would cost a total of £ 398 @,@ 000 for the two ships , far too expensive for the Board of Admiralty , so it was rejected on 30 March 1904 . 
 The Duke of Edinburgh @-@ class ships were designed to displace 13 @,@ 550 long tons ( 13 @,@ 770 t ) , but they proved to be significantly lighter as built , <unk> 12 @,@ 590 long tons ( 12 @,@ 790 t ) at normal load and 13 @,@ 965 long tons ( 14 @,@ 189 t ) fully loaded . The ships had an overall length of 505 feet 6 inches ( 154 @.@ 1 m ) and a length between <unk> of 480 ft ( 146 @.@ 3 m ) . They had a beam of 73 feet 6 inches ( 22 @.@ 4 m ) and a deep draught of 26 feet 6 inches ( 8 @.@ 1 m ) forward and 27 feet 6 inches ( 8 @.@ 4 m ) aft . The class was over 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) longer overall than the <unk> and displaced over 2 @,@ 500 long tons ( 2 @,@ 540 t ) more . 
 The ships ' complement was <unk> officers and enlisted men . They rolled quickly with a <unk> height of 4 @.@ 2 feet ( 1 @.@ 3 m ) at deep load and their six @-@ inch guns were as wet as predicted . 
 The cruisers were powered by two 4 @-@ cylinder triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving one shaft , which produced a total of 23 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 17 @,@ 150 kW ) and gave a maximum speed of 23 knots ( 43 km / h ; 26 mph ) . The engines were powered by 20 Babcock & Wilcox water @-@ tube boilers and six cylindrical boilers . The ships carried a maximum of 2 @,@ 150 long tons ( 2 @,@ 180 t ) of coal and an additional 600 long tons ( 610 t ) of fuel oil that was <unk> on the coal to increase its burn rate . At full capacity , they could steam for 8 @,@ 130 nautical miles ( 15 @,@ 060 km ; 9 @,@ 360 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 The Duke of Edinburgh 's main armament consisted of six 45 @-@ calibre BL 9 @.@ 2 @-@ inch Mk X guns in single @-@ gun turrets , a much more powerful gun than used in the <unk> . The guns were distributed in two <unk> turrets , one each fore and one aft of the superstructure , and four wing turrets disposed in the corners about the funnels . The <unk> turrets could traverse a total of 285 ° while the wing turrets were limited to about 120 ° on the broadside due to muzzle blast . The gun had an elevation range of − 5 ° to + 15 ° . The 9 @.@ 2 @-@ inch ( 230 mm ) shell weighed 380 pounds ( 172 @.@ 4 kg ) and was fired at a maximum muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ <unk> ft / s ( <unk> m / s ) . This gave it a range of 15 @,@ 500 yards ( 14 @,@ 200 m ) at maximum elevation . The gun 's rate of fire was about three rounds per minute and the ships carried 100 rounds for each gun . 
 Their secondary armament of ten 50 @-@ calibre BL 6 @-@ inch Mk XI guns was arranged in single <unk> . They were mounted amidships on the main deck and were only usable in calm weather . The guns could only traverse about 120 ° on the broadside . They initially had a maximum elevation of + 13 ° , but this was later increased to + 20 ° . This gave them a range of 14 @,@ 310 yards ( 13 @,@ 090 m ) at an elevation of + 15 ° with their 100 @-@ pound ( 45 @.@ 4 kg ) shell . Each gun was provided with 150 rounds . 
 Twenty Vickers quick @-@ firing ( QF ) 3 @-@ pounder guns were fitted for defence against torpedo boats , six on turret roofs and fourteen in the superstructure , all on <unk> mounts . These guns were too small to be useful against the torpedo boats before they got within torpedo range . They fired a 47 @-@ millimetre ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) shell that weighed 3 @.@ 3 pounds ( 1 @.@ 5 kg ) and was fired at a maximum muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ <unk> ft / s ( 789 m / s ) . This gave it a range of 7 @,@ 550 yards ( 6 @,@ 900 m ) at an elevation of + 20 ° . 250 rounds were carried for each gun . 
 The ships also mounted three submerged 18 @-@ inch torpedo tubes . They carried a total of eighteen torpedoes in addition to the six 14 @-@ inch ( <unk> mm ) torpedoes that could be used by the two 45 @-@ foot ( 13 @.@ 7 m ) steam <unk> . 
 The Duke of Edinburgh @-@ class ships had a 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) waterline armour belt of <unk> cemented armour that covered 260 feet ( 79 @.@ 2 m ) of the hull amidships . It covered the side of the ship up to the upper deck , a height of 14 feet 6 inches ( 4 @.@ 42 m ) above the waterline and reached 4 feet 10 inches ( 1 @.@ 47 m ) below it . Between the central citadel and the bow , the belt armour was 4 inches ( 102 mm ) thick and it extended to the stern with a thickness of 3 inches ( 76 mm ) . <unk> bulkheads six inches thick protected the citadel from <unk> fire . 
 The faces of the gun turrets were 7 @.@ 5 inches thick with 5 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 140 mm ) sides and a 2 @-@ inch ( 51 mm ) roof . The barbettes were protected by six inches of armour as were the ammunition hoists , although the armour for those <unk> to three inches between the armour belt . Two @-@ inch armour screens separated each of the six @-@ inch guns . The thickness of the lower deck was only <unk> inches ( 19 mm ) except for a patch of 1 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 38 mm ) armour over the steering gear and another 2 inches ( 51 mm ) thick over the engine cylinders . The sides of the conning tower were 10 inches ( 254 mm ) thick . 
 The funnels proved to be too short in service and they were raised about 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) four years after completion to keep the superstructure free of smoke in a following wind . In March 1916 , both ships had all their six @-@ inch guns removed , the <unk> plated over , and six of the guns were <unk> on the upper deck . In May 1917 , two more were added to Duke of Edinburgh on the forecastle . The ship 's foremast was converted to a tripod mast to support the weight of the fire @-@ control director probably added in 1917 . 
 Duke of Edinburgh and Black Prince served in the Channel , Atlantic and Home Fleets before World War I. They were stationed in the Mediterranean when World War I began and participated in the pursuit of the Goeben and Breslau as part of the 1st Cruiser Squadron , but was ordered not to engage . After the German ships reached Ottoman waters , the ships were sent to the Red Sea in mid @-@ August to protect troop convoys arriving from India . While on escort duty they captured three German <unk> . 
 The two sisters rejoined the 1st Cruiser Squadron in December 1914 , which had transferred to the Grand Fleet and participated in the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 . Black Prince became separated from the fleet when darkness fell and was sunk with all hands by German battleships later that night . Duke of Edinburgh was not damaged during the battle and was the only ship of her squadron to survive . After Jutland Duke of Edinburgh was ordered to reinforce the patrols north of the Shetland Islands against German blockade runners and commerce raiders . She was eventually transferred to the Atlantic in August 1917 for convoy escort duties . The ship was sold for scrap in 1920 . 
 John Baldwin ( October 13 , <unk> – December 28 , 1884 ) was an American <unk> , and the founder of Baldwin Institute ( later Baldwin University ) in <unk> , Ohio , which would eventually merge into Baldwin – Wallace College . He was also the founder of Baker University and Baldwin City , Kansas , and contributed money to start schools in Bangalore , India that are today called Baldwin Boys High School , Baldwin Girls High School and Baldwin Co @-@ Education <unk> High School . 
 Born in Connecticut , Baldwin originally was a teacher in Maryland and Connecticut before moving to Ohio in the late 1820s . He became part of the <unk> movement , and situated himself in <unk> , Ohio . He opened up Baldwin Institute in 1846 upon seeing the dissolution of the Norwalk <unk> . Nine years later , the Institute became Baldwin University . He moved to Kansas around 1857 , laying the foundation for Baldwin City , Kansas , as well as Baker University . In his later life , he purchased a Louisiana plantation , and made contributions to education in India late in his life . 
 John Baldwin was born in <unk> , Connecticut on 13 October <unk> to Joseph Baldwin and <unk> <unk> . His mother was a well @-@ educated woman , as well as intensely religious . She attempted to become a student at Yale University , but was not allowed because she was a woman . Due to this , John resolved to make no distinction between races or sexes should he ever found a school . His father enlisted in the Continental Army during the American Revolution as a private and left as a captain . When John turned eighteen , he joined the Methodist Church . As a student at a private school , he paid his way by <unk> <unk> , ringing the bell , and building fires . Afterwards , he became a teacher in <unk> , New York , Maryland , and <unk> , Connecticut . As a teacher in Maryland , his stance on slavery , as well as black people as a whole , was revealed . A <unk> boy was sent to his school daily as a servant for his master 's son . Baldwin began to teach them in common . When the student 's father found out about this , he demanded Baldwin not teach him any more , to which he replied , " I do not charge anything for teaching him " and continued to teach him . 
 In 1843 , Baldwin noticed that the Norwalk <unk> , located in Norwalk , Ohio , was dissolving due to lack of funds . He approached Thomas Thompson , who was the elder of the Norwalk District ( which included Cleveland and <unk> ) , and asked him to visit <unk> . At Baldwin 's Old Red House , an agreement was made where Baldwin would create a campus on his farm similar to the Norwalk <unk> . Baldwin Institute officially opened on April 9 , 1846 . It was meant to open in 1845 , but the process was delayed until the completion of a building on Baldwin 's farm , which was erected by Baldwin himself , made of stone <unk> on his farm and brick made of clay . The institute was open to people of all races , male or female , as Baldwin wanted . It became Baldwin University and was given a charter in 1855 . The university later became Baldwin – Wallace College in 1913 . 
 At age fifty @-@ eight , Baldwin desired to satisfy his nature of being a pioneer again by moving to Kansas , which was at that time a territory . He arrived as the brunt of the fighting in the territory was ending . Upon his arrival , he founded Baldwin City and built the first college building in the territory , which became the foundation for Baker University . He was in Kansas only for a short time when tragedy struck . On August 30 , 1858 , John 's son Milton died unexpectedly after having been sick for only three days . Within a couple years , he laid out a town , built a <unk> mill and a saw mill , and he turned over the town and college to the Methodist Conference and returned to <unk> , although he continued to finance it . 
 In 1867 , Baldwin purchased the Darby plantation in Louisiana , a plantation of about 1 @,@ 700 acres ( 6 @.@ 9 km2 ) . At the age of eighty , Baldwin learned of the situation in India ; there were large numbers of Europeans in India who could not get a proper education . The Baldwin High School for Boys and the Baldwin High School for Girls were then built in 1880 . John Baldwin died at his home in Baldwin , Louisiana on Sunday , December 28 , 1884 , at 10 <unk> Baldwin 's family even left their legacy on the campus long after Baldwin 's death . A person of historical significance to the university 's history is <unk> Gould Baldwin . <unk> Gould Baldwin graduated in 1886 and was the granddaughter of John Baldwin . <unk> started the school 's first library by collecting and <unk> books . Beyond this , <unk> suggested the traditional colors of brown and gold for the school colors . These were also the school colors for Baldwin University , which still stand today . <unk> died from consumption at age 26 ( b . November 28 , 1865 ; d . March 3 , 1892 ) . The Baldwin family donated funds for a library that was dedicated in her memory in June 1894 . The <unk> Gould Baldwin Library was eventually made part of the <unk> Center in the 1900s . 
 John Baldwin was a person whose views seemed to run counter to the conventional customs of the time . Despite his accomplishments , he never wrote a book , held public office , or even kept books . Although he was not an abolitionist by definition , he had no problem teaching blacks and whites as equals , as evident by his opening Baldwin Institute without regard to race or gender . His parents taught him to fear God , and he consequently devoted himself to living <unk> and <unk> , to being kind to the poor , and to joining the Methodist Church . 
 Stephen John Nash , <unk> , <unk> ( born February 7 , 1974 ) , is a Canadian retired professional basketball player who played in the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) . He was an eight @-@ time NBA All @-@ Star and a seven @-@ time All @-@ NBA selection . Twice , Nash was named the NBA Most Valuable Player while playing for the Phoenix Suns . He currently serves as general manager of the Canadian national team and as a player development consultant for the Golden State Warriors . 
 After a successful high school basketball career in British Columbia , Nash earned a scholarship to Santa <unk> University in California . In his four seasons with the Broncos , the team made three NCAA Tournament appearances , and he was twice named the West Coast Conference ( <unk> ) Player of the Year . Nash graduated from Santa <unk> as the team 's all @-@ time leader in assists and was taken as the 15th pick in the 1996 NBA draft by the Phoenix Suns . He made minimal impact and was traded to the Dallas <unk> in 1998 . By his third season with the <unk> , he was voted to his first NBA All @-@ Star Game and had earned his first All @-@ NBA selection . Together with Dirk <unk> and Michael Finley , Nash led the <unk> to the Western Conference Finals the following season . He became a free agent after the 2003 – 04 season and returned to the Phoenix Suns . 
 In the 2004 – 05 season , Nash led the Suns to the Western Conference Finals and was named the league 's MVP . He was named MVP again in the 2005 – 06 season and was runner @-@ up for a third consecutive MVP to <unk> in 2006 – 07 . Named by ESPN in 2006 as the ninth greatest point guard of all time , Nash led the league in assists and free @-@ throw percentage at various points in his career . He is also ranked as one of the top players in NBA league history in three @-@ point shooting , free @-@ throw shooting , total assists , and assists per game . 
 Nash has been honoured for his contributions to various philanthropic causes . In 2006 , he was named by Time as one of the 100 most influential people in the world . He was appointed to the Order of Canada in 2007 and invested to the order in 2016 , and was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Laws by the University of Victoria in 2008 . 
 Nash has been a co @-@ owner of the Vancouver <unk> FC of Major League Soccer ( <unk> ) since the team entered the league in 2011 . In 2012 , he was named general manager of the Canadian men 's national basketball team , for whom he played from 1991 to 2003 . 
 Nash was born in Johannesburg , South Africa , to a Welsh mother , Jean , and English father , John , on 7 February 1974 . His family moved to Regina , Saskatchewan when he was 18 months old , before settling in Victoria , British Columbia . He therefore holds British as well as Canadian citizenship . Before the family settled in Canada , his father played professional soccer in various parts of the world . Nash often played soccer and ice hockey with his younger brother Martin , and did not start playing basketball until he was 12 or 13 years old . In grade eight , however , he told his mother that one day he would play in the NBA and would become a star . He was neighbour to future NHL stars Russ and Geoff <unk> , who used to <unk> him and played soccer coached by Nash 's father . 
 Nash originally attended Mount Douglas Secondary School in <unk> , British Columbia , but after his grades began to drop , his parents decided to enroll him at St. Michaels University School , a private boarding school in Victoria . There , he starred in basketball , soccer , and rugby union . While playing basketball during his senior season , Nash averaged 21 @.@ 3 points , 11 @.@ 2 assists , and 9 @.@ 1 rebounds per game . In the 1991 – 92 season , he led his team in his final year to the British Columbia AAA provincial championship title , and was named the province 's Player of the Year . 
 Although Nash 's high school coach , Ian Hyde @-@ Lay , sent letters of inquiry and highlight reels on Nash 's behalf to over 30 American universities , Nash was not recruited by any university , until Santa <unk> coach Dick <unk> requested video footage of the young guard . After watching Nash in person , <unk> said he " was nervous as hell just hoping that no one else would see him . It didn 't take a Nobel Prize winner to figure out this guy 's pretty good . It was just a case of hoping that none of the big names came around . " However , <unk> also told Nash that he was " the worst defensive player " he had ever seen . 
 Nash was awarded a scholarship by Santa <unk> for the 1992 – 93 season . At that time , it had been five years since the Broncos appeared in the NCAA tournament . That changed when Nash led the Broncos to a <unk> Tournament title and an upset win over the No. 2 <unk> Arizona in the first round of the NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament . In that game , Nash scored six straight free throws in the last 30 seconds of the contest . Although Santa <unk> was defeated by Temple in the next round , the 1992 – 93 campaign was considered a successful one . However , the Broncos failed to sustain the momentum the following season , and only managed a 5 – 7 record in the conference . The team rebounded in the 1994 – 95 season , with Nash being named Conference Player of the Year and the Broncos topping the <unk> . Featuring the league leader for scoring and assists in Nash , the Broncos returned to the NCAA tournament , but they were defeated by Mississippi State . After the season , Nash contemplated turning professional , and decided against it when he learned that he would probably not be considered as a first @-@ round pick in the 1995 NBA Draft . 
 After graduating with a degree in sociology , Nash was selected 15th overall by the Phoenix Suns in the first round of the 1996 NBA draft . Upon hearing the draft announcement , Suns fans <unk> in disapproval of the relatively unknown player . This was because despite his impressive college accomplishments , Nash had not played in one of the major college conferences . A major influence in Phoenix 's choice was assistant coach Donnie Nelson , who met Nash back in high school as he was coached by Nelson 's friend Ken Shields , and would eventually befriend the player as he played in Santa <unk> . During his first two seasons in the NBA , Nash played a supporting role behind NBA star point guards Kevin Johnson , Sam <unk> , and later , Jason <unk> . Both Johnson and <unk> had NBA Finals experience , while <unk> was the second overall pick in the 1994 NBA Draft and already an All @-@ Star when he arrived at Phoenix . 
 In his rookie season , Nash only managed 10 @.@ 5 minutes a game , but in his second season , his playing time increased significantly and he was even ranked 13th in the league for three @-@ point field @-@ goal percentage . Nevertheless , the Canadian 's tenure with the Suns did not last . Nelson had just taken a job as assistant general manager of the Dallas <unk> under his father , Don Nelson , and convinced him to acquire the under @-@ utilised Nash . Following the 1998 NBA Draft , Nash was traded from the Suns to the <unk> in exchange for Martin <unk> , <unk> Wells , the draft rights to Pat <unk> and a first @-@ round draft pick ( who later turned out to be future Phoenix team @-@ mate Shawn Marion ) . 
 It was in Dallas that Nash established himself as a formidable point guard , beginning a decade as one of the game 's top players . During his first year as a Maverick ( the <unk> @-@ shortened 1998 – 99 season ) he started in all 40 games he played in , and averaged 7 @.@ 9 points , 2 @.@ 9 rebounds and 5 @.@ 5 assists per game . The 19 – 31 <unk> failed to make the playoffs but in the 1999 – 2000 season , the team 's prospects improved considerably . Nash missed 25 mid @-@ season games due to an ankle injury , but came back to record six double @-@ doubles in the last month of play . He finished the season with averages of 8 @.@ 6 points and 4 @.@ 9 assists per game . More importantly for the team , second @-@ year teammate and friend Dirk <unk> was <unk> quickly into a top player , veteran Michael Finley was having an All @-@ Star @-@ calibre year , and the team 's new owner , billionaire Mark Cuban , was bringing new energy and excitement to the franchise . Nash now had a supportive environment in which he could thrive . 
 Nash closely replicated his previous season 's performance in the 2002 – 03 season , averaging 17 @.@ 7 points and 7 @.@ 3 assists per game , again earning All @-@ Star and All @-@ NBA Third Team honours . <unk> and Nash led the <unk> from a 14 @-@ game winning streak to open the season all the way to the Western Conference Finals , where they lost to the eventual NBA champions , the San Antonio <unk> four games to two . It was only the second Conference Finals appearance in the franchise 's history . The 2003 – 04 season saw an <unk> boosted <unk> roster ( with the acquisitions of Antoine Walker and <unk> <unk> ) but a dip in Nash 's scoring contributions . As a result , he was not selected for the All @-@ Star and All @-@ NBA team <unk> even though he achieved new career highs in assists per game ( 8 @.@ 8 ) and free @-@ throw accuracy ( 91 @.@ 6 % ) . In the playoffs , the fifth @-@ <unk> Dallas failed to make progress yet again as the <unk> Kings saw them off four games to one . 
 After the 2003 – 04 season , Nash became a free agent . He attempted to negotiate a long @-@ term contract with Cuban , who was paying Walker , Finley , <unk> and <unk> nearly $ 50 million in combined salaries that season . Cuban wanted to build his franchise around the younger <unk> and did not want to risk signing the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Nash to a long @-@ term deal , and offered Nash a four @-@ year deal worth about $ 9 million annually , with a fifth year partially guaranteed . The Phoenix Suns on the other hand offered the point guard a six @-@ year , $ 63 million contract . Nash was reluctant to leave Dallas and returned to Cuban to see if he would match the deal ; Cuban did not , and Nash signed with the Suns for the 2004 – 05 season . The Canadian would go on to win two League MVP awards with Phoenix , and on a 14 June 2006 appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman , Cuban wondered out loud , " ... you know Steve 's a great guy and I love him to death , but why couldn 't he play like an MVP for us ? " 
 The next season , <unk> suffered a serious knee injury , and Johnson and Quentin Richardson were traded away . The Suns were not expected to repeat their successful 2005 season , but with Nash directing the same high @-@ tempo offence , the team compiled a respectable 54 – 28 record and won the division title . The Suns were again the highest @-@ scoring team in the league with seven players averaging double figures in points per game , and Nash was voted for the first time to start for the 2006 Western All @-@ Star team . Having recorded career highs in points ( 18 @.@ 8 ) , rebounds ( 4 @.@ 2 ) , field goal percentage ( <unk> ) and free @-@ throw percentage ( a league @-@ leading <unk> ) , and leading the league with 10 @.@ 5 assists per game , Nash was named the league MVP for the second year in a row . In the first round of the playoffs , Phoenix <unk> a 3 – 1 deficit against the Los Angeles <unk> and won the series 4 – 3 . The Los Angeles <unk> were their Conference <unk> opponents , and the Suns again needed seven games to clinch the series . For the second year in a row however , the Suns bowed out in the Conference Finals , this time to Nash 's former team , Dallas . 
 In the 2006 – 07 season , Nash had another stellar campaign , averaging 18 @.@ 6 points and a career @-@ high 11 @.@ 6 assists per game while becoming the first person since Magic Johnson in 1990 – 91 to average 18 points and 11 assists per game during the regular season . Nash received the most votes for first @-@ team All @-@ NBA and was joined by teammate <unk> ; the two were the first teammates to make the first team since Kobe Bryant and <unk> O <unk> in 2003 – 04 . Nash received 129 first @-@ place votes and 645 total points from the panel of 129 media members . He narrowly missed being MVP a third consecutive time , coming in second with 44 first place votes to 83 for Dirk <unk> . In the playoffs , the Suns eliminated the <unk> in five games before losing 4 – 2 to the <unk> in the Conference <unk> . 
 Nash played in 81 regular @-@ season games during the 2007 – 08 season ; in this campaign , the Western Conference was especially competitive and he led the Suns to 55 wins and the sixth seed for the 2008 NBA <unk> . Although there was a dip in his regular @-@ season output , Nash 's shooting remained sharp ; the accuracy of his shooting was on par with his 2005 – 06 MVP campaign ( shooting at least 50 % from the field , 40 % from the three @-@ point arc , and 90 % from the free throw line ) . On 31 January 2008 , he collected his All @-@ Star stripes for the sixth time in his career . However , Nash continued to experience <unk> in the playoffs . Despite a mid @-@ season trade that sent Shawn Marion to the Miami Heat and brought four @-@ time NBA champion <unk> O <unk> to the team , the Suns were defeated in the first round of the playoffs by the San Antonio <unk> for the third time in four years . In the deciding Game 5 , Nash was perceived to have suffered from " elimination @-@ game <unk> " , and turned over the ball twice in the final two minutes of what was a tight contest . Nevertheless , Nash was later named to the All @-@ NBA Second Team for the 2007 – 08 season . 
 Before the 2008 – 09 season began , coach D <unk> was replaced by Terry Porter , who preferred a more defensive @-@ oriented style of basketball . The Suns had difficulties adapting to this new system , and even a December trade involving sending <unk> Raja Bell and Boris <unk> to the Charlotte Bobcats for athletic <unk> Jason Richardson saw the team continue to struggle . Porter was then replaced by Alvin <unk> in February after a 28 – 23 record , but the Suns were unable to secure the final seed for the playoffs , resulting in Nash missing the playoffs for the first time since he returned to Phoenix for his second stint . 
 Nash and the Suns opened the 2009 – 10 season with a series of strong performances , going 8 – 1 in their first nine games ( a franchise @-@ best since 1980 – 81 ) , with Nash producing two 20 @-@ assists games . On 21 January 2010 , Nash was named as the starting point guard for the West for the 2010 NBA All @-@ Star Game . With him operating at the point , the Suns were the highest @-@ scoring team in the league for the fifth season in a row , and were <unk> third in the conference for the playoffs with 54 wins . Behind solid performances by Richardson and veteran Grant Hill , the Suns defeated the Portland Trail Blazers 4 – 2 in the first round of the playoffs , and swept the <unk> 4 – 0 in the second round . The Suns met the defending champions , Los Angeles <unk> , in the Conference Finals . After losing the first two games , Phoenix won the next two to tie the series . A Ron <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> in Game 5 pushed the <unk> one game closer to the Finals , and Kobe Bryant 's 37 points in Game 6 completed the defeat of the Suns . 
 In February 2012 , Nash was named to his eighth All @-@ Star Game . At the time , he was leading the NBA in assists per game . On 21 April 2012 , Nash passed Oscar Robertson for career assists versus the Denver <unk> . Despite his stellar play the Suns missed the playoffs for the second consecutive time . He finished the season averaging 12 @.@ 5 points and 10 @.@ 7 assists per game on 53 @.@ 2 % shooting from the field ( tying his career high ) . 
 On July 11 , 2012 , the Los Angeles <unk> acquired Nash in a sign @-@ and @-@ trade deal with Phoenix . Nash also considered signing with New York or Toronto , but he decided that Los Angeles was the best fit for him and his family . Nash switched his jersey number , as his customary No. 13 was retired by Los Angeles in honour of Wilt Chamberlain . Nash , an <unk> soccer fan , chose No. 10 to pay homage to Glenn <unk> , <unk> <unk> and other soccer <unk> who wore the number . Entering his 17th NBA season , Nash came to the <unk> with concerns over his defense and the health of his back . 
 In the second game of the 2012 – 13 season , Nash suffered a non @-@ displaced fracture in his left leg after a collision with Damian <unk> of the Portland Trail Blazers . He was expected to miss at least one week , but was out of the lineup for close to seven weeks . He was reunited with D <unk> , who took over as <unk> coach after Mike Brown was fired after a 1 – 4 start . On 22 December , Nash returned against the Golden State Warriors , helping the <unk> win their first overtime game of the season , 118 – 115 , scoring 12 points with 9 assists in 41 minutes of play . The <unk> won three of the first four games after Nash returned . However , they lost their next four , including a 125 – 112 loss to Houston on 8 January 2013 , when Nash assisted on an <unk> <unk> <unk> to become the fifth player in NBA history to reach 10 @,@ 000 career assists . 
 Kobe Bryant was moved to defend the opponent 's primary ball <unk> , freeing Nash from <unk> <unk> . Nash also struggled with Dwight Howard to run the pick and roll , a play that D <unk> had expected would be a staple for the <unk> . D <unk> moved Nash off the ball and made him more of a spot @-@ up shooter , while Bryant became the primary <unk> on offense . Nash missed the last eight games of the season with a right hip injury that also caused <unk> damage in his right hamstring . The team qualified for the playoffs as the seventh seed , but were swept 4 – 0 by San Antonio in the first round . Nash missed the last two games of the series after recurring issues with his hip and hamstring . In what he called arguably " the most frustrating " season of his career , Nash missed a career @-@ high 32 games in the regular season , and averaged his fewest assists ( 6 @.@ 7 ) since 1999 – 2000 , when he was a part @-@ time starter with Dallas . 
 During 2013 – 14 season , Nash continued to suffer <unk> problems stemming from his leg injury the prior season . In November , he was sidelined for an estimated minimum of two weeks due to <unk> root irritation . Nash returned on February 4 , 2014 , shooting 3 @-@ for @-@ 6 for 7 points . On February 7 , 2014 , his 40th birthday , he scored a season @-@ high 19 points in a victory over the Philadelphia 76ers . On March 13 , Nash was ruled out for the remainder of the season by D <unk> . He was suffering from a recurrence of <unk> problems stemming from an earlier collision to his left leg with Chicago 's Kirk <unk> , and the <unk> wanted to give Kendall Marshall and Jordan <unk> more playing time . However , Nash returned on March 21 after a groin injury to <unk> that was expected to <unk> him a minimum of two weeks . 
 In July 2014 , Nash announced that the 2014 – 15 season would be his last . During the preseason , he experienced back pain , and further aggravated his back while lifting luggage . On 23 October , less than a week before the start of what would have been the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Nash 's 19th year in the NBA , he was ruled out for the season due to a recurring back injury . Nash only played in three preseason games before he started to feel more pain in his back . Nash on injuring his back : " Being on the court this season has been my top priority , and it is disappointing to not be able to do that right now . I work very hard to stay healthy , and unfortunately my recent setback makes performing at full capacity difficult . I will continue to support my team during this period of rest and will focus on my long @-@ term health . " 
 Nash announced his retirement from playing on March 21 , 2015 . Before the announcement , the Cleveland Cavaliers had said to Nash 's agent that they were interested in him as a backup for <unk> Irving if Nash asked for a buyout . Nash refused it , due to both his health concerns and wanting to retire as a <unk> in gratitude for the opportunity given by the club . Nash was later on approached by another former team of his , the Dallas <unk> , to have one last season with them instead , but he declined due to his aforementioned health concerns . 
 On September 25 , 2015 , it was confirmed that Nash would take on part @-@ time consulting duties for the Golden State Warriors . 
 In the early 1990s , Nash was cut from the Canadian junior national team by head coach Ken <unk> , father of future NBA player Kelly <unk> . At age 17 , he was the youngest member of Team Canada at the 1991 World University Games , where the team won a silver medal . 
 In 1993 , while in college , he played for the senior national team at the Tournament of the Americas and competed in the Canada Games ( for the British Columbia team ) and World University Games . He won a bronze medal at the Canada Games and won a silver medal at the World University Games , losing to Team USA in a closely contested final , which included players such as Michael Finley and Damon <unk> . 
 At the 1999 Tournament of the Americas , Nash led Canada to the silver medal , qualifying the team for the Olympics for the first time in 12 years ; he was named tournament MVP . Nash captained Canada at the 2000 Sydney Olympics . He led Canada to win their round robin group with a victory over Spain and a stunning 83 – 75 win over favoured Yugoslavia when he scored 26 points with eight rebounds and eight assists . Canada was eliminated in the quarterfinals with a five @-@ point loss to France and Nash left the court in tears . Nash expressed disappointment with the result , saying " It <unk> a lot . I feel like I let everybody down . We could have been in the championship game . We were good enough . " Nevertheless , he did see a possible silver lining , saying " <unk> kids [ in Canada ] will be inspired to play — that 's what I really hope . " A victory in its final game of the tournament , a placement game against Russia , enabled Canada to salvage seventh place . Nash 's Olympic performance propelled him to stardom in Canada and he finished fifth in voting for the 2000 Lionel <unk> Award , which is handed out to the Canadian male athlete of the year . 
 Nash again led Team Canada during qualifying for the 2004 Summer Olympics at the FIBA Americas Olympic Qualifying Tournament in San Juan , Puerto Rico . He led the tournament in assists and was named tournament MVP , but Canada finished fourth , missing out on the three Olympic spots available . That was the last time Nash played for Canada ; he was reportedly upset about the firing of head coach Jay <unk> in 2004 . In December 2007 , he said , " In my mind right now , I 'm not going to play for Canada any more . " 
 On May 8 , 2012 , Nash became General Manager of the Canadian senior national team . Three months later , he <unk> <unk> as head coach . 
 Nash is most noted for his <unk> , ball @-@ handling skills and shooting . He led the league in assists for five years , averaging 11 @.@ 5 assists per game in 2004 – 05 , 10 @.@ 5 in 2005 – 06 , 11 @.@ 6 in 2006 – 07 , 11 @.@ 0 in 2009 – 10 and 11 @.@ 4 in 2010 – 11 and won the 2005 and 2010 NBA All @-@ Star <unk> <unk> . As of the end of 2012 – 13 season , he had a 90 @.@ 4 % career free @-@ throw shooting average ( best in NBA history ) and a 42 @.@ 8 % career three @-@ point shooting average ( eighth @-@ best in league history ) , and ranked as one of the top 10 players in league history in total assists , assists per game , and three @-@ point field goals made . In addition , he is ranked second ( starting from 1986 – 87 ) in regular season point @-@ assist double doubles . In the 2005 – 06 season , Nash became the fourth player in NBA history to shoot 50 % or better from the field , 40 % from three @-@ point range ( 43 @.@ 9 ) , and 90 % from the line , joining Larry Bird , <unk> Miller , and Mark Price in the 50 – 40 – 90 Club . Nash would repeat this feat three more times in the 2007 – 08 , 2008 – 09 and 2009 – 10 campaigns . Nash ( four times ) and Larry Bird ( two times ) are the only players to have accomplished this feat more than once . A two @-@ time NBA MVP , Nash is only the second point guard ( along with Magic Johnson ) to win the MVP award multiple times and the third guard in NBA history to earn back @-@ to @-@ back MVPs ( joining Johnson and Michael Jordan ) . Only ten other NBA players have won back @-@ to @-@ back MVP awards : Johnson , Jordan , Bill Russell , Wilt Chamberlain , Kareem Abdul @-@ Jabbar , Moses Malone , Larry Bird , Tim Duncan , LeBron James , and Stephen Curry . On 11 May 2006 , ESPN.com rated Nash as the 9th @-@ best point guard of all time , and in a survey by <unk> in 2007 , Nash received 85 % of the votes by the league 's general managers as best point guard in the league . In a similar survey in 2009 , Nash was rated as the best passer of the ball and the player possessing the best basketball <unk> . Commenting on Nash losing out to former teammate Dirk <unk> for the 2007 NBA MVP , Boston Celtics centre and Hall of Famer Russell stated : " I think , on the world stage , he 's one of our great athletes in all sports ... I 'm a big fan . The two MVPs he got , he deserved . Part of the reason that he 's so good and so effective is that the guys like playing with him . He creates an atmosphere where they win games . " 
 In terms of specific skills , Nash was particularly effective playing the pick and roll , notably with <unk> when he was with the <unk> and later with the Suns ' <unk> <unk> <unk> and Shawn Marion . When Nash returned to Phoenix in 2004 , he helped the Suns improve from a 29 – 53 record in 2003 – 04 to 62 – 20 in 2004 – 05 , reaching the Conference Finals for the first time in 11 years , earning him his first MVP award . The next season , he led the Suns into the Conference Finals , despite the injuries of all three big men ( <unk> , Kurt Thomas and Brian Grant ) ; further , Nash was responsible for seven of his teammates attaining career @-@ highs in season scoring . With Nash operating at the point , between the 2005 – 06 and 2009 – 10 seasons , the Suns led the league in field goal percentage .

 In 2001 , Nash met <unk> <unk> in Manhattan . They married in June 2005 and had twin daughters , <unk> and Bella , born on 14 October 2004 , . and a son , <unk> , born 12 November 2010 . On the day of his son 's birth , Nash made a statement to Life & Style in which he announced the birth but called it a " <unk> moment " , revealing that he and his wife had " lived separately for the past several months " and are " in the process of dissolving " their marriage . 
 Nash 's younger brother , Martin , played soccer for the Vancouver <unk> FC and made 30 appearances for the Canadian national soccer team . Their younger sister , <unk> , was the captain of the University of Victoria <unk> women 's soccer team for three years and was named a Canada West Universities Athletic Association All @-@ Star . She is married to professional ice hockey player Manny <unk> . 
 Nash has a medical condition called <unk> , which causes muscle tightness and back pain . Due to the condition , when he is not in the game he lies on his back rather than sitting on the bench to keep his muscles from <unk> . 
 In 2001 , Nash formed the Steve Nash Foundation . Through grants to public service and <unk> entities , the foundation aims to foster health in kids by funding projects that provide services to children affected by poverty , illness , abuse , or neglect , and create opportunity for education , play , and <unk> . It focuses its resources on communities in Phoenix , Arizona , and British Columbia , Canada . It was given charitable status in 2004 . This foundation was awarded the Steve Patterson Award for Excellence in Sports <unk> in 2008 .

 Nash grew up playing soccer — he stated in a 2005 interview that he could have played professionally if he had focused on it — and continues to hold an interest in the sport . When Dirk <unk> arrived in the NBA from Germany , he and Nash became close friends , in part because they enjoyed watching soccer together . Nash is friends with several professional soccer players , including Alessandro Del <unk> , <unk> Henry , Owen <unk> , <unk> <unk> and Steve McManaman .

 U.S. Route 80 ( US 80 ) was a U.S. highway in California that continued east across the country to Georgia . The western terminus was in San Diego , California , and US 80 continued east through the city on several different <unk> through the years . The highway went through the <unk> Mountains , encountering many <unk> , before descending to El <unk> . After passing through the sand dunes , the highway crossed the Colorado River into <unk> , Arizona . 
 The highway replaced a 1912 plank road across much of Imperial County . The winding two @-@ lane road through the <unk> Mountains was one of the factors that led to a four @-@ hour journey from San Diego to El <unk> . During the 1930s , the road was realigned through the mountains , but several curves remained . In the 1950s , work began on constructing what would become Interstate 8 ( I @-@ 8 ) to replace the old highway in San Diego to bypass the cities of San Diego , La Mesa , and El <unk> . This started with the construction of the <unk> Canyon road as well as Mission Valley Road through the San Diego area , as well as construction a replacement for the old highway across the <unk> Grade . The construction continued across the rest of the route through the next two decades . US 80 was gradually decommissioned after 1964 as I @-@ 8 , through San Diego and Imperial counties , was completed . In 2006 , the highway was designated by the California State Legislature as Historic U.S. Route 80 . 
 There were multiple <unk> through the downtown San Diego area . The route as of 1928 began at Broadway ( US 101 ) and ran along 4th Avenue north to University Avenue in the <unk> district , then went east on University Avenue . By 1933 , the routing had shifted to use Park Boulevard south of University Avenue into downtown , to end at Market Street ; the city council voted that July to use University Avenue west of Park Boulevard to connect to US 101 , to obtain federal funding for improving that road . The next year , the Point <unk> highway was referred to as the western terminus of US 80 by <unk> Wallace , a district highway engineer . Nevertheless , the state @-@ produced highway maps from the next few years did not reflect the change , or this choice of the western terminus . 
 Route 12 was added to the state highway system in 1909 from San Diego to El <unk> , and Route 27 was added from El <unk> to <unk> in 1915 . Before a highway was constructed through the Imperial San <unk> , travelers had to pass to the north in order to reach <unk> . The first route through Imperial Valley was originally a plank road made of pieces of wood that were tied together . The road was completed by October 1912 , and portions were still visible into the 2010s . The Ocean @-@ to @-@ Ocean Bridge across the Colorado River was open in 1915 , and a new plank road was opened that year which became state @-@ maintained in 1917 , and used a foundation of wooden rails , with the <unk> bound together by steel , as opposed to simple <unk> that were <unk> to rails . However , traffic congestion and dusty conditions made travel along the plank road difficult . The delay in constructing a road to San Diego caused increased development in Los Angeles and resulted in that city becoming the trade and population center of Southern California . 
 A <unk> road existed into the 19th century that passed through the mountains east of San Diego . Construction was discussed as early as 1911 , with The San Diego Union and Daily Bee saying that it " will be one of the best in the system . " Well before the freeway was constructed , the automobile road through the mountains east of San Diego was narrow and wound through the mountains ; it was officially dedicated in 1912 . This trip was known to take up to four hours , and frequently resulted in the <unk> boiling over , flat <unk> , or broken fan belts ; recent <unk> weather would result in cars becoming <unk> in the mud . But meanwhile , Colonel Ed Fletcher declared the road a " success " , and indicated his belief that a concrete road from San Diego to <unk> would soon follow , responding to criticism that a road from Los Angeles to <unk> should have been built . 
 US 80 was designated on November 11 , 1926 , along with the rest of the U.S. Routes . The asphalt road was constructed through the valley as the main east – west route , and was open by 1927 . Another road was constructed in the early 1930s , to remove curves and widen the lanes . The result was a two @-@ lane road that still had many <unk> , with one popularly known as " Dead Man 's <unk> " . Planning for this new alignment was underway in 1932 , and much of the work was to be located at the <unk> Grade , and at the segment just west of <unk> . <unk> continued on US 80 into 1934 , just west of the sand dunes . 
 Meanwhile , Imperial County businessmen hoped to promote the use of this road over the route from Phoenix to Los Angeles , to increase tourism . Eventually , US 80 did become the most used road into Southern California from the east , but by 1947 , the Highway 80 Associated was formed to increase the traffic on the road , since the war and advertising by other cities had caused it to fall again . Four years later , US 80 was reported to be the most used <unk> highway , and there was a 40 percent increase in the out @-@ of @-@ state cars that traveled through the state inspection station at <unk> during the first three months of that year . But in 1954 , there were reports that traffic had decreased , because the road to Phoenix , Arizona from <unk> , New Mexico had improved . 
 Starting in 1932 , county and state officials proposed <unk> US 80 away from what is now La Mesa Boulevard . Although the city raised concerns about the proposal , due to the shift in transportation design towards " free @-@ access highways " where vehicles could travel up to 60 miles per hour ( 97 km / h ) , and the success of the <unk> <unk> Parkway in Los Angeles , the La Mesa Scout newspaper withdrew their objections to the construction . In the meantime , parts of El <unk> Boulevard through downtown El <unk> were widened in 1935 . Federal funds were allocated for <unk> US 80 in 1940 ; by then , La Mesa Boulevard had been designated as a U.S. 80 Business Route , and El <unk> Boulevard then carried the US 80 designation to San Diego . But in 1947 , the San Diego Highway Development Association criticized the proliferation of traffic signals and businesses on El <unk> Boulevard , during the discussion of how to resolve traffic issues on US 101 through <unk> . 
 World War II stalled most freeway projects in the San Diego area . Plans were developed by 1946 for a freeway through <unk> Canyon that would connect with the <unk> Freeway . Funding was obtained by 1949 for the 5 @.@ 4 miles ( 8 @.@ 7 km ) portion between 70th Street and Lake Murray Boulevard , and <unk> Avenue . The first portion of the <unk> Canyon Highway , the first freeway thorough La Mesa , was opened in early 1950 . Reports indicated that this decreased the time to travel from La Mesa to San Diego by a factor of two , with 7 @,@ 000 trips on the route each day . That same year , the San Diego city manager expressed concerns at the Highway Commission meeting about shifting US 80 away from El <unk> Boulevard to the <unk> Canyon and Mission Valley Road route , due to the potential loss of commerce for businesses located near the current route . 
 In 1948 , the Highway 80 Chamber of Commerce president complained that funds were being <unk> for US 395 construction , instead of on US 80 . In September , the county supervisors approved the Mission Valley road as a limited access highway , but held off on processing the results from surveying . The next month , $ 1 million was allocated to the realignment of the <unk> grade , namely , increasing the radius of the curves from 300 feet ( 91 m ) to 2 @,@ 000 feet ( 610 m ) , as well as limiting the grade to 4 percent . By 1949 , the project was under way , with prisoners contributing to the labor force , and was projected to include a tunnel as well as several <unk> of the <unk> River . A longer 34 miles ( 55 km ) tunnel through the <unk> Mountains was also proposed that year , which would have been the longest in the world . But by 1950 , work on the <unk> grade had stalled , due to the prison labor camp being shut down ; efforts were then made to start work again . More funds were allocated by the State Highway Commission a few months later , and the work was to be put out for bid to complete the project . 
 Meanwhile , construction continued on the western part of the US 80 freeway . On August 27 , 1951 , the final link in the new freeway between Point <unk> and La Mesa was dedicated . The next year , planning continued for the possibility of a freeway bypass of El <unk> that would connect to the existing US 80 freeway . However , many El <unk> Boulevard <unk> owners raised objections over the <unk> of the US 80 designation to the new freeway , as it would potentially harm business . In response , the Highway Development Association proposed designating El <unk> Boulevard as a business route . But in order to obtain funding for the construction , the new route would have to be added to the state highway system by the California State Legislature , or be designated as US 80 . Later , a Freeway 80 Association was formed to encourage public support for the construction of the bypass of El <unk> , and the conversion of the <unk> Canyon and Mission Valley roads into a freeway . Following the city of San Diego council and county approval , the California State Assembly transportation committee heard complaints from citizens claiming that they had not been adequately notified about the plans for US 80 or SR 94 , or given enough time to provide input . 
 In April 1955 , a Caltrans official announced that US 80 would be built as a freeway for its entire length in California , as it was to be included in the Interstate Highway System . In the meantime , while plans moved further along on US 101 , the mayor of San Diego asked the California Highway Commission to keep the US 80 project on track . However , the construction was put on hold because of lower traffic levels on US 80 , compared to other local highways . State <unk> <unk> raised the issue in the Assembly Highway <unk> in December , stating that the construction of the freeway would help the economy and the Port of San Diego . State Senator <unk> went even further and blamed the delay on San Diego County officials , in addition to linking the delay to damaging the program to develop the port . The bridge over the Colorado River was replaced in 1956 , at a cost of $ 1 @.@ 2 million , and was in use until 1978 , when the I @-@ 8 bridge was built . 
 Finally , in May 1957 , bids opened for the part of US 80 between <unk> Boulevard in La Mesa and Chase Avenue in El <unk> , that would connect to the new SR 67 freeway . <unk> took place on June 10 , and the project was to cost $ 3 @.@ 6 million . The rebuilding of the <unk> Freeway interchange became a priority due to the availability of federal funding , and due to the traffic problems encountered with having ramps entering from both the left and the right . In July , the Highway Development Association decided to formally raise the issue of the incomplete highway survey through Imperial County at the next California Highway Commission meeting . In 1958 , federal funds were allocated to construct US 80 from Taylor Street to <unk> Avenue as an eight @-@ lane freeway , and from there to 70th Street as a divided highway . In August , the state announced that there were four proposed routes for US 80 through the mountains , including one with a tunnel . A contract was later awarded to construct the freeway from Taylor Street to the <unk> Freeway at a cost of $ 1 @.@ 2 million . In November , Caltrans announced that the Walker Canyon route had been chosen for US 80 , which would allow for the route to be constructed in stages , as well as being the least expensive alternative . 
 By the end of the year , plans were being made for construction of the freeway between <unk> Drive east of El <unk> and <unk> Junction , and the portion of the freeway from <unk> Avenue to Lake Murray Boulevard was contracted for $ 2 @.@ 6 million . In January 1960 , the Taylor Street to <unk> Freeway portions were under construction , including the interchange at the latter , and were scheduled to be complete by October , while the <unk> Freeway to <unk> Avenue portion was up for bid ; the next month , the contract was awarded for $ 4 @.@ 6 million , with interchanges to be constructed at Texas Street and Ward Road to replace traffic signals . In July , the new I @-@ 8 designation for the road was announced , and plans to post signs were made . Another contract for the portion from <unk> Summit near Chase Avenue to Ballantyne Avenue was awarded for $ 2 @.@ 7 million in November . 
 But in 1960 , Jacob <unk> , the district highway engineer , stated that due to lower traffic on US 80 , the completion of the freeway through the mountains would be delayed until at least 1971 . Construction of the section of US 80 from Magnolia Avenue to Third Street was contracted for $ 2 @.@ 7 million in April . That year , work continued on the freeway , and in August , only one traffic signal was left on the highway west of El <unk> , at Ward Road . In August , <unk> announced that bids for the portion between Lake Murray Boulevard and Third Street would be opened the following month ; once that was completed , the entire freeway west of El <unk> would be complete . <unk> lanes between US 395 and <unk> Avenue opened on November 23 . 
 The portion from the <unk> summit to Magnolia Avenue and SR 67 was completed in April 1961 . By August , the entirety of the freeway west of El <unk> was complete , with the exception of the portions from near Lake Murray Boulevard to near La Mesa Boulevard for $ 3 @.@ 1 million , as well as between Magnolia Avenue and the El <unk> eastern city limits for $ 2 @.@ 7 million . In addition to this , the part of the freeway from near Grays Well to <unk> Road in Imperial County was also being constructed for $ 2 @.@ 3 million . The 2 @.@ 3 miles ( 3 @.@ 7 km ) freeway portion east of Magnolia Avenue that connected with the undivided US 80 opened on September 6 . The final section in La Mesa was completed in April 1962 . Construction started on the Mountain Springs portion of US 80 in September 1962 . That year , US 80 west of the <unk> Freeway interchange was declared to be the busiest road in the City of San Diego , at 71 @,@ 000 daily vehicles . 
 US 80 was removed from the state highway system in the 1964 state highway renumbering when I @-@ 80 was designated ; I @-@ 8 assumed the routing from San Diego to El <unk> and <unk> . However , US 80 signs were posted for several years afterward on the remaining portions of the original asphalt road that had not been bypassed by the freeway . The <unk> formally recognized California 's requested elimination of US 80 by 1969 . Gradually , the route was removed from Arizona , New Mexico and part of Texas between 1977 and 1991 . After the freeway was built , the population of <unk> went from 400 to 200 , and many businesses closed or relocated . However , the population began to increase after a few years , and residents began <unk> to jobs in El <unk> and San Diego . Following a campaign from the local Old Highway 80 Committee and endorsement from the San Diego County Board of Supervisors , the California State Legislature passed a resolution allowing for the route to be designated and signed as a state historic route , Historic U.S. Route 80 , in 2006 . 
 <unk> 's <unk> Edition is a series of fan <unk> of the first three films in the George Lucas @-@ created Star Wars franchise : Star Wars , The Empire <unk> Back and Return of the <unk> . The <unk> were created by a team of Star Wars fans led by <unk> " <unk> " <unk> , an English teacher from <unk> , Czech Republic . The original Star Wars trilogy was released theatrically by 20th Century Fox for Lucasfilm between 1977 and 1983 . Subsequent releases on home media , such as the 1997 " Special Edition " releases , introduced significant changes to the films , including additional scenes and new computer @-@ generated imagery – these changes were met with a mixed response from critics . As of 2014 , the films are no longer widely available in their original theatrical releases . 
 <unk> felt that altering the films in this way constituted " an act of cultural vandalism " , and in 2010 was inspired to create his own series of fan <unk> that restored the theatrical releases in high @-@ definition . With no experience in professional film editing , he taught himself as he went , using programs such as <unk> and <unk> After Effects . Taking the 1993 <unk> releases as a guide and a majority of source material from the 2011 Blu @-@ ray releases , <unk> and a team of eight other fans constructed the <unk> over many thousands of hours of work . In 2011 , one year after the project had begun , the first version of <unk> 's <unk> Edition was published online . Updated versions have been created in the years that followed . 
 As a fan edit , <unk> 's <unk> Edition cannot be legally bought or sold , and is " to be shared among legal owners of the officially available releases only " . Consequently , the films are only available via various <unk> <unk> . Reaction to the project has been positive : Nathan Barry of Wired praised the films as " an absolute joy to watch " , while Gizmodo described them as " very , very good " . Sean Hutchinson of <unk> placed <unk> 's <unk> Edition at number one on his list of the best Star Wars fan <unk> and called them " the perfect pre @-@ 1997 way to experience the saga " . 
 The original Star Wars trilogy was a Lucasfilm production released theatrically by 20th Century Fox between 1977 and 1983 , and was subsequently released on home media during the 1980s and 1990s . The films were distributed by CBS / Fox Video on several formats , such as VHS , <unk> and <unk> . In 1997 , to coincide with the 20th anniversary of Star Wars , Lucas <unk> new cuts of the trilogy to theaters , naming them the " Special <unk> " . The Special <unk> made a number of changes to the original releases , including additions such as enhanced digital effects , previously unreleased scenes , and entirely new CGI sequences . 
 Reaction to the new cuts was mixed , with commentators criticising unnecessary additions such as a computer @-@ generated <unk> the <unk> in the first film and a new musical number in Return of the <unk> ; an alteration involving the <unk> hunter <unk> shooting at Han Solo drew significant ire . Further changes to the series were added to the 2004 DVD and the 2011 Blu @-@ ray releases – these changes also drew criticism . The final release of the original cuts was in 2006 , when <unk> masters used for the 1993 <unk> were added as a bonus feature to a limited run of DVDs under the name George 's Original <unk> Trilogy ( <unk> ) . In 2010 , Lucas stated that bringing the original cuts to Blu @-@ ray would be a " very , very expensive " process ; as of 2014 , the films are only widely available in their altered versions . 
 As a result of these changes , a group of fans met on various Internet forums to construct higher quality cuts as fan <unk> by using the available home media and blending the Special Edition DVDs with the <unk> transfers . One such edit for The Empire <unk> Back was created by Star Wars fan <unk> . 
 The legal standing of <unk> 's <unk> Edition is contentious . As fan <unk> , the cuts <unk> a line between Fair Use and copyright infringement . <unk> states that the <unk> are " made for culturally historical and educational purposes " and that they are " to be shared among legal owners of the officially available releases only " . Consequently , the films are only available via various <unk> <unk> . <unk> himself remarked : " I 'm convinced that 99 % of people who download this already bought Star Wars 10 times over on DVD . " As of November 2015 , he has received no legal issues from Lucasfilm over the <unk> Edition . 
 The series was shot on location in the English counties of Berkshire , Surrey , Buckinghamshire and Devon for two months from April 2007 . <unk> and <unk> was co @-@ produced by the BBC and American studio <unk> Boston . It was aired in three parts from 1 January 2008 in the United Kingdom and attracted an average of 6 million viewers per episode . The first episode also became one of the top ten most <unk> programmes on the BBC <unk> . <unk> and <unk> garnered mostly positive reviews from television critics , while the cast and crew earned several award nominations for their work . It was released on a two @-@ disc DVD in the UK on 14 January 2008 . 
 During a welcome dinner at Barton Park , Sir John introduces the <unk> to his wife , Lady Middleton ( <unk> <unk> ) ; her mother , Mrs. Jennings ( Linda <unk> ) ; and their family friend , Colonel Brandon ( David <unk> ) . Brandon instantly falls in love with <unk> , but she believes he is too old for her . While out walking with Margaret , <unk> falls and twists her ankle . She is rescued by a young man , who carries her back to the cottage . He introduces himself as John Willoughby ( Dominic Cooper ) , and states that he will return to check on <unk> the following day . Brandon also comes to visit , but upon seeing Willoughby , he quickly departs . Willoughby and <unk> grow close through their mutual love of poetry , and he later takes a lock of her hair . Mrs. <unk> and Elinor begin to speculate on whether they have become secretly engaged . 
 On 5 October 2005 , a reporter for the BBC News revealed that writer Andrew Davies was planning to adapt Jane Austen 's <unk> and <unk> into a major television drama due to be broadcast on the BBC in two years . Davies commented , " When they are great stories , you keep on coming back to them and doing them in different ways with different people at different lengths . " Davies explained that his script was in the early stages and that no actors had yet been cast . The writer later expressed his delight at adapting the novel during an interview with Paul Carey from the Western Mail , calling Austen his " favourite novelist " . He also admitted that due to the acclaim he received for his adaptation of Pride and <unk> , there was pressure on him to get <unk> and <unk> right . Davies later stated that the aim of the miniseries was to make viewers forget about <unk> Lee 's 1995 film adaptation of the novel . 
 The opening episode of <unk> and <unk> features the moment Willoughby <unk> Eliza , a young <unk> . Davies told Carey and Claire Hill from the Western Mail that he wanted " to do justice " to Willoughby 's back story , saying that it is " quite interesting and <unk> stuff like a lot of <unk> sex that goes on and is just talked about . I want to put it on the screen . " Davies elaborated on this further in an interview with The Independent 's Peter Chapman , saying that the seduction and abandonment of a <unk> in the novel needed <unk> . He believed readers " hardly notice " the moment , which he felt was very important . The writer noted that the series was " more overtly sexual " than previous adaptations of Austen 's works and added , " The novel is as much about sex and money as social conventions . " Davies also included a duel between Colonel Brandon and Willoughby in his screenplay , an event that was absent from Lee 's film adaptation of the novel . 
 Davies believed that Lee 's film did not overcome " the problem of the guys who get the girls not <unk> quite good enough " , and set out to try to find a way of making them into heroes in his script . He said that Austen should have made the reader feel that Edward was worthy of Elinor and explained how <unk> falls in love with Colonel Brandon , after having her heart broken by Willoughby . The writer increased the male roles , so they could be turned into stronger characters . Davies told Hill that the team " worked very hard " on the men . Brandon is seen rescuing people and doing a lot of fast horse riding , while Edward was given a wood @-@ <unk> scene where he <unk> his <unk> about his engagement . Davies also made the <unk> sisters younger and " more vulnerable " than how they were portrayed in Lee 's film . <unk> <unk> , who portrayed Elinor in the drama , stated , " We are trying to play the story as it was written . In the novel the girls are 19 and 17 , so these romantic relationships are real rites of passage for them . " 
 Davies commented that he would have liked to have been in charge of the casting . He revealed that he had initially objected to <unk> <unk> being cast in the role of the eldest <unk> sister , Elinor . However , he was glad that his objections were ignored , because he fell in love with her performance . <unk> told The Daily Telegraph 's Jasper Rees that she deliberately chose not to watch the 1995 film adaptation of <unk> and <unk> or think about Emma Thompson 's portrayal of the character . She explained that she had not " [ b ] <unk> you would go mad . It would <unk> your work . I thought , it 'll be original by virtue of the fact that it 's me doing it and there is only one me . " 
 Charity Wakefield successfully auditioned for the role of <unk> <unk> . The actress revealed , " <unk> is the embodiment of youth and hope . I was so excited to be offered the part because I felt that it was a role which I could really attack . I understand her character and feel that we have lots in common . " Dan Stevens was chosen to play Edward <unk> , Elinor 's love interest . The actor revealed to a BBC journalist that he had really wanted the part and was excited by the challenge of the character . Stevens became ill with <unk> during the shoot , and <unk> that there are very few shots of him in full health still in the series . 
 David <unk> portrayed Colonel Brandon . The actor was sent the script by his agent , and he initially questioned whether another Austen adaptation was needed . However , he then read the script and thought it was " just brilliant " , especially as Davies had added more scenes featuring the male characters . Dominic Cooper took on the role of John Willoughby , Brandon 's rival for <unk> 's affections . Describing his character , Cooper said " The way I tried to persuade myself he wasn 't too bad was that he 's a 25 @-@ year @-@ old young guy and he genuinely falls in love with <unk> – he 's not just doing it for one moment in time . " Cooper said that he had fun working on the project . 
 Willoughby 's wardrobe was designed to reflect his " poetic " and " fashionable " nature , while Fordham believed Edward was more suited to the eighteenth @-@ century rural colours . With Colonel Brandon being a stronger character , his costumes were half way between the two . His clothes were designed to be out of date and firm , using more <unk> instead of the rural colours . The production had an emphasis on youth and passion , which Clapton incorporated into her work . The designer said , " Ten years ago , female characters in 19th @-@ century dramas would all have their hair done in very precise <unk> , all <unk> and perfect just like in the portraits . Now we 're trying to achieve a more <unk> , natural look , especially when the <unk> are at home . " She added that the director had wanted the characters to " feel more human . " <unk> commented that the period costumes were " slightly uncomfortable " for modern life , but as soon as the cast were riding horses or walking across fields , they realised why they were made that way . He added , " When you 're dancing , they 're quite restrictive , but that 's quite good for posture – posture was different then , and that 's important . But they give you a feel for the character which is really an advantage to you as an actor . " 
 <unk> and <unk> was released on a two @-@ disc DVD in the UK on 14 January 2008 . All three episodes were given away free with a copy of the Daily Mail in 2009 . The offer was part of the newspaper 's British Classics collection . The Region 1 DVD was released a few days after its premiere on PBS . The two @-@ disc set also included the BBC 's Miss Austen <unk> , as well as commentary and interviews from the cast and crew . 
 The first episode of <unk> and <unk> attracted 5 @.@ 54 million viewers upon its first broadcast in the United Kingdom , giving it twenty per cent of the audience share for its broadcast time . The second episode posted a small increase of 5 @.@ 74 million viewers , while the concluding part attracted an audience of 6 @.@ 76 million . 
 <unk> and <unk> received mostly positive reviews from critics . However , the Jane Austen Society criticised it for being " too <unk> " and accused Davies of " degrading fine English literature " , after he included a seduction scene in the opening episode . The chairman of the society , Patrick Stokes , stated , " <unk> this story up says more about the BBC than Jane Austen . It is lowering itself by degrading fine English literature in the battle for ratings . While it is good that it draws people 's attention to her works , there is not a lot you can do if someone makes a <unk> of it . " A BBC spokesman believed the drama was not overtly sexual and stated that they had received no complaints about it , though they did get several calls from viewers expressing their appreciation for the series . 
 <unk> drew inspiration from miniature golf , racing games , and artwork by M. C. <unk> . He applied a <unk> approach in designing the appearance of the game 's courses and enemies . 
 <unk> Madness was commercially successful . The game was ported to numerous platforms and inspired the development of other games . A sequel was developed and planned for release in 1991 , but canceled when location testing showed the game could not compete with other titles . 
 <unk> Madness is an isometric platform game in which the player manipulates an <unk> marble from a third @-@ person perspective . The player controls the marble 's movements with a <unk> , though most home versions use game controllers with directional pads . The aim of the game is for the player to complete six maze @-@ like , isometric race courses before a set amount of time <unk> . With the exception of the first race , any time left on the clock at the end of a race is carried over to the next one , and the player is granted a set amount of additional time as well . The game allows two players to compete against each other , <unk> bonus points and extra time to the winner of each race ; both players have separate clocks . 
 As the game progresses , the courses become increasingly difficult and introduce more enemies and obstacles . Each course has a distinct visual theme . For example , the first race ( titled " Practice " ) is a simple course that is much shorter than the others , while the fifth race ( named " <unk> " ) features polka @-@ dot patterns and is oriented in a direction opposite that of the other courses . 
 <unk> Madness was commercially successful following its December 1984 release and was positively received by critics . Around 4 @,@ 000 <unk> were sold , and it soon became the highest @-@ earning game in arcades . However , the game consistently fell from this ranking during its seventh week in arcades that <unk> tracked the game 's success . <unk> attributed the six @-@ week arcade life to <unk> Madness 's short gameplay length . He believed that players lost interest after mastering it and moved on to other games . The arcade <unk> have since become fairly rare . Stan <unk> holds the official world record of 187 @,@ 880 points . 
 Bruce Webster of <unk> wrote that the graphics of the Amiga version of <unk> Madness in December 1986 " are really amazing " . While criticizing the lack of a pause function or a top scores list , he stated that it " is definitely worth having if you own an Amiga " . Many reviewers felt that the high level of skill required to play the game was part of its appeal . In 2008 , Levi Buchanan of IGN listed <unk> Madness as one of several titles in his " dream arcade " , citing the game 's difficulty and the fond memories he had playing it . Author John Sellers wrote that difficulty was a major reason that players were attracted . Other engaging factors included the graphics , visual design , and the soundtrack . <unk> Gamer 's Craig <unk> , in referring to the game as one of the most distinctive arcade games ever made , praised its visuals as " pure and <unk> " . In 2008 , Guinness World Records listed it as the number seventy @-@ nine arcade game in technical , creative , and cultural impact . <unk> Madness was one of the first games to use true <unk> sound and have a recognizable musical score . British composer Paul Weir commented that the music had character and helped give the game a unique identity . A common complaint about the arcade cabinet was that the track ball controls frequently broke from repeated use . 
 <unk> Madness inspired other games that feature similar gameplay based on navigating a ball through progressively more difficult courses ; such games are often described in terms that relate them to <unk> Madness . Melbourne House 's <unk> and Electric Dreams Software 's <unk> were the first such games ; both met with a good reception . In 1990 , Rare released Snake Rattle ' n ' Roll , which incorporated elements similar to <unk> Madness . The Super Monkey Ball series uses similar gameplay based on rolling a ball , but adds other features such as minigames and monkey characters . Archer Maclean 's Mercury also contains many elements similar to <unk> Madness , but with minor variations , including the ability to change color , added <unk> , and that the player controls a <unk> of liquid mercury rather than a marble . 
 <unk> created prototypes for location testing , but the game did not fare well against more popular titles at the time such as Street Fighter II . <unk> assumed the track balls accounted for the poor reception and commissioned a second model with joystick controls . Because the new models were met with the same poor reception , production was halted and the focus shifted to <unk> of the ' Hood , a beat ' em up game . The prototypes that were produced have since become collector items . 
 After an unremarkable school career , <unk> briefly worked for his father 's mining company in Austria , where the family had moved in 1914 . He worked as a travelling oil salesman beginning in 1927 , and joined the Nazi Party and SS in 1932 . After returning to Germany in 1933 , he joined the <unk> ( <unk> ; Security Service ) , where he was appointed head of the department responsible for Jewish affairs — especially emigration , which the Nazis encouraged through violence and economic pressure . After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 , <unk> and his staff arranged for Jews to be concentrated into ghettos in major cities with the expectation they would be transported farther east or overseas . <unk> drew up plans for a Jewish reservation , first at <unk> in south @-@ east Poland and later in Madagascar , but neither of these plans were ever carried out . 
 After Germany 's defeat in 1945 , <unk> fled to Austria . He lived there until 1950 , when he moved to Argentina using false papers . Information collected by the <unk> , Israel 's intelligence agency , confirmed <unk> 's location in 1960 . A team of <unk> and Shin Bet agents captured <unk> and brought him to Israel to stand trial on 15 criminal charges , including war crimes , crimes against humanity and crimes against the Jewish people . Found guilty on many of these charges , he was sentenced to death by hanging and executed on 1 June 1962 . The trial was widely followed in the media and was later the subject of several books , including Hannah <unk> 's work <unk> in Jerusalem , in which <unk> coined the phrase " the <unk> of evil " to describe <unk> . 
 During this time , he joined the <unk> , the youth section of Hermann <unk> 's right @-@ wing veterans movement , and began reading newspapers published by the Nazi Party ( <unk> ) . The party platform included removal of the <unk> Republic in Germany , rejection of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles , radical <unk> , and anti @-@ <unk> . They promised a strong central government , increased <unk> ( living space ) for <unk> peoples , formation of a national community based on race , and racial cleansing via the active suppression of Jews , who would be stripped of their citizenship and civil rights . 
 A few months after the Nazi seizure of power in Germany in January 1933 , <unk> lost his job due to staffing <unk> at <unk> Oil . The Nazi Party was banned in Austria around the same time . These events were factors in <unk> 's decision to return to Germany . 
 In 1938 , <unk> was posted to Vienna to help organise Jewish emigration from Austria , which had just been integrated into the Reich through the <unk> . Jewish community organisations were placed under supervision of the <unk> and tasked with encouraging and facilitating Jewish emigration . Funding came from money seized from other Jewish people and organisations , as well as donations from overseas , which were placed under <unk> control . <unk> was promoted to SS @-@ <unk> ( first lieutenant ) in July 1938 , and appointed to the Central Agency for Jewish Emigration in Vienna , created in August . By the time he left Vienna in May 1939 , nearly 100 @,@ 000 Jews had left Austria legally , and many more had been smuggled out to Palestine and elsewhere . 
 Jews were concentrated into ghettos in major cities with the expectation that at some point they would be transported further east or even overseas . <unk> conditions in the ghettos — severe overcrowding , poor sanitation , and a lack of food — resulted in a high death rate . On 15 August 1940 , <unk> released a memorandum titled <unk> : <unk> <unk> ( Reich Main Security Office : Madagascar Project ) , calling for the <unk> to Madagascar of a million Jews per year for four years . When Germany failed to defeat the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain , the invasion of Britain was postponed indefinitely . As Britain still controlled the Atlantic and her merchant fleet would not be at Germany 's disposal for use in <unk> , planning for the Madagascar proposal stalled . Hitler continued to mention the Plan until February 1942 , when the idea was permanently <unk> . 
 From the start of the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 , <unk> ( task forces ) followed the army into conquered areas and rounded up and killed Jews , Comintern officials , and ranking members of the Communist Party . <unk> was one of the officials who received regular detailed reports of their activities . On 31 July , <unk> gave <unk> written <unk> to prepare and submit a plan for a " total solution of the Jewish question " in all territories under German control and to co @-@ <unk> the participation of all involved government organisations . The <unk> Ost ( General Plan for the East ) called for <unk> the population of occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to Siberia , for use as slave labour or to be murdered . 
 <unk> stated at his later <unk> that <unk> told him in mid @-@ September that Hitler had ordered that all Jews in German @-@ controlled Europe were to be killed . The initial plan was to implement <unk> Ost after the conquest of the Soviet Union . However , with the entry of the United States into the war in December and the German failure in the Battle of Moscow , Hitler decided that the Jews of Europe were to be <unk> immediately rather than after the war , which now had no end in sight . Around this time , <unk> was promoted to SS @-@ <unk> ( lieutenant colonel ) , the highest rank he achieved . 
 <unk> did not make policy , but acted in an operational capacity . Specific <unk> orders came from <unk> . <unk> 's office was responsible for collecting information on the Jews in each area , organising the seizure of their property , and arranging for and scheduling trains . His department was in constant contact with the Foreign Office , as Jews of conquered nations such as France could not as easily be stripped of their possessions and deported to their deaths . <unk> held regular meetings in his Berlin offices with his department members working in the field and travelled extensively to visit concentration camps and ghettos . His wife , who disliked Berlin , resided in Prague with the children . <unk> initially visited them weekly , but as time went on his visits tapered off to once a month . 
 Germany invaded Hungary on 19 March 1944 . <unk> arrived the same day , and was soon joined by top members of his staff and five or six hundred members of the <unk> , SS , and <unk> ( <unk> ; security police ) . Hitler 's appointment of a Hungarian government more amenable to the Nazis meant that the Hungarian Jews , who had remained essentially unharmed until that point , would now be deported to Auschwitz to serve as forced labour or be <unk> . <unk> toured northeastern Hungary in the last week of April and visited Auschwitz in May to assess the preparations . Round @-@ ups began on 16 April , and from 14 May , four trains of 3 @,@ 000 Jews per day left Hungary and travelled to the camp at Auschwitz II @-@ <unk> , arriving along a newly built spur line that terminated a few hundred metres away from the gas chambers . Only between 10 and 25 per cent of the people on each train were chosen as forced labourers ; the rest were killed within hours of arrival . Under international pressure , the Hungarian government halted <unk> on 6 July 1944 , by which time over <unk> @,@ 000 of Hungary 's 725 @,@ 000 Jews had died . In spite of the orders to stop , <unk> personally made arrangements for additional trains of victims to be sent to Auschwitz on 17 and 19 July . 
 In a series of meetings beginning on 25 April , <unk> met with Joel Brand , a Hungarian Jew and member of the Relief and Rescue Committee ( <unk> ) . <unk> later testified that Berlin had authorised him to allow emigration of a million Jews in exchange for 10 @,@ 000 trucks equipped to handle the <unk> conditions on the Eastern Front . Nothing came of the proposal , as the Western Allies refused to consider the offer . In June 1944 <unk> was involved in negotiations with Rudolf <unk> that resulted in the rescue of 1 @,@ 684 people , who were sent by train to safety in Switzerland in exchange for three <unk> full of <unk> , gold , cash , and <unk> . 
 <unk> , <unk> that Kurt <unk> and others were becoming involved in Jewish emigration matters , and angered by <unk> 's suspension of <unk> to the death camps , requested <unk> in July . At the end of August he was assigned to head a commando squad to assist in the evacuation of 10 @,@ 000 ethnic Germans trapped on the Hungarian border with Romania in the path of the advancing Red Army . The people they were sent to rescue refused to leave , so instead the soldiers helped evacuate members of a German field hospital trapped close to the front . For this <unk> was awarded the Iron Cross , Second Class . Throughout October and November , <unk> arranged for tens of thousands of Jewish victims to travel by forced marches in appalling conditions from Budapest to Vienna , a distance of 210 kilometres ( 130 mi ) . 
 On 24 December 1944 , <unk> fled Budapest just before the Soviets completed their <unk> of the capital . He returned to Berlin , where he arranged for the <unk> records of Department IV @-@ <unk> to be burned . Along with many other SS officers who fled in the closing months of the war , <unk> and his family were living in relative safety in Austria when the war in Europe ended on 8 May 1945 . Historian Richard J. Evans estimates that 5 @.@ 5 to 6 million Jews , representing two @-@ thirds of the Jewish population of Europe , were <unk> by the Nazi regime . 
 At the end of the Second World War , <unk> was captured by the Americans and spent time in several camps for SS officers using forged papers that identified him as " Otto <unk> " . He escaped from a work detail at Cham when he realised that his actual identity had been discovered . He obtained new identity papers with the name of " Otto <unk> " and relocated frequently over the next several months . Moving to the <unk> Heath , he initially got work in the forestry industry and later leased a small plot of land in <unk> , where he lived until 1950 . Meanwhile , at the <unk> trials of major war criminals starting in 1946 , <unk> evidence about <unk> 's activities was given by former commandant of Auschwitz Rudolf <unk> and others . 
 In 1948 <unk> obtained a landing permit for Argentina and false identification under the name of " Ricardo <unk> " through an organisation directed by Bishop <unk> <unk> , an Austrian <unk> then residing in Italy with known Nazi sympathies . These documents enabled him in 1950 to obtain an International Committee of the Red Cross humanitarian passport and the remaining entry permits that would allow emigration to Argentina . He travelled across Europe , staying in a series of monasteries that had been set up as safe houses . <unk> via ship from Genoa on 17 June 1950 , he arrived in Buenos Aires on 14 July . 
 <unk> initially lived in <unk> Province , where he worked for a government contractor . He sent for his family in 1952 , and they moved to Buenos Aires . <unk> held a series of low @-@ paying jobs until finding employment at Mercedes @-@ Benz , where he rose to department head . The family built a house at 14 <unk> Street ( now <unk> <unk> Street ) and moved in during 1960 . 
 For four months beginning in late 1956 , <unk> was extensively interviewed by Nazi expatriate journalist Willem <unk> with the intention of producing a biography . Tapes , transcripts , and handwritten notes by <unk> were produced . The memoirs were later used as the basis for a series of articles that appeared in Life and Der Stern magazines in late 1960 . 
 Several Jews and other survivors of the Holocaust dedicated themselves to finding <unk> and other Nazis . Among them was the Jewish Nazi hunter Simon <unk> . <unk> learned from a letter shown to him in 1953 that <unk> had been seen in Buenos Aires , and he passed along that information to the Israeli <unk> in Vienna in 1954 . When <unk> 's father died in 1960 , <unk> made arrangements for private detectives to <unk> photograph members of the family , as <unk> 's brother Otto was said to bear a strong family resemblance and there were no current photos of the fugitive . He provided these photographs to <unk> agents on 18 February . 
 <unk> was taken to one of several <unk> safe houses that had been set up by the team . He was held there for nine days , during which time his identity was double @-@ checked and confirmed . During these days , <unk> tried to locate <unk> <unk> , the notorious Nazi doctor from Auschwitz concentration camp , as the <unk> had information that he was also living in Buenos Aires . He was hoping to bring <unk> back to Israel on the same flight . <unk> had already left his last known residence in the city , and <unk> was unable to get any leads on where he had gone , so the plans for his capture had to be abandoned . 
 Near midnight on 20 May , <unk> was <unk> by an Israeli doctor on the <unk> team and dressed as a flight attendant . He was smuggled out of Argentina aboard the same El Al Bristol Britannia aircraft that had a few days earlier carried Israel 's delegation to the official 150th anniversary celebration of Argentina 's independence from Spain . After a tense delay at the airport getting the flight plan approved , the plane took off for Israel , stopping over in <unk> , Senegal , to refuel . They arrived in Israel on 22 May , and Ben @-@ Gurion announced <unk> 's capture to the <unk> — Israel 's parliament — the following afternoon . In Argentina , the abduction was met with a violent wave of <unk> carried out by far @-@ right sectors , including the <unk> Nationalist Movement . 
 In June 1960 , after unsuccessful negotiations with Israel , Argentina requested an urgent meeting of the United Nations Security Council to protest , as they regarded the capture as a violation of their sovereign rights . In the ensuing debate , the Israeli representative <unk> <unk> claimed that the <unk> were not Israeli agents but private individuals and so the incident was only an " isolated violation of Argentine law " . On 23 June the Council passed Resolution 138 , which agreed that Argentine sovereignty had been violated and requested that Israel should make <unk> . After further negotiations , on 3 August , Israel and Argentina issued a joint statement admitting the violation of <unk> sovereignty but agreeing to end the dispute . In <unk> 's trial and subsequent appeal , the Israeli court determined that the circumstances of his capture had no bearing on the legality of his trial . 
 Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) documents <unk> in 2006 show that the capture of <unk> caused alarm at the CIA and West German <unk> ( <unk> ) . Both organizations had known for at least two years where <unk> was hiding , but did not act , because it did not serve their interests in the Cold War to do so . Both were concerned about what <unk> might say in his testimony about West German national security advisor Hans <unk> , who had <unk> several antisemitic Nazi laws ( including the <unk> Laws ) . The documents also revealed that both agencies had used some of <unk> 's former Nazi colleagues to spy on European communist countries . 
 The Israeli government arranged for the trial to have prominent media coverage . Capital Cities Broadcasting Corporation of the United States obtained exclusive rights to videotape the proceedings for television broadcast . Many major newspapers from all over the globe sent reporters and published front @-@ page coverage of the story . The trial was held at the Beit Ha <unk> ( today known as the Gerard <unk> Center ) , an auditorium in central Jerusalem . <unk> sat inside a <unk> glass booth to protect him from assassination attempts . The building was modified to allow journalists to watch the trial on closed @-@ circuit television , and 750 seats were available in the auditorium itself . <unk> had the opportunity to watch live television broadcasts of the proceedings , and videotape was flown daily to the United States for broadcast the following day . 
 The prosecution case was presented over the course of 56 days , involving hundreds of documents and 112 witnesses ( many of them Holocaust survivors ) . <unk> 's intention was to not only demonstrate <unk> 's guilt but to present material about the entire Holocaust , thus producing a comprehensive record . <unk> 's opening address began , " It is not an individual that is in the dock at this historic trial and not the Nazi regime alone , but anti @-@ Semitism throughout history . " Defence attorney <unk> repeatedly tried to curb the presentation of material not directly related to <unk> , and was mostly successful . In addition to wartime documents , material presented as evidence included tapes and transcripts from <unk> 's <unk> and <unk> 's interviews in Argentina . In the case of the <unk> interviews , only <unk> 's hand @-@ written notes were admitted into evidence . 
 Some of the evidence submitted by the prosecution took the form of <unk> made by leading Nazis . The defence demanded that the men should be brought to Israel so that the defence 's right to cross @-@ examination would not be <unk> . But <unk> , in his role as Attorney General , declared that he would be obliged to arrest any war criminals who entered Israel . The prosecution proved that <unk> had visited places where <unk> had taken place , including <unk> <unk> camp , Auschwitz , and <unk> ( where he witnessed a mass shooting of Jews ) , and therefore was aware that the <unk> were being killed . 
 When the prosecution rested , the defence opened its case with a motion to dismiss based on the trial itself being illegal . <unk> challenged <unk> 's kidnapping and the basis for the Israeli law under which he had been indicted . He argued that if the trial were to continue , it should transfer its jurisdiction to West Germany . The prosecution countered by stating that the United Nations had endorsed Israel 's actions , and that both West Germany and Argentina had agreed that the charges against him were legitimate . The defence motion was subsequently dismissed . 
 Throughout his cross @-@ examination , prosecutor <unk> attempted to get <unk> to admit he was personally guilty , but no such confession was forthcoming . <unk> admitted to not liking the Jews and viewing them as adversaries , but stated that he never thought their <unk> was justified . When <unk> produced evidence that <unk> had stated in 1945 that " I will leap into my grave laughing because the feeling that I have five million human beings on my conscience is for me a source of extraordinary satisfaction " , <unk> said he meant " enemies of the Reich " such as the Soviets . During later examination by the judges , he admitted he meant the Jews , and said the remark was an accurate reflection of his opinion at the time . 
 <unk> was hanged at a prison in <unk> hours later — the hanging , scheduled for midnight at the end of 31 May , was slightly delayed and thus took place a few minutes into 1 June 1962 . The execution was attended by a small group of officials , four journalists and the Canadian clergyman William Lovell Hull , who had been his spiritual <unk> while in prison . His last words were : 
 Long live Germany . Long live Argentina . Long live Austria . These are the three countries with which I have been most connected and which I will not forget . I <unk> my wife , my family and my friends . I am ready . We 'll meet again soon , as is the fate of all men . I die believing in God . 
 Within hours <unk> 's body had been <unk> , and his ashes scattered in the Mediterranean Sea , outside of Israeli territorial waters by an Israeli Navy patrol boat . 
 The trial and the surrounding media coverage sparked renewed interest in wartime events , and the resulting increase in publication of memoirs and scholarly works helped raise public awareness of the Holocaust . The trial received widespread coverage by the press in West Germany , and many schools added material studying the issues to their curriculum . In Israel , the testimony of witnesses at the trial led to a deeper understanding of the impact of the Holocaust on survivors , especially among younger citizens who had never suffered state @-@ sponsored oppression . 
 <unk> 's youngest son Ricardo says he is not <unk> toward Israel for executing his father . He does not agree that his father 's " following orders " argument <unk> his actions and notes how his father 's lack of remorse caused " difficult emotions " for the <unk> family . Ricardo is now a professor of archaeology at the German Archaeological Institute . 
 In 2015 the filming of the trial by producer Milton <unk> and <unk> TV director Leo <unk> was the subject of the UK television film The <unk> Show , featuring Martin Freeman and Anthony <unk> . The film <unk> dramatic scenes with historical footage from the trial .

 Maryland Route 36 ( also known as MD 36 or Route 36 ) is a 29 @.@ 43 @-@ mile ( 47 @.@ 36 km ) state highway located in <unk> County , Maryland , United States . MD 36 's southern terminus is at the <unk> 46 bridge in <unk> and its northern terminus at U.S. Route 40 <unk> near <unk> . Between <unk> and <unk> , it is known as Georges Creek Road , and from <unk> to <unk> it is known as Mount Savage Road . Like the majority of Maryland state highways , MD 36 is maintained by the Maryland State Highway Administration ( <unk> ) . 
 MD 36 serves as the main road through the Georges Creek Valley , a region which is historically known for coal mining , and has been designated by <unk> as part of the Coal Heritage Scenic Byway . MD 36 is the main road connecting the towns of <unk> , <unk> , and Midland in southwestern <unk> County , as well as <unk> , Mount Savage , and <unk> in northwestern <unk> County . 
 As the road enters <unk> , it <unk> and the speed limit drops to 25 mph ( 40 km / h ) , increasing to 35 mph ( 56 km / h ) after it travels through <unk> . MD 36 passes through <unk> as Main Street , and it intersects MD <unk> near the center of <unk> . Along Main Street in <unk> is the <unk> Iron <unk> , a historic blast <unk> which operated in the early 19th century . 
 MD 36 then continues toward Midland . At Midland , there is a sharp curve in the road , and the speed limit drops to 25 mph ( 40 km / h ) . Along this curve , MD 36 intersects Church Street , which connects to MD <unk> , the old alignment of MD 36 between Midland and <unk> . The new alignment of MD 36 proceeds northeast , passing near Vale Summit , where it intersects MD 55 . 
 North of the MD 55 intersection , MD 36 meets Interstate 68 at a diamond interchange at exit 34 . Near this interchange is God 's Ark of Safety , a church famous for its attempt to build a replica of <unk> 's Ark . Between Midland and <unk> , the speed limit is again 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) , and there is a short section near the Interstate 68 interchange where MD 36 expands to four lanes . Upon entering <unk> , MD 36 joins U.S. Route 40 <unk> as Main Street . MD 36 follows Main Street westward through <unk> , meeting the northern terminus of MD <unk> at Grant Street . At Depot Street , near the center of <unk> , MD 36 connects to the western depot of the Western Maryland Scenic Railroad . At the intersection with Water Street , MD 36 leaves U.S. Route 40 <unk> , and upon leaving <unk> city limits its name changes to Mount Savage Road . 
 After leaving <unk> , MD 36 is known as Mount Savage Road , as it travels eastward , perpendicular to its signed direction , toward Mount Savage . North of <unk> <unk> , MD 36 meets MD <unk> , which connects MD 36 to U.S. Route 40 <unk> in <unk> <unk> . The road between <unk> and Mount Savage is particularly <unk> , and includes several hairpin turns near <unk> . The speed limit on this section of the road is 35 mph ( 56 km / h ) . 
 As the road enters Mount Savage , it passes by the Mount Savage Castle , a Scottish @-@ style castle built in 1840 , which currently operates as a bed @-@ and @-@ breakfast . In Mount Savage , the route <unk> as it follows Main Street , and the road is frequently <unk> by parked cars , making it difficult for two cars to pass by each other . East of Mount Savage , the route <unk> and its speed limit gradually increases to 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) . 
 In <unk> , MD 36 intersects MD 47 , which connects it with PA 160 in Somerset County . From its intersection with MD 47 to its terminus at <unk> , MD 36 follows newer <unk> , with the old <unk> being designated MD <unk> . At <unk> , MD 36 intersects MD 35 , which connects it with PA 96 in Bedford County . MD 36 ends at U.S. Route 40 <unk> at the <unk> near <unk> . 
 MD 36 passes through the Georges Creek Valley , which has a long history of coal mining . In recognition of this , the <unk> has designated MD 36 as part of the Coal Heritage Scenic Byway . Coal mining was a major industry in western Maryland in the 19th century , with railroads being the major route connecting the coal mines to markets outside the Georges Creek Valley . Deep mining , which was the primary mining method used in western Maryland , declined in use after World War II , replaced primarily by surface mining . Although Maryland coal production is now only a small fraction of total U.S. coal production , coal from the Georges Creek Valley is used to power the <unk> Warrior Run power plant in <unk> . 
 MD 36 was assigned a route number before 1927 , earlier than most of the other Maryland state highways . The original alignment of MD 36 in southern <unk> County closely paralleled the Georges Creek Railroad . Later <unk> have shifted MD 36 away from the railroad in several locations , but three <unk> remain : one north of <unk> , one south of <unk> near the MD <unk> intersection , and a third crossing near <unk> . 
 Over the years , multiple new <unk> of MD 36 have been built for various reasons , such as to smooth out curves in the road . Several of the old <unk> have been assigned route numbers of their own . The southernmost of these is MD <unk> , which consists of the old alignment through <unk> . Prior to the construction of the bridge connecting MD 36 to <unk> 46 , MD <unk> was the alignment of MD 36 through <unk> , ending at MD 135 . In Barton , MD <unk> carries the old alignment of MD 36 . The longest of the old alignment sections is MD <unk> , which runs from Midland to <unk> , and was bypassed in the 1970s with a new alignment of MD 36 following part of MD 55 and connecting to Interstate 68 . Prior to this change , MD 55 ended in Midland ; it has since been truncated to its current terminus at Vale Summit . 
 Who <unk> to Be a <unk> ( often informally called <unk> ) is an American television game show based on the same @-@ titled British program and developed for the United States by Michael Davies . The show features a quiz competition in which contestants attempt to win a top prize of U.S. $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 by answering a series of multiple @-@ choice questions of increasing difficulty ( although , for a time , most of the questions were of random difficulty ) . The program has endured as one of the longest @-@ running and most successful international variants in the Who <unk> to Be a <unk> ? franchise . 
 The original U.S. version aired on ABC from August 16 , 1999 to June 27 , 2002 , and was hosted by <unk> <unk> . The daily syndicated version of the show began airing on September 16 , 2002 , and was hosted for eleven seasons by Meredith <unk> until May 31 , 2013 . Later hosts included Cedric the Entertainer in the 2013 – 14 season , Terry Crews in the following season ( 2014 – 15 ) , and Chris Harrison , who began hosting on September 14 , 2015 . 
 As the first U.S. network game show to offer a million @-@ dollar top prize , the show made television history by becoming one of the highest @-@ rated game shows in the history of American television . The U.S. <unk> has won seven <unk> Emmy Awards , and TV Guide ranked it # 6 in its 2013 list of the 60 greatest game shows of all time . 
 At its core , the game is a quiz competition in which the goal is to correctly answer a series of fourteen ( originally fifteen ) consecutive multiple @-@ choice questions . The questions are of increasing difficulty , except in the 2010 – 15 format overhaul , where the contestants were faced with fourteen questions of random difficulty , distributed into two rounds . Each question is worth a specified amount of money ; the amounts are cumulative in the first round , but not in the second . If the contestant gives a wrong answer to any question , their game is over and their <unk> are reduced to $ 1 @,@ 000 for tier @-@ one questions , $ 5 @,@ 000 for tier @-@ two questions , and $ 50 @,@ 000 for tier @-@ three questions . However , the contestant has the option of " walking away " without giving an answer after being presented with a question , in which case the game ends and the contestant is guaranteed to walk away with all the money they have previously received . With the exception of the <unk> format , upon correctly answering questions five and ten , contestants are guaranteed at least the amount of prize money associated with that level . If the contestant gives an incorrect answer , their <unk> drop down to the last milestone achieved . Since 2015 , if the contestant answers a question incorrectly before reaching question five , he or she leaves with $ 1 @,@ 000 . Prior to the <unk> format , a contestant left with nothing if he or she answered a question incorrectly before reaching the first milestone . In the <unk> format era , contestants who incorrectly answered a question had their <unk> reduced to $ 1 @,@ 000 in round one and $ 25 @,@ 000 in round two . 
 On the ABC versions , ten contestants competed in a preliminary " <unk> Finger " round for the right to play the main game on each episode . The contestants were presented with a question and a list of four answers which needed to be put in a specific order . Using keys on their <unk> , each of the contestants attempted to enter the correct order in the shortest amount of time , with a maximum time limit of 20 seconds . If the main game ended and there was still time available for another game , the remaining contestants played another <unk> Finger round for a chance to play the main game . In the event of a tie between two or more contestants , those contestants played an additional <unk> Finger question to break the tie . If all contestants answered the question incorrectly , the round was repeated with another question . <unk> Finger was eliminated from the gameplay when the syndicated version premiered in 2002 . 
 From 2008 to 2010 , time limits were used for each question . <unk> were given up to 15 seconds each for questions one through five , 30 seconds each for questions six through ten , and 45 seconds each for questions eleven through fourteen . <unk> time was banked , and if the contestant reached question fifteen , he or she was given 45 seconds plus however much time that was previously banked . If the clock reached zero before a contestant could provide a final answer , the contestant was forced to walk away with the <unk> they had at that point . During the clock format era , a " <unk> Menu " was introduced , in which categories are revealed for each question at the beginning of the game , and are made visible to the contestant for their future reference . Some prize levels also changed at the start of season eight . Most of the episodes in season eight ( from the " Million Dollar Tournament of Ten " onward ) featured special " Celebrity <unk> " that were mid @-@ level in monetary value , and were provided by notable individuals whose identities were not revealed until the contestant reached their special questions . 
 When the ninth syndicated season began on September 13 , 2010 , the format was overhauled . Ten questions were asked in round one , each assigned one of ten different money amounts which were randomized at the beginning of the game ; in this case , the difficulty of the questions was not tied to the dollar value . The dollar values for each question remained hidden until a contestant either provided a correct answer or chose to " jump " the question . The value of each question answered correctly was added to the contestant 's bank , for a maximum total of $ 68 @,@ 600 . A contestant who completed the round successfully could walk at any subsequent point with all the money in their bank , or could walk without completing the round with half that amount ( e.g. , a contestant who banked $ 30 @,@ 000 would leave with $ 15 @,@ 000 ) . After completing round one , the contestant moved on to a second round of gameplay ( the " Classic <unk> " round ) , in which four non @-@ categorized questions were played for set non @-@ cumulative values and a correct answer augmented the contestant 's <unk> to that point , as in the older formats . The <unk> format changes , including the <unk> and double @-@ round distribution of questions , were reverted for the fourteenth syndicated season . 
 From 2011 to 2014 , certain weeks of the show were designated as " Double Your Money " weeks . In those , a certain question in round one was designated the " Double Money Question . " When a contestant answered such a question correctly , the monetary value behind the question was doubled and added to his or her bank , giving him or her the possibility of adding up to a maximum of $ 50 @,@ 000 to his or her bank on a single question ; under these special rules , it was possible for a contestant to finish round one with a maximum total of $ 93 @,@ 600 in their bank . However , when a contestant " jumped " the question , they forfeited the doubled money . 
 In the event that a contestant leaves and very little time remains , a randomly selected audience member is given one chance to win $ 1 @,@ 000 by answering the next question intended for the previous contestant ( or $ 2 @,@ 000 if the next question was on a Double Money episode ) . Regardless of the outcome , the audience member receives a special prize . In seasons nine and ten , the prize was a copy of the <unk> video game ; as of season eleven , audience members now receive 20 free <unk> for a Facebook game based on the show 's format . In season thirteen , which gave this game the name " <unk> " , the question the audience player faced did not come from the previous player 's stack , but was instead a separate question . Season thirteen also introduced two additional audience games : " Team <unk> " , where two audience members are both presented with a single question and lock in their individual answers separately for the chance to win $ 500 and a bonus question with which they can double their money ; and " <unk> Feet " , a variation of <unk> Finger which four audience members play for the chance to split $ 1 @,@ 000 . 
 For the first five years of the U.S. <unk> 's existence , the <unk> structure was as follows : first going from $ 100 to $ 300 in <unk> of $ 100 , then from $ 500 to $ 64 @,@ 000 with the dollar value for each new question being double that of the one before it , and finally from $ 125 @,@ 000 to $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 with the dollar values doubling for each new question . At the start of the third syndicated season the values for questions ten through twelve were changed from $ 32 @,@ 000 , $ 64 @,@ 000 , and $ 125 @,@ 000 to $ 25 @,@ 000 , $ 50 @,@ 000 , and $ 100 @,@ 000 respectively . The 2004 <unk> structure endured until the eighth syndicated season , when after the ninth contestant from the 2009 <unk> revival played , a new <unk> structure was implemented in which the dollar values first went from $ 500 to $ 2 @,@ 000 with the dollar value of each new question being double that of the previous one , then to $ 3 @,@ 000 , then from $ 5 @,@ 000 to $ 15 @,@ 000 in <unk> of $ 2 @,@ 500 ; the dollar values of questions ten through fifteen remained unchanged . In the <unk> format era , the ten questions in round one had random values which included $ 100 , $ 500 , $ 1 @,@ 000 , $ 2 @,@ 000 , $ 3 @,@ 000 , $ 5 @,@ 000 , $ 7 @,@ 000 , $ 10 @,@ 000 , $ 15 @,@ 000 , and $ 25 @,@ 000 ; the final four questions , in round two , retained their 2004 values . For the 2015 – 16 season , the first five questions follow the <unk> structure used from 2009 to 2010 , while the dollar value of each new question for the next five questions is $ 7 @,@ 000 , $ 10 @,@ 000 , $ 20 @,@ 000 , $ 30 @,@ 000 and $ 50 @,@ 000 ; the money values for the last four questions remain unchanged . The second safe haven is $ 50 @,@ 000 at question 10 , with the first one still $ 5 @,@ 000 . 
 The $ 500 @,@ 000 and $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 prizes were initially <unk> @-@ sum payments , but were changed to <unk> in September 2002 when the series moved to syndication . <unk> winning either of these prizes receive $ 250 @,@ 000 thirty days after their show broadcasts and the remainder paid in equal annual payments . The $ 500 @,@ 000 prize consists of $ 25 @,@ 000 per year for 10 years , while the $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 prize consists of $ 37 @,@ 500 per year for 20 years . 
 <unk> are given a series of <unk> to aid them with difficult questions . They can use as many <unk> as desired per question , but each <unk> can only be used once per game . Three <unk> are available from the start of the game . Depending on the format of the show , additional <unk> may become available after the contestant correctly answers the fifth or tenth question . In the clock format , usage of <unk> temporarily paused the clock while the <unk> were played . 
 The first contestant to correctly answer all 15 questions and win the top prize of $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 was John Carpenter , on the episode aired November 19 , 1999 . In 2000 , the million dollar top prize was awarded five times : to Dan <unk> on the episode aired January 18 , to Joe <unk> on March 23 , to Bob House on June 13 , to Kim Hunt on July 6 , and to David Goodman on July 11 . 
 In January 2001 , when no contestant had won $ 1 million in any show that aired over a period of five months , the top prize was then changed from a flat $ 1 million to an accumulating <unk> that increased by $ 10 @,@ 000 for each episode where the top prize was not won . On April 10 , 2001 , Kevin <unk> correctly answered the final question and won $ 2 @,@ 180 @,@ 000 , making him the biggest winner in television history at the time . The top prize for correctly answering the final question returned to $ 1 million following <unk> 's win and has remained unchanged since ; just five days after <unk> 's win , the standard $ 1 million prize was awarded to Bernie Cullen . The last top prize winner on the original network version was Ed <unk> , on the episode aired September 7 , 2001 ; he had previously appeared on the episode aired January 31 , 2001 , where he was ruled to have answered his $ 16 @,@ 000 question incorrectly , but when it was discovered that there was a mistake in that question , <unk> was invited back and won a $ 1 @.@ 86 million <unk> . On the Super <unk> spin @-@ off , Robert <unk> won $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 after answering the twelfth question and then walked away , not reaching the final question for $ 10 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 . 
 On the syndicated version 's first season , two contestants correctly answered all 15 questions and won the top prize of $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 : Kevin Smith on February 18 , 2003 , and Nancy Christy on May 8 of the same year . During the Million Dollar Tournament of Ten which aired in November 2009 , Sam Murray , who had previously supplied correct responses for eleven questions , risked his <unk> on a special $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 question ; he was the only contestant to answer his question correctly . 
 The original network version of the U.S. <unk> and the subsequent <unk> <unk> were hosted by <unk> <unk> . When the syndicated version was being developed , the production team felt that it was not feasible for <unk> to continue hosting , as the show recorded four episodes in a single day , and that the team was looking for qualities in a new host : it had to be somebody who would love the contestants and be willing to root for them . <unk> O 'Donnell was initially offered a hosting position on this new edition , but declined the opportunity almost immediately . Eventually Meredith <unk> , who had previously competed in a celebrity charity event on the original network version , was named host of the new syndicated edition . 
 ABC originally offered <unk> hosting duties on the syndicated <unk> to <unk> one of her re @-@ negotiations for the network 's daytime talk show The View , which she was <unk> at the time . When the show was honored by <unk> on its <unk> Hall of Fame special , <unk> herself further explained her motivation for hosting the syndicated version as follows : 
 I did the show because I fell in love with the show , and really , first and foremost , as a parent , [ I feel that ] there aren 't that many shows on television that you can watch as a family . And when Michael Davies approached me and said , " Would you be interested in hosting the syndicated version ? " , I said , " Just point me toward the contract ! I am so there ! " 
 From 2007 to 2011 , when <unk> was concurrently working as a co @-@ host of Today , guest hosts appeared in the second half of each season of the syndicated version . Guest hosts who filled in for <unk> included <unk> , Al <unk> , Tom <unk> , Tim Vincent , Dave Price , Billy Bush , <unk> Gibbons , Cat <unk> , Samantha Harris , Shaun Robinson , Steve Harvey , John Henson , <unk> Shepherd , Tim <unk> , and D. L. <unk> . 
 On January 10 , 2013 , <unk> announced that after eleven seasons with the syndicated <unk> , she would be leaving the show as part of an effort to focus on other projects in her career . She finalized taping of her last episodes with the show in November 2012 . Her successor as host of the syndicated <unk> , Cedric the Entertainer , was introduced to the show when season twelve premiered on September 2 , 2013 . On April 30 , 2014 , <unk> announced that Cedric had decided to leave the show in order to lighten his workload , resulting in him being succeeded by Terry Crews for the 2014 – 2015 season . Crews was succeeded by Chris Harrison , host of The Bachelor and its spin @-@ offs , when season 14 premiered on September 14 , 2015 . 
 The original executive producers of the U.S. <unk> were British television producers Michael Davies and Paul Smith , the latter of whom undertook the responsibility of licensing <unk> to American <unk> as part of his effort to transform the UK program into a global franchise . Smith served until 2007 and Davies until 2010 ; additionally , Leigh Hampton ( previously co @-@ executive producer in the later days of the network version and in the syndicated version 's first two seasons ) served as an executive producer from 2004 to 2010 . Rich <unk> , who was previously a supervising producer , became the executive producer in 2010 and held that position until 2014 , when he left <unk> to hold the same position with <unk> 's newly launched syndicated talk show , and was replaced by James Rowley . Vincent <unk> , who had previously been the syndicated <unk> 's supervising producer for its first two seasons , served as that version 's co @-@ executive producer for the 2004 – 05 season , after which he was succeeded by <unk> herself , who continued to hold the title until her departure in 2013 ( sharing her position with <unk> for the 2009 – 10 season ) . 
 The original network version of <unk> was directed by Mark <unk> , who later served as the syndicated version 's consulting producer for its first two seasons , and then as the director of <unk> , which ran on ABC from December 2007 to July 2008 . The syndicated version was directed by Matthew Cohen from 2002 to 2010 , by Rob George from 2010 to 2013 , and by Brian <unk> in the 2013 – 14 season . Former Price Is Right director Rich <unk> became <unk> 's director in 2014 . 
 The U.S. version of <unk> is a co @-@ production of <unk> , a division of Sony Pictures Entertainment , and <unk> Productions , a division of The Walt Disney Company . <unk> purchased <unk> 's original production company <unk> in 2008 , while <unk> has produced the series since its beginning , and holds the copyright on all U.S. <unk> episodes to date . The show is distributed by <unk> 's corporate sibling Disney – ABC Domestic Television ( previously known as Buena Vista Television ) . 
 The U.S. <unk> was taped at ABC 's Television Center East studio on the Upper West Side of Manhattan in New York from 1999 to 2012 . <unk> were moved to <unk> Broadcasting 's Metropolis Studios in East Harlem in 2013 , and production moved to studios located in Stamford , Connecticut the following year . Episodes of the syndicated version are produced from June to December . The show originally taped four episodes in a single day , but that number has since been changed to five . 
 When the U.S. version of <unk> was first conceived in 1998 , Michael Davies was a young television producer who was serving as the head of ABC 's little @-@ noticed reality programming division ( at a time when reality television had not yet become a phenomenon in America ) . At that time , ABC was lingering in third place in the ratings <unk> among U.S. broadcast networks , and was on the verge of losing its status as one of the " Big Three " networks . Meanwhile , the popularity of game shows was at an all @-@ time nadir , as with the exception of The Price Is Right , the genre was absent from networks ' daytime <unk> at that point . Having earlier created <unk> for Lifetime Television and participated with Al Burton and Donnie <unk> in the creation of <unk> Ben Stein 's Money for Comedy Central , Davies decided to create a <unk> game show that would save the network from collapse and revive interest in game shows . 
 Davies originally considered reviving CBS 's long @-@ lost quiz show The $ 64 @,@ 000 Question for a new era , with a new home on ABC . However , this effort 's development was limited as when the producer heard that the British <unk> was about to make its debut , he got his friends and family members in the UK to record the show , and subsequently ended up receiving about eight <unk> packages from different family members , each containing a copy of <unk> 's first episode . Davies was so <unk> by everything that he had seen and heard , from host Chris <unk> 's intimate involvement with the contestant to the show 's lighting system and music tracks , that he chose to abandon his work on the $ 64 @,@ 000 Question revival in favor of introducing <unk> to American <unk> , convinced that it would become extraordinarily popular . 
 With few exceptions , any legal resident of the United States who is 18 years of age or older has the potential of becoming a contestant through <unk> 's audition process . Those ineligible include employees , immediate family or household members , and close acquaintances of <unk> , Disney , or any of their respective affiliates or <unk> ; television stations that broadcast the syndicated version ; or any advertising agency or other firm or entity engaged in the production , administration , or <unk> of the show . Also ineligible are current candidates for political office and individuals who have appeared on a different game show outside of cable that has been broadcast within the past year , is intended to be broadcast within the next year , or played the main game on any of the U.S. versions of <unk> itself . 
 Potential contestants of the original <unk> version had to compete in a telephone contest which had them <unk> a toll @-@ free number and answer three questions by putting objects or events in order . <unk> had ten seconds to enter the order on a <unk> , with any incorrect answer ending the game / call . The 10 @,@ 000 to 20 @,@ 000 candidates who answered all three questions correctly were selected into a random drawing in which approximately 300 contestants competed for ten spots on the show using the same phone quiz method . <unk> for contestants outside the New York City area included round trip <unk> ( or other transportation ) and hotel accommodations . 
 The syndicated version 's potential contestants , depending on <unk> , are required to pass an electronically scored test comprising a set of thirty questions which must be answered within a 10 @-@ minute time limit . <unk> who fail the test are eliminated , while those who pass are interviewed for an audition by the production staff , and those who impress the staff the most are then notified by postal mail that they have been placed into a pool for possible selection as contestants . At the producers ' discretion , contestants from said pool are selected to appear on actual episodes of the syndicated program ; these contestants are given a phone call from staff and asked to confirm the information on their initial application form and verify that they meet all eligibility requirements . Afterwards , they are given a date to travel to the show 's taping facilities to participate in a scheduled episode of the show . Unlike its ABC counterpart , the syndicated version does not offer transportation or hotel accommodations to contestants at the production company 's expense ; that version 's contestants are instead required to provide transportation and accommodations of their own . 
 The syndicated <unk> also conducts open casting calls in various locations across the United States to search for potential contestants . These are held in late spring or early summer , with all dates and locations posted on the show 's official website . The producers make no guarantee on how many applicants will be tested at each particular venue ; however , the show will not test any more than 2 @,@ 500 individuals per audition day . 
 In cases when the show features themed episodes with two people playing as a team , auditions for these episodes ' contestants are announced on the show 's website . Both members of the team must pass the written test and the audition interview successfully in order to be considered for selection . If only one member of the team passes , he or she is placed into the contestant pool alone and must continue the audition process as an individual in order to proceed . 
 The original <unk> musical score holds the distinction of being the only game show soundtrack to be acknowledged by the American Society of Composers , Authors and Publishers , as the <unk> were honored with numerous ASCAP awards for their work , the earliest of them awarded in 2000 . The original music <unk> were given minor <unk> for the clock format in 2008 ; for example , the question <unk> were <unk> to the " ticking " sounds of the game clock . Even later , the Strachan score was removed from the U.S. version altogether for the introduction of the <unk> format in 2010 , in favor of a new musical score with <unk> written by Jeff <unk> and Mark T. Williams , co @-@ founders of the Los Angeles @-@ based company <unk> Music . 
 The U.S. <unk> 's basic set is a direct adaptation of the British version 's set design , which was conceived by Andy <unk> . Paul Smith 's original licensing agreement for the U.S. <unk> required that the show 's set design , along with all other elements of the show 's on @-@ air presentation ( musical score , lighting system , host 's wardrobe , etc . ) , <unk> faithfully to the way in which they were presented in the British version ; this same licensing agreement applied to all other international versions of the show , making <unk> 's <unk> set design the most reproduced scenic design in television history . The original version of the U.S. <unk> 's set cost $ 200 @,@ 000 to construct . The U.S. <unk> 's production design is handled by George Allison , whose predecessors have included David <unk> and Jim <unk> . 
 Unlike older game shows whose sets are or were designed to make the contestant ( s ) feel at ease , <unk> 's set was designed to make the contestant feel uncomfortable , so that the program feels more like a movie thriller than a typical quiz show . The floor is made of <unk> beneath which lies a huge dish covered in mirror paper . Before the <unk> format was implemented in 2010 , the main game had the contestant and host sit in chairs in the center of the stage , known as " Hot <unk> " ; these measured 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) high , were modeled after chairs typically found in hair salons , and each seat featured a computer monitor directly facing it to display questions and other <unk> information . Shortly after the <unk> format was introduced to <unk> , <unk> stated in an interview with her <unk> predecessor on his morning talk show that the Hot <unk> was removed because it was decided that the seat , which was originally intended to make the contestant feel nervous , actually ended up having contestants feel so comfortable in it that it did not service the production team any longer . 
 The lighting system is programmed to <unk> the set as the contestant progresses further into the game . There are also <unk> situated at the bottom of the set area that <unk> down on the contestant when they answer a major question ; to increase the visibility of the light beams emitted by such <unk> , oil is <unk> , creating a haze effect . Media scholar Dr. Robert Thompson , a professor at Syracuse University , stated that the show 's lighting system made the contestant feel as though they were outside of prison when an escape was in progress . 
 When the <unk> format was introduced , the Hot <unk> and corresponding monitors were replaced with a single podium , and as a result , the contestant and host stand throughout the game and are also able to walk around the stage . Also , two video screens were installed – one that displays the current question in play , and another that displays the contestant 's cumulative total and progress during the game . In September 2012 , the redesigned set was improved with a modernized look and feel , in order to take into account the show 's transition to high @-@ definition broadcasting , which had just come about the previous year . The two video screens were replaced with two larger ones , having twice as many <unk> as the previous screens had ; the previous contestant podium was replaced with a new one ; and light @-@ emitting <unk> ( LED ) technology was integrated into the lighting system to give the lights more vivid colors and the set and gameplay experience a more intimate feel . 
 The U.S. version of <unk> was launched by ABC as a half @-@ hour <unk> program on August 16 , 1999 . When it premiered , it became the first U.S. network game show to offer a million @-@ dollar top prize to contestants . After airing thirteen episodes and reaching an audience of 15 million viewers by the end of the show 's first week on the air , the program expanded to an hour @-@ long format when it returned in November . The series , of which episodes were originally shown only a day after their initial taping , was promoted to regular status on January 18 , 2000 and , at the height of its popularity , was airing on ABC five nights a week . The show was so popular during its original <unk> run that rival networks created or re @-@ <unk> game shows of their own ( e.g. , <unk> , Twenty One , etc . ) , as well as <unk> various game shows of British and Australian origin to America ( such as Winning Lines , <unk> Link , and It 's Your Chance of a Lifetime ) . 
 The nighttime version initially drew in up to 30 million viewers a day three times a week , an unheard @-@ of number in modern network television . In the 1999 – 2000 season , it averaged # 1 in the ratings against all other television shows , with 28 @,@ <unk> @,@ 000 viewers . In the next season ( 2000 – 01 ) , three nights out of the five weekly episodes placed in the top 10 . However , the show 's ratings began to fall during the 2000 – 01 season , so that at the start of the 2001 – 02 season , the ratings were only a fraction of what they had been one year before , and by season 's end , the show was no longer even ranked among the top 20 . ABC 's reliance on the show 's popularity led the network to fall quickly from its former spot as the nation 's most watched network . 
 As ABC 's <unk> of the <unk> <unk> led the public to tire of the show , there was speculation that the show would not survive beyond the 2001 – 02 season . The staff planned on switching it to a format that would emphasize comedy more than the game and feature a host other than <unk> , but in the end , the <unk> show was canceled , with its final episode airing on June 27 , 2002 . 
 In 2001 , <unk> producers began work on a half @-@ hour daily syndicated version of the show , with the idea being that it would serve as an accompaniment to the network series which was still in production . ABC 's cancellation of the network <unk> ended that idea ; however , the syndicated <unk> still had enough interest to be <unk> and <unk> sold the series to local stations for the 2002 – 03 season . The syndicated series nearly met the same fate as its predecessor , however , due in part to worries that stemmed from a decision made by one of its affiliates . 
 At mid @-@ season , <unk> announced that for the 2003 – 04 season it had acquired the broadcast rights to The People 's Court after <unk> , which had been airing the revived series since its 1997 debut , dropped it from its lineup . <unk> announced plans to move The People 's Court into the time slot that was occupied by <unk> and the still @-@ airing 4 : 30 pm local <unk> once it joined the station 's lineup in September 2003 . This led to speculation that the syndicated <unk> would not be returning for a second season , and <unk> 's concerns over losing its New York affiliate were compounded by the fact that there were not many time slots available for the show in New York outside of the undesirable late @-@ night slots that <unk> try to avoid . 
 According to e @-@ <unk> released in the Sony Pictures Entertainment hack , <unk> narrowly avoided cancellation after the 2014 – 15 season . The show 's declining ratings prompted <unk> to demand a dramatically reduced licensing fee for renewal , which <unk> was hesitant to accept . The series was nonetheless renewed for the 2015 – 16 season , with various cuts to the show 's production budget and a return to the original format ( but with only 14 questions ) . Had the show not been renewed , <unk> would have placed the show on extended hiatus for three years , reclaimed full rights to the show ( without the innovations and format added in the syndicated run , to which <unk> owns intellectual property rights ) , and <unk> the revived show to another network or <unk> . 
 <unk> acquired the <unk> rights to the U.S. <unk> in August 2003 . The network initially aired only episodes from the three seasons of the original prime @-@ time run ; however , additional episodes were later added . These included the Super <unk> spin @-@ off , which aired on <unk> from May 2005 to January 2007 , and the first two seasons of the syndicated version , which began airing on November 10 , 2008 . 
 Various special editions and tournaments have been conducted which feature celebrities playing the game and <unk> <unk> to charities of their choice . During celebrity editions on the original ABC version , contestants were allowed to receive help from their fellow contestants during the first ten questions . The most successful celebrity contestants throughout the show 's run have included Drew Carey , <unk> O 'Donnell , <unk> MacDonald , and <unk> <unk> , all of whom won $ 500 @,@ 000 for their respective charities . The episode featuring O 'Donnell 's $ 500 @,@ 000 win averaged 36 @.@ 1 million viewers , the highest number for a single episode of the show . 
 There have also been special weeks featuring two or three family members or couples competing as a team , a " Champions Edition " where former big winners returned and split their <unk> with their favorite charities , a " Zero Dollar <unk> Edition " featuring contestants who previously missed one of the first @-@ tier questions and left with nothing , and a " Tax @-@ Free Edition " in which H & R Block calculated the taxes of <unk> to allow contestants to earn stated <unk> after taxes , and various theme weeks featuring college students , teachers , <unk> @-@ to @-@ be , <unk> as contestants . Additionally , the syndicated version once featured an annual " Walk In & <unk> Week " with contestants who were randomly selected from the audience without having to take the audition test . 
 Special weeks have also included shows featuring questions concerning specific topics , such as professional football , celebrity gossip , movies , and pop culture . During a week of episodes in November 2007 , to celebrate the 1,000th episode of the syndicated <unk> , all contestants that week started with $ 1 @,@ 000 so that they could not leave empty @-@ handed , and only had to answer ten questions to win $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 . During that week , twenty home viewers per day also won $ 1 @,@ 000 each . 
 In 2004 , <unk> returned to host 12 episodes of a spin @-@ off program titled Who <unk> to Be a Super <unk> in which contestants could potentially win $ 10 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 . ABC aired five episodes of this spin @-@ off during the week of February 22 , 2004 , and an additional seven episodes later that year in May . As usual , the contestants were to answer a series of 15 multiple choice questions of increasing difficulty , but the dollar values were substantially increased . The <unk> structure of Super <unk> was as follows : first going from $ 1 @,@ 000 to $ 5 @,@ 000 in <unk> of $ 1 @,@ 000 ; then from $ 10 @,@ 000 to $ 30 @,@ 000 in <unk> of $ 10 @,@ 000 ; then to $ 50 @,@ 000 , $ 100 @,@ 000 , $ 500 @,@ 000 , and $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 ; and finally from $ 2 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 to $ 10 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 with the dollar value doubling for each new question . 
 To celebrate the tenth anniversary of <unk> 's U.S. debut , the show returned to ABC <unk> for an eleven @-@ night event hosted by <unk> , which aired August 9 – 23 , 2009 . The Academy Award @-@ winning movie <unk> <unk> and the 2008 economic crisis helped boost interest of renewal of the game show . 
 The episodes featured game play based on the previous rule set of the syndicated version ( including the rule changes implemented in season seven ) but used the <unk> Finger round to select contestants . Various celebrities also made special guest appearances at the end of every episode ; each guest played one question for a chance at $ 50 @,@ 000 for a charity of their choice , being allowed to use any one of the four <unk> in place at the time ( <unk> @-@ a @-@ Friend , <unk> the <unk> , Double <unk> , and <unk> the Expert ) , but still earned a minimum of $ 25 @,@ 000 for the charity if they answered the question incorrectly . 
 Although the syndicated <unk> had produced two <unk> in its first season , Nancy Christy 's May 2003 win was still standing as the most recent when the program began its eighth season in fall of 2009 . <unk> that six @-@ plus years had been too long since someone had won the top prize , producers conducted a tournament to find a third million dollar winner . For the first nine weeks of the 2009 – 10 season , each episode saw contestants attempt to qualify for what was referred to as the " Tournament of Ten " . <unk> were <unk> based on how much money they had won , with the biggest winner ranked first and the lowest ranked tenth . Ties were broken based on how much time a contestant had banked when they had walked away from the game . 
 The tournament began on the episode aired November 9 , 2009 , and playing in order from the lowest to the highest seed , tournament contestants played one at a time at the end of that episode and the next nine . The rules were exactly the same as they were for a normal million dollar question under the clock format introduced the season before , except here , the contestants had no <unk> at their disposal . Each contestant received a base time of 45 seconds . For each question they had answered before walking away , the contestants received any unused seconds that were left when they gave their answers . The accumulated total of those unused seconds was then added to the base time to give the contestants their final question time limit . 
 Each contestant had the same decision facing them as before , which was whether to attempt to answer the question or walk away with their pre @-@ tournament total intact . Attempting the question and answering incorrectly incurred the same penalty as in regular play , with a reduction of their pre @-@ tournament <unk> to $ 25 @,@ 000 . If the question was answered correctly , the player that did so became the tournament leader . If another player after him / her answered correctly , that player assumed the lead and the previous leader kept their pre @-@ tournament <unk> . The highest remaining seed to have attempted and correctly answered their question at the end of the tournament on November 20 , 2009 would be declared the winner and become the syndicated series ' third millionaire . 
 The first contestant to attempt to answer the million dollar question was Sam Murray , the tournament 's eighth @-@ <unk> <unk> . On November 11 , Murray was asked approximately how many people had lived on Earth in its history and correctly guessed 100 billion . Murray was still atop the <unk> entering the November 20 finale as he remained the only contestant to even attempt to answer his or her question . The only person who could defeat him was top seed and $ 250 @,@ 000 winner <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> , who was asked a question regarding the <unk> , cited as " a rare example of a word that rhymes with orange " . <unk> @-@ <unk> considered taking the risk , believing ( correctly ) that the name belonged to a mountain in Wales . However , she decided that the potential of losing $ 225 @,@ 000 did not justify the risk and elected to walk away from the question , giving Murray the win and the million dollar prize . 
 Since its introduction to the United States , Who <unk> to Be a <unk> has been credited with not only single @-@ <unk> reviving the game show genre , but also breaking new ground for it . The series revolutionized the look and feel of game shows with its unique lighting system , dramatic music <unk> , and futuristic set . The show also became one of the highest @-@ rated and most popular game shows in U.S. television history , and has been credited with paving the way for the rise of the reality TV phenomenon to prominence throughout the 2000s . 
 The U.S. <unk> also made <unk> out of various lines used on the show . In particular , " Is that your final answer ? " , asked by <unk> 's hosts whenever a contestant 's answer needs to be verified , was popularized by <unk> during his tenure as host , and was also included on TV Land 's special " 100 Greatest TV <unk> and <unk> <unk> " , which aired in 2006 . Meanwhile , during his tenure as host , Cedric signed off shows with a catchphrase of his own , " Watch yo ' <unk> ! " 
 In 2000 , <unk> released two board game <unk> of <unk> as well as a junior edition recommended for younger players . Several video games based on the varying gameplay formats of <unk> have also been released throughout the course of the show 's U.S. history . 
 Who <unk> to Be a <unk> – Play It ! was an attraction at the Disney 's Hollywood Studios theme park ( when it was known as Disney @-@ MGM Studios ) at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando , Florida and at Disney California Adventure Park in <unk> , California . Both the Florida and California Play It ! attractions opened in 2001 ; the California version closed in 2004 , and the Florida version closed in 2006 and was replaced by Toy Story Midway <unk> ! 
 The format in the Play It ! attraction was very similar to that of the television show that inspired it . When a show started , a " <unk> Finger " question was given , and the audience was asked to put the four answers in order ; the person with the fastest time was the first contestant in the Hot <unk> for that show . However , the main game had some differences : for example , contestants competed for points rather than dollars , the questions were set to time limits , and the <unk> @-@ a @-@ Friend <unk> became <unk> a Complete Stranger which connected the contestant to a Disney cast member outside the attraction 's theater who would find a guest to help . After the contestant 's game was over , they were awarded anything from a <unk> pin , to clothing , to a <unk> CD game , to a 3 @-@ night Disney Cruise . 
 Sir <unk> Grenville 's Monument is a monument erected in 1720 on <unk> , then called " Lansdowne Hill " , 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) north @-@ west of the city of Bath , in Somerset , England . It was designated a Grade II * listed building on 1 February 1956 , and a scheduled monument on 12 December 1950 . 
 The monument commemorates the heroism of the Civil War Royalist commander Sir <unk> Grenville ( 1596 @-@ 1643 ) of <unk> , <unk> in Cornwall and <unk> in Devon , who on 5 July 1643 fell mortally wounded at the Battle of Lansdowne , leading his regiment of Cornish <unk> . It was erected by Grenville 's grandson and has been maintained by his descendants . This has included the repair of inscriptions carved on the base of the monument , <unk> Grenville and his forces . 
 The monument was erected in 1720 by George Granville , 1st Baron Lansdowne ( 1666 @-@ <unk> ) , grandson of Sir <unk> and heir male to William Granville , 3rd Earl of Bath ( <unk> ) , great @-@ grandson of Sir <unk> and the last male in the senior line of the family . In 1714 Baron Lansdowne had erected a mural monument to Sir <unk> in the Grenville Chapel in the Church of St James the Great , <unk> , Cornwall , in which parish was situated the Grenville seat of <unk> . 
 The monument has been repaired several times . Initially in 1777 and again in 1828 and then in 1879 , each time the repairs were funded by Granville 's descendants . Note that the original spelling was <unk> Granville but today Grenville or <unk> are commonly used . 
 The <unk> on Sir <unk> Grenville by William Cartwright , a fellow Royalist , who died shortly after Sir <unk> on 29 November 1643 , is inscribed on the monument : 
 Baby Jesus theft is the theft of plastic or ceramic figurines of the infant Jesus from outdoor public and private <unk> displays during the Christmas season . It is an " enduring ( and illegal ) practice " according to New York Times journalist Katie Rogers , " believed to be part of a yearly tradition , often carried out by bored teenagers looking for an easy prank . " The prevalence of such <unk> has caused the owners of outdoor <unk> scenes to protect their property with <unk> devices , surveillance cameras , or by other means . 
 Dozens of communities across America have suffered <unk> of Baby Jesus figurines , and , in some instances , entire <unk> scenes , Washington DC journalist Daniel <unk> reports for Britain 's The Guardian . He observes that it is unclear whether such theft is on the rise , as it is not tracked by federal law enforcement . 
 In 2008 , a Baby Jesus was stolen from First United Methodist Church in <unk> , Pennsylvania and replaced with a <unk> , and , in <unk> Springs , Arkansas , a thief not only stole the Baby Jesus from a public display but <unk> with the concrete block and chain that was supposed to act as a deterrent . Some communities suffer repeat Baby Jesus <unk> . A Baby Jesus was stolen in December 2008 from a Stony Point town display . A town official remarked , " If someone did it as a prank , I don 't find it funny . " The <unk> had been <unk> the year before , and a <unk> next to it had been toppled and broken . 
 During some <unk> of the first decade of the 21st century , the Baby Jesus statue was often stolen from the outdoor <unk> scene in <unk> in Sweden , once thrown into the nearby lake of <unk> . This has led to the <unk> scene , resembling a wooden stable , being closed by nights . 
 Some figurines have been defaced with <unk> or <unk> symbols . In December 2008 , for example , a fiberglass Baby Jesus valued at US $ 375 was stolen from a <unk> Springs , Arkansas park and later recovered , but had been defaced by racial <unk> , a <unk> , and a Hitler <unk> . The eyes were also <unk> out and pieces had been broken off , rendering it damaged beyond repair . 
 In his autobiography , The Long Hard Road Out Of Hell , Marilyn Manson admitted playing a prank in which he and a few friends stole figurines of Jesus then replaced them with <unk> . They sent a <unk> to a newspaper posing as a black radical group saying that it was a protest against " the <unk> of the black man 's wisdom with the so @-@ called ' White Christmas ' . " 
 Some <unk> display owners have taken measures to secure their property against would @-@ be thieves . Others are reluctant to exercise such <unk> . One Indiana man who suffered the loss of his Baby Jesus figurine rebuffed suggestions to secure the figurines on his porch because , " that would be like putting Jesus in jail " . Traditional security measures are not always <unk> . The Baby Jesus <unk> to the National Christmas <unk> at Independence Hall disappeared within days . 
 Some communities , churches , and citizens are employing electronic technology to protect their property . A Texas family , for example , positioned surveillance cameras in their yard and discovered a teenage girl stealing their Baby Jesus figurine , valued at nearly US $ 500 . In 2008 , a security device distributor offered its surveillance cameras and <unk> devices to 200 non @-@ profit religious institutions for a month 's use <unk> . <unk> protection has met with some success . In one case , after a life @-@ size ceramic <unk> figurine disappeared from the lawn of a community center in Wellington , Florida , sheriff 's deputies tracked it to an apartment where it was found lying face @-@ down on a carpet . An 18 @-@ year @-@ old woman was arrested . 
 While Baby Jesus <unk> are largely regarded as <unk> , they are set apart by the involvement of a religious icon . " They think it 's a prank , but it isn 't a prank to some of these people , " Pennsylvania state police <unk> Paul <unk> told The Morning Call newspaper , in regards to an incident in which ten <unk> scene figures were found in a yard after being stolen from across <unk> County , Pennsylvania . " Plus , it 's just wrong to steal the baby Jesus . " 
 Some have wondered if an anti @-@ Christian sentiment <unk> behind the <unk> . Attorney Mike Johnson of the Alliance <unk> Freedom ( formerly the Alliance Defense Fund ) , a Christian legal group , stated , " I suspect most of it is childish <unk> . <unk> , there are adults with an agenda to remove Christ from Christmas . But they tend to occupy themselves with the courts and courtroom of public opinion . " Stephen <unk> , the author of The Battle for Christmas and a retired professor , views Baby Jesus theft as neither innocent vandalism nor religious hate crimes . <unk> writes that , " What it means is that it 's OK to go around violating even pretty important norms , as long as real human harm isn 't being done . It 's not exactly <unk> Christianity , but it is sort of a <unk> challenge to it . It could be Christian kids doing it — and on January 2 they become good Christians again . " 
 Historian Daniel <unk> has argued that , whatever the thieves ' intention , the act puts the culture of Christmas in a different light . " Baby Jesus thieves literally take the Christ out of Christmas , " <unk> writes . " When they do , it becomes apparent that the sacred object is also a piece of property , protected by the law that protects property and this whole apparatus that defends Christmas : fences and lights , tracking devices and private security companies , patrolling police and the courts . The <unk> of Christmas is visible here in a way it might not be , otherwise . That ’ s the power of the joke . " 
 In " The Big Little Jesus , " the December 24 , 1953 episode of the television series <unk> , <unk> . Friday and Smith are called upon to investigate the theft of a Baby Jesus from a church <unk> display on Christmas Eve . Unable to solve the crime , the officers tell the priest that Mass must be celebrated without the Baby Jesus . The figurine is restored when a boy arrives with it in a wagon . He tells the officers that he had vowed that if he got a wagon for Christmas , Baby Jesus would have the first ride . This episode was remade when <unk> went to color ; it is not only the only episode made twice , but the only story not based on an actual police case . The episode was originally broadcast on radio on December 22 , 1953 , making it the only episode to appear on all three Jack Webb versions of the series .

The next morning , <unk> <unk> to find the apartment in a state of neglect and decides to clean it , summoning several animals to her aid . Additionally , the musical number references similar scenes from Disney 's Snow White and the Seven <unk> and Cinderella ( 1950 ) . Based on 1950s music , " Happy Working Song " ' s bridge deliberately references the song " Belle " from Disney 's Beauty and the Beast ( 1991 ) . 
 Musically , " Happy Working Song " shares similarities with the songs " <unk> @-@ Ho " from Snow White and the Seven <unk> , " The Work Song " from Cinderella and " Something There " from Beauty and the Beast . The song has garnered vastly positive reviews , with both film and music critics praising its humorous , witty lyrics , allusions and references to previous Disney films and songs , as well as Adams ' performance . " Happy Working Song " was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 80th Academy Awards in 2008 alongside <unk> 's own " That 's How You Know " and " So Close " , making the film one of only four to achieve this feat . Ultimately , the song lost to " Falling Slowly " from Once ( 2007 ) , while the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences subsequently decided to limit the total number of Best Original Song nominations to only two per film . 
 <unk> Disney composer Alan <unk> became actively creatively involved with <unk> in 2006 , subsequently inviting his longtime collaborator , <unk> Stephen <unk> , with whom <unk> had previously worked on Disney 's <unk> ( 1995 ) and The <unk> of Notre Dame ( 1996 ) , to co @-@ write the songs and musical numbers for <unk> alongside him . <unk> said of the general songwriting process , " the first challenge for us was finding that musical palette and lyrical palette and performance palette that really spoke to everybody and said that we are in the world of early Walt and to have that place to start . " 
 American actress Amy Adams , who portrays <unk> , had previously " worked in musical theater before [ she ] moved to Los Angeles " in order to pursue a career as a film actress , and was therefore " very comfortable with the idea of singing " . Citing both actress and singer Julie Andrews and several Disney <unk> as musical inspiration , Adams decided to perform the film 's first song , " True Love 's Kiss " , in the style of an <unk> before eventually replacing this with a more Broadway musical @-@ style voice for " Happy Working Song " . 
 Several professional film critics have allotted a variety of different terms and nicknames to the animals who appear during the " Happy Working Song " sequence . Neil Smith of BBC Online described the animals who appear during the scene as " a grotesque menagerie of CG <unk> " , while the Orlando Sentinel 's Roger Moore <unk> referred to them as New York 's own " woodland creatures " , writing , " the rats and pigeons are merely the <unk> ones " . <unk> <unk> of The New York Times coined the creatures " urban <unk> . " 
 <unk> , film critics who generally disliked <unk> tended to have mostly positive things to report about " Happy Working Song " . Peter <unk> of The Guardian , who assigned the film a negative score of two out of five stars , in contrast gave " Happy Working Song " a positive review , describing it as " a funny opening song " . Additionally , <unk> drew similarities between the musical number and scenes from Snow White and the Seven <unk> and Disney 's Mary <unk> ( 1964 ) . 
 One of the song 's few negative reviews was written by Mary F. <unk> of the <unk> Costa Times , who opined , " a cleaning crew of <unk> and cockroaches is just real enough to be crass rather than funny " . 
 Empire ranked " Happy Working Song " third on its list of the " 10 Great Musical Numbers " of the decade , writing that although " <unk> set the <unk> for Disney song parodies at <unk> levels ... it 's Amy Adams calling on New York 's creatures of the forest to <unk> up Patrick Dempsey 's apartment that pulls it off to perfection . " 
 " Happy Working Song " was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song at the 80th Academy Awards in 2008 alongside <unk> songs " That 's How You Know " and " So Close " , ultimately dominating the category . However , the song was generally not favored to win by the media in spite of the fact that it was vastly a critical success . According to a poll conducted by Billboard in anticipation of the ceremony , when the magazine asked 155 of its readers " Who gets your vote for best original song in a motion picture at the Academy Awards ? " ; only 5 % of them voted in favor of " Happy Working Song " winning the award while 10 % voted for " So Close " and 24 % voted for " That 's How You Know " . In addition to this , 6 % of readers voted for August Rush 's " <unk> It Up " and 22 % voted for Glen <unk> and <unk> <unk> 's " Falling Slowly " from Once ( 2007 ) . Ultimately , " Happy Working Song " lost to " Falling Slowly " . <unk> believes that his compositions did not win the Best Original Song award because of the fact that three of them had been nominated at once . 
 <unk> , <unk> became the fourth out of only four films in the history of the Academy Awards to receive three separate Academy Award nominations in the Best Original Song category , having been preceded by Disney 's own Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King ( 1994 ) at the 64th and 67th Academy Awards in 1992 and 1995 , respectively , and <unk> ( 2006 ) at the 79th Academy Awards in 2007 . In anticipation of the 81st Academy Awards occurring the following year in 2009 , the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ultimately decided to prohibit and prevent this rare feat from <unk> at upcoming ceremonies by limiting the maximum number of Best Original Song nominations from any one film to a total of only two per film . 
 Adams ' first live performance of " Happy Working Song " was at the 80th Academy Awards ceremony in 2008 . Performing at approximately 6 : 01 pm local time , Adams was reportedly very nervous during and after her performance , revealing to The Huffington Post , " I don 't know how I did that . It 's the thing that was the most terrifying that I 've ever done , and the thing I 'm most proud of in my career . " Subsequently , Adams told <unk> that she would likely perform at the Academy Awards again " As long as [ she ] wasn 't doing it by [ her ] self " . 
 Adams ' live rendition of " Happy Working Song " was generally well @-@ received by critics . George Lang of The <unk> described it as a " <unk> " performance , additionally commenting , " [ Adams is ] great ... and she should have already <unk> up her first Oscar for acting by now . " The Boston Globe 's Wesley Morris wrote , " <unk> Amy Adams sing ... makes you appreciated [ sic ] the magic of the movies . " However , the performance generated some mild controversy revolving around the fact that while Adams was selected to perform " Happy Working Song " , Broadway actress and singer Kristin <unk> was hired to sing " That 's How You Know " live at the ceremony . When questioned about this , Disney executives told the Los Angeles Times that " it 's best [ Adams ] sing ' Happy Working Song ' because it has so many parallels to Julie Andrews in Mary <unk> " . 
 However , some critics and journalists have argued that the decision stemmed from Disney and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ' belief that Adams , predominantly a film actress , would ultimately not be able to perform " That 's How You Know " as adequately as the more experienced <unk> . Additionally , critics noted that while <unk> 's Academy Award performance was staged and choreographed as a large , extravagant number featuring " dozens of <unk> <unk> dancers " , Adams performed by herself on a mostly barren stage highlighted by a " single spotlight " . <unk> commented about the performance , " Adams didn 't do terribly , but she 's no Broadway star , and we felt kind of awful for her . " During an interview , Adams told the New York Post that she was not upset by the Academy 's decision , instead feeling that " That 's How You Know " was the " perfect " for <unk> to perform .

 He retired from the Navy as a captain in 1981 and moved to Arizona , where he entered politics . <unk> to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982 , he served two terms , and was then elected to the U.S. Senate in 1986 , winning re @-@ election easily four times , most recently in 2010 . While generally adhering to conservative principles , McCain at times has had a media reputation as a " <unk> " for his willingness to disagree with his party on certain issues . After being investigated and largely <unk> in a political influence scandal of the 1980s as a member of the <unk> Five , he made campaign finance reform one of his signature concerns , which eventually led to the passage of the McCain @-@ <unk> Act in 2002 . He is also known for his work towards restoring diplomatic relations with Vietnam in the 1990s , and for his belief that the Iraq War should be fought to a successful conclusion . McCain has chaired the Senate Commerce Committee , opposed spending that he considered to be pork barrel , and played a key role in <unk> a crisis over judicial nominations with the bi @-@ partisan group known as the Gang of 14 . 
 McCain ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000 but lost a heated primary season contest to George W. Bush . He secured the nomination in 2008 after coming back from early <unk> , but fell to Democratic candidate Barack Obama in the general election , losing by a 365 – 173 electoral college margin and by 53 – 46 percent in the popular vote . He subsequently adopted more orthodox conservative <unk> and attitudes and largely opposed actions of the Obama administration , especially in regard to foreign policy matters . By 2013 , however , he had become a key figure in the Senate for negotiating deals on certain issues in an otherwise partisan environment . In 2015 , McCain became chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee . 
 John McCain was born on August 29 , 1936 , at Coco Solo Naval Air Station in the Panama Canal Zone , to naval officer John S. McCain Jr . ( 1911 – 1981 ) and <unk> ( Wright ) McCain ( born 1912 ) . He has a younger brother named Joe and an elder sister named Sandy . At that time , the Panama Canal was under U.S. control . 
 McCain 's family tree includes Scots @-@ Irish and English ancestors . His father and his paternal grandfather , John S. McCain Sr. , both became four @-@ star United States Navy admirals . The McCain family followed his father to various naval <unk> in the United States and the Pacific . <unk> , he attended about 20 schools . In 1951 , the family settled in Northern Virginia , and McCain attended Episcopal High School , a private preparatory boarding school in Alexandria . He excelled at wrestling and graduated in 1954 . 
 Following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather , McCain entered the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis . There , he was a friend and informal leader for many of his classmates , and sometimes stood up for targets of bullying . He also became a lightweight boxer . McCain did well in academic subjects that interested him , such as literature and history , but studied only enough to pass subjects he struggled with , such as mathematics . He came into conflict with higher @-@ ranking personnel and did not always obey the rules , which contributed to a low class rank ( <unk> of <unk> ) , despite a high <unk> . McCain graduated in 1958 . 
 McCain 's early military career began when he was commissioned an <unk> and started two and a half years of training at Pensacola to become a naval <unk> . While there , he earned a reputation as a <unk> man . He completed flight school in 1960 , and became a naval pilot of ground @-@ attack aircraft , assigned to A @-@ 1 <unk> squadrons aboard the aircraft carriers USS <unk> and USS Enterprise in the Caribbean and Mediterranean Seas . McCain began as a sub @-@ par <unk> who was at times careless and <unk> ; during the early to mid @-@ 1960s , the planes he was flying crashed twice and once collided with power lines , but he received no major injuries . His aviation skills improved over time , and he was seen as a good pilot , albeit one who tended to " push the envelope " in his flying . 
 On July 3 , 1965 , McCain married Carol <unk> , a model originally from Philadelphia . McCain adopted her two young children Douglas and Andrew . He and Carol then had a daughter named Sidney . 
 McCain requested a combat assignment , and was assigned to the aircraft carrier USS <unk> flying A @-@ 4 <unk> . His combat duty began when he was 30 years old , in mid @-@ 1967 , when <unk> was assigned to a bombing campaign , Operation Rolling Thunder , during the Vietnam War . <unk> in the Gulf of <unk> , McCain and his fellow pilots became frustrated by <unk> from Washington , and he would later write that " In all <unk> , we thought our civilian commanders were complete <unk> who didn 't have the least notion of what it took to win the war . " 
 On July 29 , 1967 , McCain , by then a lieutenant commander , was near the epicenter of the USS <unk> fire . He escaped from his burning jet and was trying to help another pilot escape when a bomb exploded ; McCain was struck in the legs and chest by fragments . The ensuing fire killed 134 sailors and took 24 hours to control . With the <unk> out of commission , McCain volunteered for assignment with the USS <unk> , another aircraft carrier employed in Operation Rolling Thunder . Once there , he would be awarded the Navy Commendation Medal and the Bronze Star for missions flown over North Vietnam . 
 McCain 's capture and subsequent imprisonment began on October 26 , 1967 . He was flying his 23rd bombing mission over North Vietnam when his A @-@ <unk> <unk> was shot down by a missile over Hanoi . McCain fractured both arms and a leg <unk> from the aircraft , and nearly drowned when he <unk> into <unk> <unk> Lake . Some North Vietnamese pulled him ashore , then others crushed his shoulder with a rifle butt and <unk> him . McCain was then transported to Hanoi 's main <unk> <unk> Prison , nicknamed the " Hanoi Hilton " . 
 Although McCain was badly wounded , his captors refused to treat his injuries , beating and <unk> him to get information ; he was given medical care only when the North Vietnamese discovered that his father was a high @-@ ranking admiral . His status as a prisoner of war ( <unk> ) made the front pages of major newspapers . 
 McCain spent six weeks in the hospital while receiving marginal care . By then having lost 50 pounds ( 23 kg ) , in a chest cast , and with his gray hair turned white as snow , McCain was sent to a different camp on the outskirts of Hanoi in December 1967 , into a cell with two other Americans who did not expect him to live a week . In March 1968 , McCain was put into solitary confinement , where he would remain for two years . 
 In mid @-@ 1968 , John S. McCain Jr. was named commander of all U.S. forces in the Vietnam theater , and the North Vietnamese offered McCain early release because they wanted to appear <unk> for propaganda purposes , and also to show other <unk> that elite prisoners were willing to be treated <unk> . McCain turned down the offer ; he would only accept repatriation if every man taken in before him was released as well . Such early release was prohibited by the <unk> 's interpretation of the military Code of Conduct : To prevent the enemy from using prisoners for propaganda , officers were to agree to be released in the order in which they were captured . 
 In August 1968 , a program of severe torture began on McCain . He was subjected to rope <unk> and repeated <unk> every two hours , at the same time as he was suffering from <unk> . Further injuries led to the beginning of a suicide attempt , stopped by guards . Eventually , McCain made an anti @-@ American propaganda " confession " . He has always felt that his statement was <unk> , but as he later wrote , " I had learned what we all learned over there : Every man has his breaking point . I had reached mine . " Many American <unk> were tortured and <unk> in order to extract " <unk> " and propaganda statements ; virtually all of them eventually yielded something to their captors . McCain subsequently received two to three <unk> weekly because of his continued refusal to sign additional statements . 
 McCain refused to meet with various anti @-@ war groups seeking peace in Hanoi , wanting to give neither them nor the North Vietnamese a propaganda victory . From late 1969 onward , treatment of McCain and many of the other <unk> became more <unk> , while McCain continued actively to resist the camp authorities . McCain and other prisoners <unk> the U.S. " Christmas <unk> " campaign of December 1972 , viewing it as a forceful measure to push North Vietnam to terms . 
 <unk> , McCain was a prisoner of war in North Vietnam for five and a half years . He was released on March 14 , 1973 . His wartime injuries left him permanently incapable of raising his arms above his head . 
 McCain 's return to the United States reunited him with his family . His wife Carol had suffered her own <unk> ordeal due to an automobile accident in December 1969 . McCain became a celebrity of sorts , as a returned <unk> . 
 McCain underwent treatment for his injuries , including months of <unk> physical therapy , and attended the National War College at Fort <unk> in Washington , D.C. during 1973 – 1974 . Having been rehabilitated , by late 1974 , McCain had his flight status reinstated , and in 1976 he became commanding officer of a training squadron stationed in Florida . He improved the unit 's flight readiness and safety records , and won the squadron its first @-@ ever <unk> Unit Commendation . During this period in Florida , McCain had <unk> affairs , and the <unk> ' marriage began to <unk> , for which he later would accept blame . 
 McCain served as the Navy 's liaison to the U.S. Senate beginning in 1977 . In <unk> , he has said that this represented his " real entry into the world of politics and the beginning of my second career as a public servant . " His key behind @-@ the @-@ scenes role gained congressional financing for a new <unk> against the wishes of the Carter administration . 
 In April 1979 , McCain met <unk> Lou <unk> , a teacher from Phoenix , Arizona , whose father had founded a large beer <unk> . They began dating , and he urged his wife Carol to grant him a divorce , which she did in February 1980 , with the uncontested divorce taking effect in April 1980 . The settlement included two houses , and financial support for her ongoing medical treatments due to her 1969 car accident ; they would remain on good terms . McCain and <unk> were married on May 17 , 1980 , with Senators William Cohen and Gary Hart attending as <unk> . McCain 's children did not attend , and several years would pass before they reconciled . John and <unk> McCain entered into a <unk> agreement that kept most of her family 's assets under her name ; they would always keep their finances apart and file separate income tax returns . 
 McCain decided to leave the Navy . It was doubtful whether he would ever be promoted to the rank of full admiral , as he had poor annual <unk> and had been given no major sea command . His chances of being promoted to rear admiral were better , but McCain declined that prospect , as he had already made plans to run for Congress and said he could " do more good there . " McCain retired from the Navy on April 1 , 1981 , as a captain . He was designated as disabled and awarded a disability <unk> . Upon leaving the military , he moved to Arizona . His 17 military awards and decorations include the Silver Star , Legion of Merit , Distinguished Flying Cross , Bronze Star and Navy Commendation Medal , for actions before , during , and after his time as a <unk> . 
 Listen , pal . I spent 22 years in the Navy . My father was in the Navy . My grandfather was in the Navy . We in the military service tend to move a lot . We have to live in all parts of the country , all parts of the world . I wish I could have had the luxury , like you , of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the First District of Arizona , but I was doing other things . As a matter of fact , when I think about it now , the place I lived longest in my life was Hanoi . 
 With the assistance of local political endorsements , his Washington connections , as well as money that his wife lent to his campaign , McCain won a highly contested primary election . He then easily won the general election in the heavily Republican district . 
 In 1983 , McCain was elected to lead the incoming group of Republican representatives , and was assigned to the House Committee on Interior Affairs . Also that year , he opposed creation of a federal Martin Luther King Jr . Day , but admitted in 2008 : " I was wrong and eventually realized that , in time to give full support [ in 1990 ] for a state holiday in Arizona . " 
 McCain 's politics at this point were mainly in line with President Ronald Reagan , including support for <unk> , and he was active on Indian Affairs bills . He supported most aspects of the foreign policy of the Reagan administration , including its hardline stance against the Soviet Union and policy towards Central American conflicts , such as backing the <unk> in Nicaragua . McCain opposed keeping U.S. Marines deployed in Lebanon citing <unk> objectives , and subsequently criticized President Reagan for pulling out the troops too late ; in the interim , the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing killed hundreds . McCain won re @-@ election to the House easily in 1984 , and gained a spot on the House Foreign Affairs Committee . In 1985 , he made his first return trip to Vietnam , and also traveled to Chile where he met with its military junta ruler , General Augusto Pinochet . 
 In 1984 , McCain and <unk> had their first child together , daughter <unk> , followed two years later by son John Sidney ( Jack ) IV , and in 1988 by son James ( Jimmy ) . In 1991 , <unk> McCain brought an abandoned three @-@ month @-@ old girl needing medical treatment to the U.S. from a <unk> orphanage run by Mother Teresa . The <unk> decided to adopt her and named her <unk> . 
 McCain 's Senate career began in January 1987 , after he defeated his Democratic opponent , former state <unk> Richard Kimball , by 20 percentage points in the 1986 election . McCain succeeded longtime American conservative icon and Arizona fixture Barry <unk> upon the latter 's retirement as U.S. senator from Arizona . 
 Senator McCain became a member of the Armed Services Committee , with which he had formerly done his Navy liaison work ; he also joined the Commerce Committee and the Indian Affairs Committee . He continued to support the Native American agenda . As first a House member and then a senator – and as a lifelong <unk> with close ties to the gambling industry – McCain was one of the main authors of the 1988 Indian Gaming <unk> Act , which codified rules regarding Native American gambling enterprises . McCain was also a strong supporter of the <unk> @-@ <unk> legislation that enforced automatic spending cuts in the case of budget deficits . 
 McCain soon gained national visibility . He delivered a well @-@ received speech at the 1988 Republican National Convention , was mentioned by the press as a short list vice @-@ presidential running mate for Republican nominee George H. W. Bush , and was named chairman of Veterans for Bush . 
 McCain developed a reputation for independence during the 1990s . He took pride in challenging party leadership and establishment forces , becoming difficult to <unk> politically . 
 As a member of the 1991 – 1993 Senate Select Committee on <unk> / <unk> Affairs , chaired by fellow Vietnam War veteran and Democrat , John Kerry , McCain investigated the Vietnam War <unk> / <unk> issue , to determine the fate of U.S. service personnel listed as missing in action during the Vietnam War . The committee 's unanimous report stated there was " no compelling evidence that proves that any American remains alive in captivity in Southeast Asia . " <unk> by McCain 's efforts , in 1995 the U.S. <unk> diplomatic relations with Vietnam . McCain was vilified by some <unk> / <unk> activists who , unlike the Arizona senator , believed large numbers of Americans were still held against their will in Southeast Asia . Since January 1993 , McCain has been Chairman of the International Republican Institute , an organization partly funded by the U.S. Government that supports the emergence of political democracy worldwide . 
 In 1993 and 1994 , McCain voted to confirm President Clinton 's nominees Stephen <unk> and Ruth <unk> <unk> whom he considered to be qualified for the U.S. Supreme Court . He would later explain that " under our Constitution , it is the president 's call to make . " McCain had also voted to confirm nominees of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George <unk> Bush , including Robert <unk> and Clarence Thomas . 
 McCain attacked what he saw as the <unk> influence of large political contributions – from corporations , labor unions , other organizations , and wealthy individuals – and he made this his signature issue . Starting in 1994 , he worked with Democratic Wisconsin Senator Russ <unk> on campaign finance reform ; their McCain @-@ <unk> bill attempted to put limits on " soft money " . The efforts of McCain and <unk> were opposed by some of the <unk> interests targeted , by <unk> in both parties , by those who felt spending limits <unk> on free political speech and might be unconstitutional as well , and by those who wanted to counterbalance the power of what they saw as media bias . Despite sympathetic coverage in the media , initial versions of the McCain @-@ <unk> Act were <unk> and never came to a vote . 
 The term " <unk> Republican " became a label frequently applied to McCain , and he has also used it himself . In 1993 , McCain opposed military operations in Somalia . Another target of his was pork barrel spending by Congress , and he actively supported the Line Item <unk> Act of 1996 , which gave the president power to veto individual spending items but was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1998 . 
 In the 1996 presidential election , McCain was again on the short list of possible vice @-@ presidential picks , this time for Republican nominee Bob Dole . The following year , Time magazine named McCain as one of the " 25 Most <unk> People in America " . 
 In 1997 , McCain became chairman of the powerful Senate Commerce Committee ; he was criticized for accepting funds from corporations and businesses under the committee 's <unk> , but in response said the small contributions he received were not part of the big @-@ money nature of the campaign finance problem . McCain took on the tobacco industry in 1998 , proposing legislation that would increase cigarette taxes in order to fund anti @-@ smoking campaigns , discourage teenage smokers , increase money for health research studies , and help states pay for smoking @-@ related health care costs . <unk> by the Clinton administration but opposed by the industry and most Republicans , the bill failed to gain <unk> . 
 McCain won re @-@ election to a third <unk> term in November 1998 , prevailing in a landslide over his Democratic opponent , environmental lawyer Ed Ranger . In the February 1999 Senate trial following the <unk> of Bill Clinton , McCain voted to convict the president on both the <unk> and obstruction of justice counts , saying Clinton had violated his sworn oath of office . In March 1999 , McCain voted to approve the NATO bombing campaign against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , saying that the ongoing <unk> of the Kosovo War must be stopped and criticizing past Clinton administration inaction . Later in 1999 , McCain shared the <unk> in Courage Award with <unk> for their work in trying to enact their campaign finance reform , although the bill was still failing repeated attempts to gain <unk> . 
 In August 1999 , McCain 's memoir Faith of My Fathers , co @-@ authored with Mark <unk> , was published ; a reviewer observed that its appearance " seems to have been timed to the <unk> Presidential campaign . " The most successful of his writings , it received positive reviews , became a bestseller , and was later made into a TV film . The book traces McCain 's family background and childhood , covers his time at Annapolis and his service before and during the Vietnam War , concluding with his release from captivity in 1973 . According to one reviewer , it describes " the kind of challenges that most of us can barely imagine . It 's a fascinating history of a remarkable military family . " 
 McCain announced his candidacy for president on September 27 , 1999 , in <unk> , New Hampshire , saying he was staging " a fight to take our government back from the power <unk> and special interests , and return it to the people and the noble cause of freedom it was created to serve " . The leader for the Republican nomination was Texas Governor George W. Bush , who had the political and financial support of most of the party establishment . 
 McCain focused on the New Hampshire primary , where his message appealed to <unk> . He traveled on a campaign bus called the <unk> Talk Express . He held many town hall meetings , answering every question voters asked , in a successful example of " retail politics " , and he used free media to compensate for his lack of funds . One reporter later recounted that , " McCain talked all day long with reporters on his <unk> Talk Express bus ; he talked so much that sometimes he said things that he shouldn 't have , and that 's why the media loved him . " On February 1 , 2000 , he won New Hampshire 's primary with 49 percent of the vote to Bush 's 30 percent . The Bush campaign and the Republican establishment feared that a McCain victory in the crucial South Carolina primary might give his campaign <unk> momentum . 
 The Arizona Republic would write that the McCain – Bush primary contest in South Carolina " has entered national political lore as a low @-@ water mark in presidential campaigns " , while The New York Times called it " a painful symbol of the brutality of American politics " . A variety of interest groups that McCain had challenged in the past ran negative <unk> . Bush borrowed McCain 's earlier language of reform , and declined to <unk> himself from a veterans activist who accused McCain ( in Bush 's presence ) of having " abandoned the veterans " on <unk> / <unk> and Agent Orange issues . 
 McCain lost South Carolina on February 19 , with 42 percent of the vote to Bush 's 53 percent , in part because Bush mobilized the state 's evangelical voters and <unk> McCain . The win allowed Bush to regain lost momentum . McCain would say of the rumor <unk> , " I believe that there is a special place in hell for people like those . " According to one report , the South Carolina experience left McCain in a " very dark place " . 
 McCain 's campaign never completely recovered from his South Carolina defeat , although he did rebound partially by winning in Arizona and Michigan a few days later . He made a speech in Virginia Beach that criticized Christian leaders , including Pat Robertson and Jerry <unk> , as divisive <unk> , declaring " ... we embrace the fine members of the religious conservative community . But that does not mean that we will <unk> to their self @-@ appointed leaders . " McCain lost the Virginia primary on February 29 , and on March 7 lost nine of the thirteen primaries on Super Tuesday to Bush . With little hope of overcoming Bush 's delegate lead , McCain withdrew from the race on March 9 , 2000 . He endorsed Bush two months later , and made occasional appearances with the Texas governor during the general election campaign . 
 McCain began 2001 by breaking with the new George W. Bush administration on a number of matters , including <unk> reform , climate change , and gun legislation ; McCain @-@ <unk> was opposed by Bush as well . In May 2001 , McCain was one of only two Senate Republicans to vote against the Bush tax cuts . Besides the differences with Bush on ideological grounds , there was considerable <unk> between the two remaining from the previous year 's campaign . Later , when a Republican senator , Jim <unk> , became an Independent , thereby throwing control of the Senate to the Democrats , McCain defended <unk> against " self @-@ appointed <unk> of party loyalty " . Indeed , there was speculation at the time , and in years since , about McCain himself leaving the Republican Party , but McCain has always <unk> denied that he ever considered doing so . Beginning in 2001 , McCain used political capital gained from his presidential run , as well as improved legislative skills and relationships with other members , to become one of the Senate 's most influential members . 
 After the September 11 , 2001 attacks , McCain supported Bush and the <unk> war in Afghanistan . He and Democratic senator Joe Lieberman wrote the legislation that created the 9 / 11 Commission , while he and Democratic senator <unk> <unk> co @-@ sponsored the Aviation and Transportation Security Act that <unk> airport security . 
 In March 2002 , McCain @-@ <unk> passed in both Houses of Congress and was signed into law by President Bush . Seven years in the making , it was McCain 's greatest legislative achievement . 
 Meanwhile , in discussions over proposed U.S. action against Iraq , McCain was a strong supporter of the Bush administration 's position . He stated that Iraq was " a clear and present danger to the United States of America " , and voted accordingly for the Iraq War Resolution in October 2002 . He predicted that U.S. forces would be treated as <unk> by a large number of the Iraqi people . In May 2003 , McCain voted against the second round of Bush tax cuts , saying it was <unk> at a time of war . By November 2003 , after a trip to Iraq , he was publicly questioning Secretary of Defense Donald <unk> , saying that more U.S. troops were needed ; the following year , McCain announced that he had lost confidence in <unk> . 
 In October 2003 , McCain and Lieberman co @-@ sponsored the Climate <unk> Act that would have introduced a cap and trade system aimed at returning <unk> gas emissions to 2000 levels ; the bill was defeated with 55 votes to 43 in the Senate . They reintroduced modified versions of the Act two additional times , most recently in January 2007 with the co @-@ sponsorship of Barack Obama , among others . 
 In the 2004 U.S. presidential election campaign , McCain was once again frequently mentioned for the vice @-@ presidential slot , only this time as part of the Democratic ticket under nominee John Kerry . McCain said that Kerry had never formally offered him the position and that he would not have accepted it if he had . At the 2004 Republican National Convention , McCain supported Bush for re @-@ election , praising Bush 's management of the War on Terror since the September 11 attacks . At the same time , he defended Kerry 's Vietnam war record . By August 2004 , McCain had the best favorable @-@ to @-@ unfavorable rating ( 55 percent to 19 percent ) of any national politician ; he campaigned for Bush much more than he had four years previously , though the two remained <unk> allies rather than friends . 
 McCain was also up for re @-@ election as senator , in 2004 . He defeated little @-@ known Democratic <unk> Stuart <unk> with his biggest margin of victory , <unk> 77 percent of the vote . 
 In May 2005 , McCain led the so @-@ called Gang of 14 in the Senate , which established a compromise that preserved the ability of <unk> to <unk> judicial nominees , but only in " extraordinary circumstances " . The compromise took the steam out of the <unk> movement , but some Republicans remained disappointed that the compromise did not eliminate <unk> of judicial nominees in all circumstances . McCain subsequently cast Supreme Court confirmation votes in favor of John Roberts and Samuel <unk> , calling them " two of the finest <unk> ever appointed to the United States Supreme Court . " 
 Breaking from his 2001 and 2003 votes , McCain supported the Bush tax cut extension in May 2006 , saying not to do so would amount to a tax increase . Working with Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy , McCain was a strong proponent of comprehensive immigration reform , which would involve <unk> , guest worker programs , and border enforcement components . The <unk> America and <unk> Immigration Act was never voted on in 2005 , while the <unk> Immigration Reform Act of 2006 passed the Senate in May 2006 but failed in the House . In June 2007 , President Bush , McCain , and others made the strongest push yet for such a bill , the <unk> Immigration Reform Act of 2007 , but it aroused intense <unk> opposition among talk radio listeners and others , some of whom furiously characterized the proposal as an " amnesty " program , and the bill twice failed to gain <unk> in the Senate . 
 By the middle of the 2000s ( decade ) , the increased Indian gaming that McCain had helped bring about was a $ 23 billion industry . He was twice chairman of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee , in 1995 – 1997 and 2005 – 2007 , and his Committee helped expose the Jack <unk> Indian lobbying scandal . By 2005 and 2006 , McCain was pushing for amendments to the Indian Gaming <unk> Act that would limit creation of off @-@ reservation <unk> , as well as limiting the movement of tribes across state lines to build <unk> . 
 Meanwhile , McCain continued questioning the progress of the war in Iraq . In September 2005 , he remarked upon Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Richard Myers ' optimistic outlook on the war 's progress : " Things have not gone as well as we had planned or expected , nor as we were told by you , General Myers . " In August 2006 , he criticized the administration for continually <unk> the effectiveness of the insurgency : " We [ have ] not told the American people how tough and difficult this could be . " From the beginning , McCain strongly supported the Iraq troop surge of 2007 . The strategy 's opponents labeled it " McCain 's plan " and University of Virginia political science professor Larry <unk> said , " McCain owns Iraq just as much as Bush does now . " The surge and the war were unpopular during most of the year , even within the Republican Party , as McCain 's presidential campaign was underway ; faced with the consequences , McCain frequently responded , " I would much rather lose a campaign than a war . " In March 2008 , McCain credited the surge strategy with reducing violence in Iraq , as he made his eighth trip to that country since the war began . 
 McCain formally announced his intention to run for President of the United States on April 25 , 2007 in Portsmouth , New Hampshire . He stated that : " I 'm not running for president to be somebody , but to do something ; to do the hard but necessary things not the easy and <unk> things . " 
 McCain 's oft @-@ cited strengths as a presidential candidate for 2008 included national name recognition , sponsorship of major lobbying and campaign finance reform initiatives , his ability to reach across the aisle , his well @-@ known military service and experience as a <unk> , his experience from the 2000 presidential campaign , and an expectation that he would capture Bush 's top fundraisers . During the 2006 election cycle , McCain had attended 346 events and helped raise more than $ 10 @.@ 5 million on behalf of Republican candidates . McCain also became more willing to ask business and industry for campaign contributions , while maintaining that such contributions would not affect any official decisions he would make . Despite being considered the front @-@ runner for the nomination by <unk> as 2007 began , McCain was in second place behind former Mayor of New York City <unk> <unk> in national Republican polls as the year progressed . 
 McCain had fundraising problems in the first half of 2007 , due in part to his support for the <unk> Immigration Reform Act of 2007 , which was unpopular among the Republican base electorate . Large @-@ scale campaign staff <unk> took place in early July , but McCain said that he was not considering dropping out of the race . Later that month , the candidate 's campaign manager and campaign chief strategist both departed . McCain <unk> badly in national polls , often running third or fourth with 15 percent or less support . 
 The Arizona senator subsequently resumed his familiar position as a political underdog , riding the <unk> Talk Express and taking advantage of free media such as debates and sponsored events . By December 2007 , the Republican race was <unk> , with none of the top @-@ tier candidates dominating the race and all of them possessing major <unk> with different elements of the Republican base electorate . McCain was showing a resurgence , in particular with renewed strength in New Hampshire – the scene of his 2000 triumph – and was bolstered further by the endorsements of The Boston Globe , the New Hampshire Union Leader , and almost two dozen other state newspapers , as well as from Senator Lieberman ( now an Independent Democrat ) . McCain decided not to campaign significantly in the January 3 , 2008 , Iowa <unk> , which saw a win by former Governor of Arkansas Mike <unk> . 
 McCain 's comeback plan paid off when he won the New Hampshire primary on January 8 , defeating former Governor of Massachusetts <unk> Romney in a close contest , to once again become one of the front @-@ runners in the race . In mid @-@ January , McCain placed first in the South Carolina primary , narrowly defeating Mike <unk> . <unk> credited the third @-@ place finisher , Tennessee 's former U.S. Senator Fred Thompson , with drawing votes from <unk> in South Carolina , thereby giving a narrow win to McCain . A week later , McCain won the Florida primary , beating Romney again in a close contest ; <unk> then dropped out and endorsed McCain . 
 On February 5 , McCain won both the majority of states and delegates in the Super Tuesday Republican primaries , giving him a commanding lead toward the Republican nomination . Romney departed from the race on February 7 . McCain 's wins in the March 4 primaries clinched a majority of the delegates , and he became the <unk> Republican nominee . 
 McCain , having been born in the Panama Canal Zone , if elected would have become the first president who was born outside the current 50 states . This raised a potential legal issue , since the United States Constitution requires the president to be a natural @-@ born citizen of the United States . A <unk> legal review , and a unanimous but non @-@ binding Senate resolution , both concluded that he is a natural @-@ born citizen . Also , if inaugurated in 2009 at age 72 years and 144 days , he would have been the oldest U.S. president upon ascension to the presidency , and the second @-@ oldest president to be inaugurated . 
 McCain addressed concerns about his age and past health concerns , stating in 2005 that his health was " excellent " . He had been treated for a type of skin cancer called <unk> , and an operation in 2000 for that condition left a noticeable mark on the left side of his face . McCain 's prognosis appeared favorable , according to independent experts , especially because he had already survived without a recurrence for more than seven years . In May 2008 , McCain 's campaign briefly let the press review his medical records , and he was described as appearing cancer @-@ free , having a strong heart , and in general being in good health . 
 Upon <unk> enough delegates for the nomination , McCain 's focus shifted toward the general election , while Barack Obama and Hillary <unk> Clinton fought a prolonged battle for the Democratic nomination . McCain introduced various policy proposals , and sought to improve his fundraising . <unk> McCain , who accounts for most of the couple 's wealth with an estimated net worth of $ 100 million , made part of her tax returns public in May . After facing criticism about <unk> on staff , the McCain campaign issued new rules in May 2008 to avoid conflicts of interest , causing five top aides to leave . 
 When Obama became the Democrats ' <unk> nominee in early June , McCain proposed joint town hall meetings , but Obama instead requested more traditional debates for the fall . In July , a staff shake @-@ up put Steve Schmidt in full operational control of the McCain campaign . Throughout these summer months , Obama typically led McCain in national polls by single @-@ digit margins , and also led in several key swing states . McCain reprised his familiar underdog role , which was due at least in part to the overall challenges Republicans faced in the election year . McCain accepted public financing for the general election campaign , and the restrictions that go with it , while criticizing his Democratic opponent for becoming the first major party candidate to opt out of such financing for the general election since the system was implemented in 1976 . The Republican 's broad campaign theme focused on his experience and ability to lead , compared to Obama 's . 
 Alaska Governor Sarah Palin was revealed as McCain 's surprise choice for running mate on August 29 , 2008 . McCain was only the second U.S. major @-@ party presidential nominee to select a woman for running mate and the first Republican to do so ; Palin would have become the first female Vice President of the United States if she had been elected . On September 3 , 2008 , McCain and Palin became the Republican Party 's presidential and vice presidential nominees , respectively , at the 2008 Republican National Convention in Saint Paul , Minnesota . McCain <unk> ahead of Obama in national polls following the convention , as the Palin pick <unk> core Republican voters who had previously been wary of him . However , by the campaign 's own later admission , the <unk> of Palin to the national media went poorly , and <unk> reactions to Palin grew increasingly negative , especially among <unk> and other voters concerned about her qualifications . 
 On September 24 , McCain said he was <unk> his campaign , called on Obama to join him , and proposed delaying the first of the general election debates with Obama , in order to work on the proposed U.S. financial system <unk> before Congress , which was targeted at addressing the <unk> <unk> crisis and <unk> crisis . McCain 's intervention helped to give dissatisfied House Republicans an opportunity to propose changes to the plan that was otherwise close to agreement . After Obama declined McCain 's suspension suggestion , McCain went ahead with the debate on September 26 . On October 1 , McCain voted in favor of a revised $ 700 billion rescue plan . Another debate was held on October 7 ; like the first one , polls afterward suggested that Obama had won it . A final presidential debate occurred on October 15 . 
 During and after the final debate , McCain compared Obama 's proposed policies to socialism and often invoked " Joe the <unk> " as a symbol of American small business dreams that would be thwarted by an Obama presidency . McCain barred using the Jeremiah Wright controversy in <unk> against Obama , but the campaign did frequently criticize Obama regarding his purported relationship with Bill <unk> . McCain 's rallies became increasingly <unk> , with attendees <unk> Obama and displaying a growing anti @-@ Muslim and anti @-@ African @-@ American sentiment . After one female McCain supporter said she did not trust Obama because " he 's an Arab " , McCain <unk> replied to the woman , " No <unk> <unk> . He 's a decent family man , citizen , that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues . " McCain 's response was considered one of the finer moments of the campaign and was still being viewed several years later as a marker for <unk> in American politics . Down the stretch , McCain was <unk> by Obama by a four @-@ to @-@ one margin . 
 The election took place on November 4 , and Barack Obama was projected the winner at about 11 : 00 pm Eastern Standard Time ; McCain delivered his concession speech in Phoenix , Arizona about twenty minutes later . In it , he noted the historic and special significance of Obama becoming the nation 's first African American president . In the end , McCain won 173 electoral college votes to Obama 's 365 ; McCain failed to win most of the <unk> states and lost some traditionally Republican ones . McCain gained 46 percent of the nationwide popular vote , compared to Obama 's 53 percent . 
 Following his defeat , McCain returned to the Senate amid varying views about what role he might play there . In mid @-@ November 2008 he met with President @-@ elect Obama , and the two discussed issues they had <unk> on . Around the same time , McCain indicated that he intended to run for re @-@ election to his Senate seat in 2010 . As the inauguration neared , Obama consulted with McCain on a variety of matters , to an extent rarely seen between a president @-@ elect and his defeated rival , and President Obama 's inauguration speech contained an allusion to McCain 's theme of finding a purpose greater than oneself . 
 Nevertheless , McCain emerged as a leader of the Republican opposition to the Obama economic stimulus package of 2009 , saying it had too much spending for too little <unk> effect . McCain also voted against Obama 's Supreme Court nomination of Sonia <unk> – saying that while undeniably qualified , " I do not believe that she shares my belief in judicial restraint " – and by August 2009 was siding more often with his Republican Party on closely divided votes than ever before in his <unk> career . McCain <unk> that the Afghanistan War was <unk> and criticized Obama for a slow process in deciding whether to send additional U.S. troops there . 
 McCain also harshly criticized Obama for scrapping construction of the U.S. missile defense complex in Poland , declined to enter negotiations over climate change legislation similar to what he had proposed in the past , and strongly opposed the Obama health care plan . McCain led a successful <unk> of a measure that would allow repeal of the military 's " Don 't ask , don 't tell " policy towards gays . <unk> involved in McCain 's new direction included Senate staffers leaving , a renewed concern over national debt levels and the scope of federal government , a possible Republican primary challenge from <unk> in 2010 , and McCain 's campaign edge being slow to wear off . As one longtime McCain advisor said , " A lot of people , including me , thought he might be the Republican building bridges to the Obama Administration . But he 's been more like the guy blowing up the bridges . " 
 In early 2010 , a primary challenge from radio talk show host and former U.S. Congressman J. D. <unk> materialized in the 2010 U.S. Senate election in Arizona and drew support from some but not all elements of the <unk> Party movement . With <unk> using the campaign slogan " The <unk> Conservative " , McCain said – despite his own past use of the term on a number of occasions – " I never considered myself a <unk> . I consider myself a person who serves the people of Arizona to the best of his abilities . " The primary challenge coincided with McCain reversing or <unk> his stance on some issues such as the bank <unk> , closing of the <unk> Bay detention facility , campaign finance restrictions , and gays in the military . 
 When the health care plan , now called the <unk> Protection and <unk> Care Act , passed Congress and became law in March 2010 , McCain strongly opposed the landmark legislation not only on its merits but also on the way it had been handled in Congress . As a consequence , he warned that congressional Republicans would not be working with Democrats on anything else : " There will be no cooperation for the rest of the year . They have poisoned the well in what they 've done and how they 've done it . " McCain became a vocal defender of Arizona <unk> 1070 , the April 2010 tough anti @-@ illegal immigration state law that aroused national controversy , saying that the state had been forced to take action given the federal government 's inability to control the border . In the August 24 primary , McCain beat <unk> by a 56 to 32 percent margin . McCain proceeded to easily defeat Democratic city <unk> Rodney <unk> in the general election . 
 In the lame duck session of the <unk> Congress , McCain voted for the compromise Tax Relief , <unk> Insurance <unk> , and Job Creation Act of 2010 , but against the <unk> Act ( which he had once sponsored ) and the New <unk> Treaty . Most prominently , he continued to lead the eventually losing fight against " Don 't ask , don 't tell " repeal . In his opposition , he sometimes fell into anger or hostility on the Senate floor , and called its passage " a very sad day " that would compromise the battle effectiveness of the military . 
 McCain continued to be one of the most frequently appearing guests on the Sunday morning news talk shows . He became one of the most vocal critics of the Obama administration 's handling of the September 11 , 2012 , attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission in <unk> , saying it was a " <unk> " that featured either " a massive cover @-@ up or incompetence that is not acceptable " and that it was worse than the Watergate scandal . As part of this , he and a few other <unk> were successful in blocking the planned nomination of Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice to succeed Hillary <unk> Clinton as U.S. Secretary of State ; McCain 's friend and colleague John Kerry was nominated instead . 
 Regarding the Syrian civil war that had begun in 2011 , McCain repeatedly argued for the U.S. intervening militarily in the conflict on the side of the anti @-@ government forces . He staged a visit to rebel forces inside Syria in May 2013 , the first senator to do so , and called for <unk> the Free Syrian Army with heavy weapons and for the establishment of a no @-@ fly zone over the country . Following reports that two of the people he posed for pictures with had been responsible for the kidnapping of eleven Lebanese <unk> pilgrims the year before , McCain disputed one of the <unk> and said he had not met directly with the other . Following the 2013 <unk> chemical weapons attack , McCain argued again for strong American military action against the government of the Syrian president , <unk> al @-@ <unk> , and in September 2013 cast a Foreign Relations committee vote in favor of Obama 's request to Congress that it authorize a military response . McCain took the lead in criticizing a growing non @-@ <unk> movement within the Republican Party , exemplified by his March 2013 comment that Senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz and Representative Justin <unk> were " <unk> birds " . 
 Various advocacy groups have given Senator McCain scores or grades as to how well his votes align with the positions of each group . The American Conservative Union has awarded McCain a lifetime rating of 82 percent through 2014 , while McCain has an average lifetime 12 percent " Liberal <unk> " from Americans for Democratic Action through 2014 . 
 The non @-@ partisan National Journal rates a Senator 's votes by what percentage of the Senate voted more <unk> than he or she , and what percentage more <unk> , in three policy areas : economic , social , and foreign . For 2005 – 2006 ( as reported in the 2008 <unk> of American Politics ) , McCain 's average ratings were as follows : economic policy : 59 percent conservative and 41 percent liberal ; social policy : 54 percent conservative and 38 percent liberal ; and foreign policy : 56 percent conservative and 43 percent liberal . 
 <unk> such as Robert <unk> and Matthew <unk> have used a formulation devised by William F. Buckley Jr. to describe McCain as " conservative " but not " a conservative " , meaning that while McCain usually tends towards conservative positions , he is not " anchored by the philosophical tenets of modern American <unk> . " Following his 2008 presidential election loss , McCain began adopting more orthodox conservative views ; the magazine National Journal rated McCain along with seven of his colleagues as the " most conservative " Senators for 2010 and he achieved his first 100 percent rating from the American Conservative Union for that year . 
 From the late 1990s until 2008 , McCain was a board member of Project <unk> Smart which was set up by Richard Kimball , his 1986 Senate opponent . The project provides non @-@ partisan information about the political positions of McCain and other candidates for political office . Additionally , McCain uses his Senate website to describe his political positions . 
 McCain 's personal character has been a dominant feature of his public image . This image includes the military service of both himself and his family , the circumstances and tensions surrounding the end of his first marriage and beginning of second , his <unk> political persona , his temper , his admitted problem of occasional ill @-@ considered remarks , and his close ties to his children from both his marriages . 
 McCain 's political appeal has been more <unk> and less ideological compared to many other national politicians . His stature and reputation stem partly from his service in the Vietnam War . He also carries physical <unk> of his war wounds , as well as his <unk> surgery . When campaigning , he <unk> : " I am older than dirt and have more <unk> than <unk> . " 
 Writers often <unk> McCain for his courage not just in war but in politics , and wrote <unk> about him . McCain 's shift of political <unk> and attitudes during and especially after the 2008 presidential campaign , including his self @-@ <unk> of the <unk> label , left many writers expressing sadness and wondering what had happened to the McCain they thought they had known . By 2013 , some aspects of the older McCain had returned , and his image became that of a <unk> of contradictory tendencies , including , as one writer listed , " the <unk> , the former <unk> , the <unk> , the bridge builder , the war hero bent on <unk> the call of self @-@ interest to serve a cause greater than himself , the sore loser , old bull , last lion , loose cannon , happy warrior , elder statesman , lion in winter .... " 
 McCain acknowledges having said <unk> things in years past , though he also says that many stories have been exaggerated . One <unk> comparison suggests that McCain was not the first presidential candidate to have a temper , and cultural critic Julia <unk> argues that voters want leaders who are passionate , engaged , fiery , and feisty . McCain has employed both <unk> and shouting on occasion , although such incidents have become less frequent over the years . Senator Lieberman has made this observation : " It is not the kind of anger that is a loss of control . He is a very controlled person . " Senator <unk> <unk> , who has known McCain for decades and has battled him over <unk> , expressed concern about a McCain presidency : " He is erratic . He is <unk> . He loses his temper and he worries me . " Ultimately <unk> decided to support McCain for president , after it was clear he would win the nomination . 
 All of McCain 's family members are on good terms with him , and he has defended them against some of the negative consequences of his high @-@ profile political lifestyle . His family 's military tradition extends to the latest generation : son John Sidney IV ( " Jack " ) graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 2009 , becoming the fourth generation John S. McCain to do so , and is a helicopter pilot ; son James served two tours with the marines in the Iraq War ; and son Doug flew jets in the navy . His daughter <unk> became a <unk> and <unk> presence in the debate about the future of the Republican Party following the 2008 elections , and showed some of his <unk> tendencies . 
 In addition to his military honors and decorations , McCain has been granted a number of civilian awards and honors . 
 McCain has received honorary degrees from colleges and universities in the United States and internationally . These include ones from <unk> University ( 2000 ) , The Citadel ( 2002 ) , Wake Forest University ( 2002 ) , the University of Southern California ( 2004 ) , Northwestern University ( 2005 ) , Liberty University ( 2006 ) , The New School 2006 ) , and the Royal Military College of Canada ( 2013 ) . He was also made an Honorary <unk> of the University Philosophical Society at Trinity College Dublin in 2005 . 
 The <unk> G. <unk> Chemistry Building was a chemistry laboratory and classroom building on the campus of <unk> College in the town of <unk> , New York . The 42 @,@ 000 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 3 @,@ 900 m2 ) <unk> building stood on the north end of a cluster of other science buildings on the site of the school 's first chemistry laboratory . It was completed in 1984 at a cost of $ 7 @.@ 2 million after the college received money from a fund bequeathed to it in the will of California <unk> and professor <unk> G. <unk> . The structure replaced Sanders Hall of Chemistry and included elements designed to be energy efficient , notably a large wall of glass blocks that designers hoped would passively heat the building . Reviews of the structure were positive when it opened with critics praising the way its form complemented nearby older buildings . By 2015 , many aspects of the building had been evaluated as being in Fair or <unk> condition and the building was demolished in spring 2016 Science Center project , to be replaced by an open green space . 
 <unk> Brothers Laboratory was the first chemistry building on the campus of <unk> College in the town of <unk> , New York , built in 1880 , around 500 feet ( 150 m ) from the college 's Main Building . The Laboratory , which was the first free @-@ standing chemistry structure at a women 's college , stood until 1938 , 29 years after the construction of its replacement , the Ewing & <unk> @-@ designed Sanders Hall of Chemistry . 
 In 1981 , the <unk> G. <unk> Fund granted <unk> $ 1 @.@ 3 million for the construction of a new chemistry building . <unk> was a California @-@ based <unk> , professor , and trustee with the University of Southern California 's School of Medicine as well as with a number of other West Coast schools . Over his lifetime , <unk> donated more than $ 10 million to higher education institutions and upon his death in 1968 , his will established a further $ 44 million for building construction at universities and colleges , with the <unk> that institutions requesting a grant provide at least half the funds for their projects and that his name be prominently displayed on any buildings receiving the funding . While the cost of the building was originally reported to be $ 4 @.@ 5 million , this estimate grew to $ 6 @.@ 5 million by 1984 and would ultimately come to $ 7 @.@ 2 million once the project was completed . The College planned to cover the costs not paid for by the <unk> Fund with a $ 100 million development fundraising program that spanned the entirety of the 1980s . 
 In 2007 , despite being <unk> 's youngest completed academic building , a report by Platt <unk> <unk> White Architects report found that many components of <unk> 's structure were in either Fair or <unk> condition . The structure was slated for demolition in spring 2016 as part of the college 's Science Center project , which also included the construction of the new Bridge for Laboratory Sciences building and the renovations of the New England Building , Sanders Physics , and <unk> Hall . The chemistry department began its move to the Bridge for Laboratory Sciences in summer 2015 and <unk> 's demolition followed . <unk> facade elements , windows , and indoor walls were cut away before the building 's frame was dismantled , concluding on April 22 , 2016 . Once cleared , the former site of <unk> will be an open green space . 
 The <unk> G. <unk> Chemistry Building was designed in the <unk> style . The structure 's exterior walls were constructed from limestone and brick that surround regular glass blocks , each about 4 inches ( 10 cm ) thick with side lengths ranging from 8 to 12 inches ( 20 to 30 cm ) . The brick and limestone walls faced the west , north , and east , while the southern face was primarily glass , a feature designed for efficient energy use ; when sunlight hit the wall , air rose into the building and was heated , then pumped throughout where it aided in the operation of the structure 's 46 <unk> <unk> . The north wall , meanwhile , <unk> designed to be resistant to cold air . The building was well <unk> and its plain outer walls were as uninterrupted in material as possible to keep as much warm air inside the structure as possible in winters . 
 Unusually for winter sports , <unk> has never been popular in Norway . The country had not sent an Olympic team until the 1948 Winter Olympics and there were no previous <unk> tracks in Norway when Oslo was awarded the 1952 Winter Olympics . Two Swiss civil engineers , Heinz <unk> and Emil <unk> , were the main technical consultants for the development of the venue . The steep terrain made construction excessively expensive , resulting in the organizing committee deciding to build a temporary track , without permanent concrete and stone curves . Instead , a new track was constructed each year using snow : the <unk> were built by hand , the tracks were leveled and the structure <unk> with ice until it was hard . 
 The track route was built under supervision of <unk> Lund and Carl <unk> in 1949 and 1950 and subsequently corrected by <unk> . The only fixed installation was a water main which ran along the track , using <unk> as its water source . Engineer Luigi <unk> from Switzerland was hired to supervise the construction of the curves , which cost NOK <unk> @,@ 000 . The track was first constructed for training in 1951 and then for the Olympics in 1952 . 
 There have been occasional proposals that Norway should build a permanent <unk> track , where <unk> was the leading location . The debate died out in the 1990s with the selection of Lillehammer as the host of the 1994 Winter Olympics and the subsequent construction of Lillehammer Olympic <unk> and <unk> Track . Also the Oslo bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics proposed using the Lillehammer track . In 2007 , there were two serious accidents in the hill and it was subsequently closed by the police . The municipality then renovated the hill , removing poles and <unk> dangerous edges . 
 The <unk> European <unk> Championships 1937 were the sixth to be contested and the only to have been held in Norway . Six nations competed — Martin <unk> from Germany won both the men 's singles and along with Kurt <unk> the men 's doubles . Norway took all the medals in the women 's singles with <unk> <unk> winning . 
 Two events in <unk> were held at the 1952 Winter Olympics — two @-@ man and four @-@ man . Both were contested over four <unk> over two days . Two @-@ man was contested on 14 and 15 February , while four @-@ man was contested on 21 and 22 February . The same teams won both events , with Germans Andreas <unk> and Lorenz <unk> winning gold in both events and Friedrich <unk> and Franz <unk> winning gold in the four @-@ man . The events attracted up to 15 @,@ 000 spectators . 
 The <unk> di Saint Bon class was a pair of pre @-@ dreadnought battleships built for the Italian Navy ( Italian : Regia Marina ) during the 1890s . The class comprised two ships : <unk> di Saint Bon , the lead ship , and <unk> <unk> . They were armed with a main battery of four 10 @-@ inch ( 254 @-@ millimetre ) guns and were capable of a top speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . Smaller and less powerfully @-@ armed than most contemporary battleships , they marked a brief departure from Italian battleship design , which had previous emphasized large ships equipped with large guns . 
 Both ships served in the active duty squadron early in their careers , and participated in the Italo @-@ Turkish War of 1911 – 12 . They took part in the Italian offensives in North Africa and the island of Rhodes , but did not see combat with the Ottoman fleet . They were reduced to harbor defense ships by the outbreak of World War I , and they spent the war in Venice . The ships were discarded shortly after the end of the war , both having been stricken in 1920 . 
 The previous Italian capital ships , the Re <unk> and the <unk> di <unk> classes of ironclad battleships , marked a period of experimentation on the part of <unk> <unk> , Admiral Simone di <unk> Saint Bon , and the <unk> of the Italian navy . Since the planners had not determined what type of battleship would best suit their strategic needs , the government stepped in and mandated a 10 @,@ 000 @-@ long @-@ ton ( 10 @,@ 000 t ) design smaller than the earlier classes . Following the death of di Saint Bon , <unk> took over the design process and proposed a small battleship armed with 10 in ( 254 mm ) guns , a weaker main battery than those of contemporary foreign designs . 
 The ships , much smaller than their contemporaries , and slower than cruisers , were not particularly useful warships . The mistake of building a battleship of only 10 @,@ 000 tons was not repeated in the subsequent , and much more successful , Regina <unk> class . 
 The ships ' propulsion system consisted of two triple expansion engines ; <unk> di Saint Bon 's were rated at 14 @,@ 296 indicated horsepower ( 10 @,@ <unk> kW ) , while <unk> <unk> 's engines only reached 13 @,@ <unk> <unk> ( 10 @,@ 106 kW ) . Steam for the engines was provided by twelve coal @-@ fired cylindrical water @-@ tube boilers . The ships ' propulsion system provided a top speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) and a range of approximately 5 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 200 km ; 6 @,@ 300 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 The ships were armed with four 10 in ( 254 mm ) 40 @-@ caliber guns manufactured by Armstrong Whitworth . The guns were placed in two twin gun turrets , one forward and one aft . The ships were also equipped with eight 6 in ( 152 mm ) 40 @-@ <unk> guns in individual casemates amidships . These guns were export derivatives of the British QF 6 @-@ inch / 40 gun . <unk> di Saint Bon was also equipped with eight 4 @.@ 7 in ( 119 mm ) 40 @-@ <unk> guns in shielded <unk> mounts directly above the casemate battery and eight 57 mm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) guns and two 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) guns . <unk> <unk> carried six 3 in ( 76 mm ) guns and eight 47 mm ( 1 @.@ 9 in ) guns instead . Both ships also carried four 17 @.@ 7 in ( 450 mm ) torpedo tubes in deck @-@ mounted launchers . 
 The ships were protected with Harvey steel . The main belt was 9 @.@ 8 in ( 249 mm ) thick , and the deck was 2 @.@ 75 in ( 70 mm ) thick . The conning tower was protected by 9 @.@ 8 in of armor plating . The main battery guns had 9 @.@ 8 in thick plating , and the casemates were 5 @.@ 9 in ( 150 mm ) thick . 
 <unk> di Saint Bon was built by the Venice Naval Shipyard . She was laid down on 18 July 1893 , launched on 29 April 1897 , and completed on 24 May 1901 , although she had been commissioned on 1 February 1901 . <unk> <unk> was named after Prince <unk> <unk> , Duke of <unk> . She was built by the <unk> Naval Shipyard in <unk> di <unk> , Naples . She was laid down on 5 October 1893 , launched on 29 September 1897 , and completed on 16 April 1902 , although she had been commissioned on 6 September 1901 . The ships spend the first several years in the active duty squadron until they were replaced by the new Regina <unk> @-@ class battleships , which entered service by 1908 . 
 Both ships took part in the Italo @-@ Turkish War in 1911 – 1912 in the 3rd Division with the two Regina <unk> @-@ class battleships . <unk> <unk> took part in the attack on Tripoli in October 1911 , though <unk> di Saint Bon did not see action in the first months of the war . Both ships participated in the seizure of the island of Rhodes , where <unk> di Saint Bon provided gunfire support to the soldiers ashore . 
 The two ships were slated to be scrapped in 1914 – 15 due to their age , but the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 prevented their disposal . Italy initially remained neutral during the war , but by 1915 , had been convinced by the Triple <unk> to enter the war against Germany and Austria @-@ Hungary . Both <unk> di Saint Bon and <unk> <unk> were used as harbor defense ships in Venice for the duration of the war , and did not see action there . Neither ship remained in service long after the end of the war . <unk> <unk> was stricken from the naval register on 29 March 1920 and <unk> di Saint Bon was stricken on 18 June . Both ships were subsequently discarded . 
 Jon <unk> ( born 2 December 1980 ) is an English semi @-@ professional footballer who plays as a defender or a midfielder for Northern Premier League Premier Division club Stamford .

He was released by the club a year later . 
 Born in Northampton , <unk> , <unk> began his career in the youth system at Rushden & Diamonds . He made his first team debut for the Football Conference club as an 18 @-@ year @-@ old in a Conference League Cup game against <unk> Town on 22 December 1998 . He signed a contract at the end of his scholarship , but after failing to break into the first team squad was released in May 2000 . <unk> dropped two divisions to join Southern League Division One East side Stamford in search of first team football . He impressed with Stamford , moving to Southern League Premier Division side Cambridge City in February 2001 , scoring two goals in 11 league appearances before the end of the 2000 – 01 season . He made 46 appearances , scoring three goals , in the 2001 – 02 season before spending the close season with the Kalamazoo Kingdom in the American <unk> Premier Development League . 
 <unk> returned to England after joining Isthmian League Premier Division side St Albans City on a two @-@ year contract in August 2002 . His debut came in St Albans ' 4 – 0 victory away at Ware in the <unk> Charity Cup first round on 3 August 2002 , before scoring his first goal in a 2 – 0 home win against <unk> <unk> on 26 August . <unk> played in St Albans ' 4 – 1 FA Cup first round defeat to Second Division team <unk> County on 16 November 2002 .

Having made an impressive start for Aldershot , scoring five goals in 12 games , <unk> signed a contract lasting until the end of the 2004 – 05 season on 14 October 2003 . After being sent off in a 2 – 0 home defeat to Margate on 20 December 2003 he was given a three @-@ match suspension , making his return in a 4 – 0 defeat away to <unk> on 24 January 2004 . He played in the 2004 Football Conference play @-@ off Final against Shrewsbury Town at the Britannia Stadium , which Aldershot lost 3 – 0 in a penalty shoot @-@ out after a 1 – 1 draw following extra time . His 2003 – 04 season with Aldershot finished having scored 13 goals in 48 appearances . 
 Aldershot qualified for the play @-@ offs again in the 2004 – 05 season , and <unk> played in both semi @-@ final games against Carlisle United , which ended in a 2 – 2 draw on aggregate . <unk> missed his penalty kick in the penalty shoot @-@ out , before Danny <unk> scored the penalty that secured Carlisle 's place in the play @-@ off final . Having finished the season with nine goals in 44 appearances , <unk> was released by Aldershot on 18 May 2005 , despite being rated as one of the best attacking midfielders in the Conference National . 
 On 20 May 2005 , <unk> joined Conference National side Exeter City on a two @-@ year contract . Manager Alex <unk> described him by saying " He 's 24 years of age and he fits the bill of the type of player that will help us next season . I <unk> him to Tim Cahill of Everton . He likes to get forward and score goals , and has a good <unk> in both League and non @-@ League football . " <unk> made his debut in a 2 – 0 win away at <unk> & <unk> on 13 August 2005 , before scoring his first goal on 3 September in a 2 – 2 away to Dagenham & Redbridge . He scored in a 4 – 0 win over former club Aldershot on 26 December 2005 , during which he was targeted by opposition fans , after his former manager Terry Brown claimed he left Aldershot for financial reasons . After the match , <unk> said " I got one over on the manager and proved him wrong , he didn 't think I was good enough . Their fans were at me throughout the game but it only made me focus more . " He finished the 2005 – 06 season with 13 goals in 48 appearances for Exeter . 
 <unk> was targeted by fellow Conference National side Grays Athletic in December 2006 , but after remaining at Exeter he was offered a new contract at the club in February 2007 , which he did not sign . He played for Exeter in the 2007 Conference National play @-@ off Final on 20 May 2007 , the first Conference play @-@ off final to be played at the new Wembley Stadium . He assisted Lee Phillips ' ninth minute opening goal for Exeter , although the side went on to lose 2 – 1 to Morecambe . <unk> made 48 appearances and scored 10 goals for Exeter in the 2006 – 07 season . 
 <unk> returned to Conference Premier club Rushden & Diamonds after signing a two @-@ year contract on 28 May 2007 . He made his debut in a 1 – 1 draw away at <unk> on 11 August 2007 , before scoring his first goal with Rushden 's only strike in a 1 – 1 draw away at Salisbury City on 8 September . He started the season playing in midfield , but after being played as a striker in late February 2008 he went on a run of scoring six goals in five consecutive games . 
 He appeared for Rushden in the 2008 Conference League Cup Final against Aldershot at the Recreation Ground on 3 April 2008 . The match finished a 3 – 3 draw after extra time , but Aldershot won 4 – 3 in a penalty shoot @-@ out . <unk> made 57 appearances and scored 10 goals for Rushden in the 2007 – 08 season , only missing out on ever @-@ present status after missing the last game of the season against Grays Athletic through injury . 
 He joined Conference Premier rivals Cambridge United on a two @-@ year contract for a £ 15 @,@ 000 fee on 6 August 2008 . His debut came in a 1 – 0 win away to <unk> Victoria on 9 August 2008 , and scored his first goal with a stoppage time winner in a 1 – 0 home win over Lewes on 7 October 2008 . Soon after he was told by manager Gary <unk> to provide more support for the team 's strikers , with <unk> agreeing , saying " It will put the added responsibility on me to start shooting and take some pressure off the forwards . If the midfield can get some goals as well , then that will help the team " . He immediately followed this up with the winning goal against <unk> in a 1 – 0 home win on 11 October 2008 , coming from a low right @-@ footed shot into the corner from 25 yards . 
 <unk> 's first sending off for Cambridge came after receiving a second yellow card during a 5 – 0 home defeat to Crawley Town in the FA Trophy second round on 14 January 2009 . He made his return from suspension in a 1 – 1 home draw with Oxford United on 29 January 2009 . <unk> came on as a 79th minute substitute for Paul <unk> in the 2009 Conference Premier play @-@ off Final at Wembley , in which Torquay United won 2 – 0 . Having struggled to make an impact for Cambridge in the 2008 – 09 season , which he finished with two goals in 39 games , he was transfer @-@ listed . 
 He was sent out on loan for the start of the 2009 – 10 season to divisional rivals Forest Green Rovers for one month on 7 August 2009 . <unk> made his debut the following day in a 2 – 1 home defeat against Kettering Town , going on to make seven appearances at Forest Green . Forest Green had been interested in taking <unk> on another loan , until appointing a new manager . He left Cambridge on loan again after joining Conference Premier rivals Mansfield Town on a two @-@ month loan on 20 November 2009 . <unk> made a scoring debut for Mansfield with the <unk> goal from close range in a 1 – 1 draw at home to <unk> Borough on 21 November 2009 . After making six appearances and scoring one goal in his loan spell , <unk> signed permanently for Mansfield for the rest of the season on 6 January 2010 . He was released by Mansfield at the end of the season , having made 15 appearances and scored two goals after signing permanently . 
 <unk> signed with Southern League Premier Division side <unk> Town in July 2010 , after he had been set to sign for <unk> Town of the Conference North , with whom he had been on trial . He then signed for Conference Premier club Newport County on a short @-@ term contract on 30 October 2010 , making his debut later that day as a 28th @-@ minute substitute for Martin John in a 2 – 1 home defeat to Kettering Town , but was himself substituted in the 73rd minute for Robbie Matthews . <unk> scored on his next appearance for Newport , with the winning goal after netting Sam <unk> 's cross in the 29th minute of extra time in a 1 – 0 victory away at <unk> in an FA Trophy first round replay on 13 December 2010 . He was released by Newport on 30 December 2010 , having made four appearances and scored one goal for the club . 
 He joined Conference Premier side Kettering Town on a contract until the end of the 2010 – 11 season on 18 January 2011 . Kettering were fighting against relegation , and <unk> was quoted as saying " We have to stay positive . We know it 's a transitional period for the club and there is a lot going on " . He made his debut later that day as a half @-@ time substitute for <unk> Wilson in Kettering 's 2 – 1 loss away to Grimsby Town . His first goal for Kettering came in stoppage time against <unk> in a 3 – 1 home victory on 30 April 2011 , having entered the match in the <unk> minute . <unk> finished the season with 14 appearances and one goal for Kettering . He agreed to stay at Kettering ahead of the 2011 – 12 season on non @-@ contract terms , in the belief that a permanent contract would later be agreed , and started the season playing in defensive midfield . 
 On 25 August 2011 , <unk> signed for Conference Premier rivals York City on a contract until January 2012 , having impressed manager Gary Mills when playing against York for Kettering two days earlier . He made his debut a day later , coming on as a 56th @-@ minute substitute for Patrick <unk> in a 0 – 0 draw away to Fleetwood Town . <unk> was soon converted into a right @-@ back at York , a position in which he displayed <unk> and an ability to start attacking moves . His first goal for York came in a 4 – 2 win away at Hayes & <unk> United on 22 October 2011 with a drilled shot into the bottom right corner of the goal from the edge of the penalty box . 
 He signed a new contract with York until the end of the season in January 2012 . He featured in the York side that won 2 – 0 in the 2012 FA Trophy Final at Wembley against his former club Newport on 12 May 2012 . Eight days later he again played at Wembley to win promotion to League Two through the 2012 Conference Premier play @-@ off Final with a 2 – 1 victory over Luton Town . Thus , <unk> was successful in achieving promotion to the Football League in his fourth appearance in a Conference play @-@ off final . Having made 51 appearances and scored three goals for York in the 2011 – 12 season , he signed a new one @-@ year contract with the club in July 2012 . 
 Ahead of <unk> 's first season as a Football League player he was quoted as saying " It 's been a long time coming so I ’ m going to embrace it and enjoy every minute . I think almost every team I have played for has gone on to reach the League so to finally achieve it is a dream come true but it doesn 't end there " . He made his first appearance as a League player in a League Cup first round game away at Doncaster Rovers on 11 August 2012 as an 87th @-@ minute substitute for <unk> . York lost 4 – 2 in a penalty shoot @-@ out after a 1 – 1 extra time draw , although <unk> was successful in converting his penalty . He finished the 2012 – 13 season with 22 appearances before being released by York on 30 April 2013 . 
 <unk> re @-@ signed for Stamford in August 2013 , after playing for the Northern Premier League Premier Division club during pre @-@ season . After impressive performances throughout December 2013 , which culminated in him being named Stamford 's player of the month , <unk> signed a dual registration deal with Conference Premier team FC Halifax Town on 7 January 2014 . He made his debut in a 0 – 0 draw away to <unk> on 11 January 2014 . <unk> made five appearances for FC Halifax before resuming playing for Stamford in February 2014 . He played in the final of the Lincolnshire Senior Cup as Stamford beat <unk> Town 5 – 4 in a penalty shoot @-@ out following a 3 – 3 draw after extra time on 29 April 2014 . <unk> took over as caretaker manager of Stamford on 5 November 2015 , following the sacking of Andrew Wilson . He remained in charge until the appointment of Graham <unk> as manager on 12 November 2015 . 
 <unk> was capped twice by the England National Game XI , the team that represents England at non @-@ League level , making his debut against Belgium on 4 November 2003 before making his second appearance against Italy on 11 February 2004 . 
 <unk> married his wife <unk> during the summer of 2007 . As he is a fan of the Star Wars films , The Imperial March was played as part of the ceremony . 
 HMS Glorious was the second of the <unk> @-@ class battlecruisers built for the Royal Navy during the First World War . Designed to support the Baltic Project championed by the First Sea Lord , Lord Fisher , they were very lightly armoured and armed with only a few heavy guns . Glorious was completed in late 1916 and spent the war patrolling the North Sea . She participated in the Second Battle of <unk> Bight in November 1917 and was present when the German High Seas Fleet surrendered a year later . 
 Glorious was paid off after the end of the war , but was rebuilt as an aircraft carrier during the late 1920s . She could carry 30 % more aircraft than her half @-@ sister Furious which had approximately the same tonnage . After <unk> she spent most of her career operating in the Mediterranean Sea . After the start of the Second World War , Glorious spent the rest of 1939 unsuccessfully hunting for the German cruiser Admiral <unk> <unk> in the Indian Ocean before returning to the Mediterranean . She was recalled in April 1940 to support British operations in Norway . While evacuating British aircraft from Norway in June , the ship was sunk by the German battleships <unk> and <unk> in the North Sea with the loss of over 1 @,@ 200 lives . 
 During the First World War , Admiral Fisher was prevented from ordering an improved version of the preceding <unk> @-@ class battlecruisers by a wartime restriction that banned construction of ships larger than light cruisers . To obtain ships suitable for traditional battlecruiser roles , such as <unk> for fleets and hunting enemy raiders , he settled on a design with the minimal armour of a light cruiser and the armament of a battlecruiser . He justified their existence by claiming he needed fast , shallow @-@ draught ships for his Baltic Project , a plan to invade Germany via its Baltic coast . 
 Glorious had an overall length of <unk> feet 9 inches ( 239 @.@ 8 m ) , a beam of 81 feet ( 24 @.@ 7 m ) , and a draught of 25 feet 10 inches ( 7 @.@ 9 m ) at deep load . She displaced 19 @,@ 180 long tons ( 19 @,@ 490 t ) at load and 22 @,@ 560 long tons ( 22 @,@ 922 t ) at deep load . Glorious and her sisters were the first large warships in the Royal Navy to have geared steam turbines . To save time the installation used in the light cruiser Champion , the first cruiser in the Royal Navy with geared turbines , was simply doubled . The Parsons turbines were powered by eighteen <unk> small @-@ tube boilers . They were designed to produce a total of 90 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 67 @,@ 113 kW ) at a working pressure of 235 <unk> ( 1 @,@ 620 <unk> ; 17 <unk> / <unk> ) . During the ship 's abbreviated sea trials she reached 31 @.@ 42 knots ( 58 @.@ 19 km / h ; 36 @.@ 16 mph ) . 
 The ship was designed to normally carry 750 long tons ( 760 t ) of fuel oil , but could carry a maximum of 3 @,@ 160 long tons ( 3 @,@ 210 t ) . At full capacity , she could steam for an estimated 6 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 11 @,@ 110 km ; 6 @,@ 900 mi ) at a speed of 20 knots ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) . 
 Glorious carried four BL 15 @-@ inch Mark I guns in two twin <unk> powered Mark I * turrets , one each fore ( ' A ' ) and aft ( ' Y ' ) . Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen BL 4 @-@ inch Mark IX guns mounted in six manually powered triple <unk> Mark I mounts . These mounts had the three <unk> too close together and the 23 <unk> tended to interfere with one another . This rather negated the mount 's intended purpose to provide a high rate of fire against torpedo boats and other smaller craft . A pair of QF 3 inch 20 cwt anti @-@ aircraft guns were fitted abreast the <unk> on Glorious . She mounted two submerged tubes for 21 @-@ inch torpedoes and 10 torpedoes were carried . 
 Her keel was laid down on 1 May 1915 by <unk> and <unk> at their Belfast shipyard . Glorious was launched on 20 April 1916 and completed on 14 October 1916 . During her sea trials in November 1916 , <unk> sustained structural damage while running at full speed in a rough head sea and had the damaged areas stiffened shortly afterwards to prevent a recurrence . Glorious did not suffer any similar damage and did not receive her <unk> until 1918 . Upon commissioning , <unk> served with the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron of the Grand Fleet . After most of the 1st Cruiser Squadron was sunk at the Battle of Jutland , the squadron was re @-@ formed with <unk> as flagship along with her sister ship Glorious . She cost £ 1 @,@ <unk> @,@ 223 to build ( costs to 23 <unk> 1916 ) . Glorious received a half a dozen torpedo mounts , each with two tubes in mid @-@ 1917 : one mount on each side of the <unk> on the upper deck and two mounts on each side of the rear turret on the quarterdeck . 
 On 16 October 1917 the Admiralty received word of German ship movements , possibly indicating some sort of raid . Admiral Beatty , the commander of the Grand Fleet , ordered most of his light cruisers and destroyers to sea in an effort to locate the enemy ships . <unk> and Glorious were not initially ordered to sea , but were sent to reinforce the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron patrolling the central part of the North Sea later that day . Two German <unk> @-@ class light cruisers managed to slip through the gaps in the British patrols and destroyed a convoy bound for Norway during the morning of 17 October , but no word was received of the engagement until that afternoon . The 1st Cruiser Squadron were ordered to intercept , but were unsuccessful as the German cruisers were faster than expected . 
 Throughout 1917 the Admiralty was becoming more concerned about German efforts to sweep paths through the British @-@ laid minefields intended to restrict the actions of the High Seas Fleet and German submarines . A preliminary raid on German <unk> forces on 31 October by light forces destroyed ten small ships and the Admiralty decided on a larger operation to destroy the minesweepers and their light cruiser escorts . Based on intelligence reports , the Admiralty allocated the 1st Cruiser Squadron on 17 November 1917 , with cover provided by the reinforced 1st Battlecruiser Squadron and distant cover by the battleships of the 1st Battle Squadron . 
 The German ships , four light cruisers of II Scouting Force , eight destroyers , three divisions of minesweepers , eight <unk> ( <unk> @-@ filled <unk> ) and two <unk> to mark the swept route , were spotted at 7 : 30 am , <unk> by the rising sun . <unk> and the light cruiser Cardiff opened fire with their forward guns seven minutes later . The Germans responded by laying a smoke screen and this made spotting targets very difficult . The British continued in pursuit , but lost track of most of the smaller ships in the smoke and concentrated fire on the light cruisers as opportunity permitted . One 15 @-@ inch hit was made on a gun shield of SMS <unk> , but it did not affect her speed . At 8 : 33 the left @-@ hand gun in Glorious 's forward turret was wrecked when a shell detonated inside the gun barrel . At 9 : 30 the 1st Cruiser Squadron broke off their pursuit so they would not enter a minefield marked on their maps ; the ships turned south , playing no further role in the battle . 
 Glorious required five days of repairs to right the damage caused from the premature detonation and from her own muzzle blast . She fired 57 15 @-@ inch and 213 4 @-@ inch shells during the engagement . The ship received flying @-@ off platforms on top of her turrets in 1918 . A <unk> Camel was carried on the rear turret and a <unk> 1 ½ <unk> on the forward turret . She was present at the surrender of the German fleet on 21 November 1918 . Glorious was reduced to reserve at Rosyth on 1 February 1919 and served as a turret drill ship , being also flagship of the Rear @-@ Admiral Commanding the Devonport Reserve between 1921 and 1922 . 
 The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 severely limited the amount of capital ship tonnage and the Royal Navy was forced to scrap many of its older battleships and battlecruisers . However up to 66 @,@ 000 long tons ( 67 @,@ <unk> t ) of existing ships could be converted into aircraft carriers , for which the <unk> @-@ class ships ' combination of a large hull and high speed made them an ideal candidate for conversion . Glorious began her conversion at Rosyth in 1924 , but was towed to Devonport for completion , and she was re @-@ commissioned on 24 February 1930 . During the ship 's post @-@ conversion sea trials she reached 29 @.@ 47 knots ( 54 @.@ 58 km / h ; 33 @.@ 91 mph ) . Her fifteen @-@ inch turrets were placed into storage and later reused during World War II for HMS <unk> , the Royal Navy 's last battleship . 
 Her new design improved on her half @-@ sister HMS Furious which lacked an island and a conventional funnel . All superstructure , guns , torpedo tubes , and fittings down to the main deck were removed . A two @-@ storey hangar , each level 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) high and 550 feet ( 167 @.@ 6 m ) long , was built on top of the remaining hull ; the upper hangar level opened on to a short flying @-@ off deck , below and forward of the main flight deck . The flying @-@ off deck improved launch and recovery cycle flexibility until new fighters requiring longer takeoff rolls made the lower deck obsolete in the 1930s . Two 46 @-@ by @-@ 48 @-@ foot ( 14 @.@ 0 m × 14 @.@ 6 m ) <unk> were installed fore and aft in the flight deck . An island with the bridge , flying control station , and funnel was added on the starboard side as islands had been found not to contribute significantly to turbulence . By 1939 the ship could carry 34 @,@ 500 imperial gallons ( 157 @,@ 000 l ; 41 @,@ 400 US gal ) of petrol for her aircraft . 
 Glorious received a dual @-@ purpose armament of sixteen QF 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch Mark VIII guns in single High @-@ Angle Mark XII mounts . One mount was on each side of the lower flight deck and a pair was on the quarterdeck . The remaining twelve mounts were distributed along the sides of the ship . During her 1935 refit , Glorious received three <unk> 2 @-@ pounder <unk> @-@ <unk> Mark VI mounts , one on each side of the flying @-@ off deck , forward of the 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch guns , and one behind the island on the flight deck . She also received four water @-@ cooled .50 @-@ calibre Mark III machine guns in a single quadruple mounting . 
 Glorious recommissioned on 24 February 1930 for service with the Mediterranean Fleet , but was attached to the Home Fleet from March to June 1930 . She relieved <unk> in the Mediterranean Fleet in June 1930 and remained there until October 1939 . In a fog on 1 April 1931 Glorious rammed the French ocean liner Florida amidships while steaming at 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) . The impact <unk> 60 feet ( 18 @.@ 3 m ) of the flying @-@ off deck and killed 1 <unk> aboard Glorious and 24 passengers and crew aboard Florida . Glorious was forced to put into Gibraltar to temporary repairs . She had to sail to Malta for permanent repairs which lasted until September 1931 . <unk> in the early 1930s , traverse arresting gear was installed . She was refitted at Devonport from July 1934 to July 1935 where she received two hydraulic <unk> ( <unk> ) on her upper flight deck , which was also extended to the rear , her quarterdeck was raised one deck and she received her multiple <unk> @-@ <unk> mounts . Glorious participated in the Coronation Fleet Review at Spithead on 20 May 1937 for George VI before returning to the Mediterranean . 
 Glorious served briefly with the Mediterranean Fleet for a time after World War II broke out . In October 1939 , she moved through the Suez Canal to the Indian Ocean where she became part of Force J which was organized to hunt for the Admiral <unk> <unk> in the Indian Ocean . It was not successful and Glorious remained in the Indian Ocean until December when she returned to the Mediterranean . 
 Glorious returned on 18 May with six <unk> <unk> amphibious flying boats of 701 Squadron and 18 Hawker Hurricanes of No. 46 Squadron RAF . The latter aircraft had been loaded aboard by crane . The <unk> were quickly flown off to Harstad , but the airfield at <unk> was not yet ready for the Hurricanes and they were still aboard when Glorious returned to Scapa on 21 May . Glorious came back to the Narvik area on 26 May and the Hurricanes were quickly flown off . 
 However , even this success proved to be <unk> and British forces were ordered withdrawn a few days later . The evacuation ( Operation Alphabet ) began in the north on the night of 3 / 4 June and Glorious arrived off the coast on 2 June to provide support although she only carried nine Sea <unk> of <unk> and six <unk> from <unk> Squadrons for self @-@ defence as it was hoped to evacuate the RAF fighters if at all possible . Ten <unk> of 263 Squadron were flown aboard during the afternoon of 7 June and the Hurricanes of 46 Squadron were also flown aboard without any significant problems in the early evening despite having a much higher landing speed than the <unk> . These had been flown off from land bases to keep them from being destroyed in the evacuation after the pilots discovered that a 7 @-@ kilogram ( 15 lb ) <unk> carried in the rear of the Hurricane allowed full brakes to be applied immediately on landing . This was the first time that high performance <unk> without <unk> had been landed on an aircraft carrier . 
 <unk> switched her fire to Glorious at 4 : 32 and scored her first hit six minutes later on her third salvo , at an approximate range of 26 @,@ 000 yards ( 24 @,@ 000 m ) , when one 28 @.@ 3 @-@ <unk> ( 11 @.@ 1 in ) hit the forward flight deck and burst in the upper hangar , starting a large fire . This hit destroyed two <unk> being prepared for flight and the hole in the flight deck prevented any other aircraft from taking off . <unk> penetrated a boiler casing and caused a temporary drop in steam pressure . At 4 : 58 a second shell hit the <unk> beacon above the bridge and killed or wounded the captain and most of the personnel stationed there . The <unk> became effective enough to <unk> the visibility of the Germans from about 4 : 58 to 5 : 20 so they ceased fire on Glorious . 
 Glorious was hit again in the centre engine room at around 5 : 20 and this caused her to lose speed and commence a slow circle to port . She also developed a list to starboard . The German ships closed to within 16 @,@ 000 yards and continued to fire at her until about 5 : 40 . Glorious sank at about 6 : 10 , approximately at 68 ° 38 ′ N 03 ° 50 ′ E , with only 43 survivors . 
 As the German ships approached Glorious , the destroyer <unk> , which had been trying to maintain the <unk> , broke through her own smoke and fired two <unk> of torpedoes at <unk> . One of these hit the battleship at 5 : 34 abreast her rear turret and badly damaged her . <unk> also managed one hit from her 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch guns on <unk> , but was riddled by German gunfire and sank at around 6 : 20 . 
 According to <unk> , survivors ' estimates were that about 900 men abandoned Glorious . The German ships did not try to save survivors . The Royal Navy knew nothing of the sinking until it was announced on German radio . The Norwegian ship <unk> , on passage to the <unk> Islands , arrived late on June 10 and picked up survivors , eventually delivering 37 alive to <unk> of whom two died . Another Norwegian ship , Svalbard II , also making for the <unk> , picked up five survivors but was sighted by a German aircraft and forced to return to Norway , where the four still alive became prisoners of war for the next five years . It is also believed that one more survivor from Glorious was rescued by a German seaplane . Therefore , the total of survivors was 40 , including one each from <unk> and <unk> . The total killed or missing was 1 @,@ 207 from Glorious , 160 from <unk> and 152 from <unk> , a total of 1 @,@ <unk> . 
 The disaster and the failure to mount an effective rescue was clearly an embarrassment for the Royal Navy . All ships encountering the enemy should routinely broadcast a sighting report , and so the lack of a sighting report from Glorious was eventually raised in the House of Commons . It later became known that the heavy cruiser HMS Devonshire had passed within 30 – 50 miles of the battle , flying the flag of Vice Admiral John Cunningham , who was carrying out orders to evacuate the Norwegian Royal Family to the UK and maintain radio silence . Some surviving <unk> from Glorious and HMS Devonshire later testified that the sighting report had been correctly sent , and received by HMS Devonshire , but that it had been suppressed by Cunningham , who departed at high speed in accordance with his orders . It has also been alleged by <unk> that there was some confusion over the use of wireless <unk> frequencies on board Glorious which could have contributed to the failure of any other ship or shore @-@ station to receive a sighting report . <unk> also cites the absence of normal airborne patrols over Glorious and its attendant destroyers , in conditions of maximum visibility , as a <unk> factor to the sinking of Glorious and her escorts . 
 For many years the only memorial to the <unk> lost in the three ships was a stained @-@ glass window in the church of St Peter Martindale in Cumbria , on the east side of <unk> . On 8 June 2010 , 70 years after the loss of Glorious , <unk> and <unk> , a memorial plaque inscribed in English and Norwegian was unveiled near the <unk> Historical Centre in Harstad , Norway , the two destroyers ' last port of call . 
 A model of HMS Glorious by renowned marine model maker Norman A. <unk> , built for the Royal United Services Museum , is now on display in the Fleet Air Arm Museum at <unk> <unk> . 
 The Morgan dollar was a United States dollar coin minted from 1878 to 1904 , and then again in 1921 . It was the first standard silver dollar minted since production of the previous design , the <unk> Liberty dollar , ceased due to the passage of the <unk> Act of 1873 , which also ended the free coining of silver . The coin is named after its designer , United States Mint Assistant Engraver George T. Morgan . The <unk> depicts a profile portrait representing Liberty , while the reverse depicts an eagle with wings <unk> . 
 The dollar was authorized by the <unk> – Allison Act . Following the passage of the 1873 act , mining interests lobbied to restore free silver , which would require the Mint to accept all silver presented to it and return it , struck into coin . Instead , the <unk> – Allison Act was passed , which required the Treasury to purchase between two and four million dollars ' worth of silver at market value to be coined into dollars each month . In 1890 , the <unk> – Allison Act was repealed by the Sherman Silver Purchase Act , which required the Treasury to purchase 4 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 <unk> ounces ( 140 @,@ 000 kg ) of silver each month , but only required further silver dollar production for one year . This act , once again , was repealed in 1893 . 
 In 1898 , Congress approved a bill that required all remaining <unk> purchased under the Sherman Silver Purchase Act to be coined into silver dollars . When those silver reserves were depleted in 1904 , the Mint ceased to strike the Morgan dollar . The <unk> Act , passed in 1918 , authorized the melting and <unk> of millions of silver dollars . <unk> to the act , Morgan dollars resumed mintage for one year in 1921 . The design was replaced by the Peace dollar later the same year . 
 In the early 1960s , a large quantity of <unk> Morgan dollars was found to be available from Treasury vaults , including issues once thought rare . Individuals began purchasing large quantities of the pieces at face value , and eventually the Treasury ceased exchanging silver <unk> for silver coin . Beginning in the 1970s , the Treasury conducted a sale of silver dollars minted at the Carson City Mint through the General Services Administration . In 2006 , Morgan 's reverse design was used on a silver dollar issued to commemorate the old San Francisco Mint building . 
 Beginning in 1876 , several bills were introduced in the House of Representatives in an effort to resume the free coinage of silver . One such bill introduced into the House by Democratic Representative Richard P. <unk> of Missouri was passed in the fall of 1876 . Republican senator William B. Allison of Iowa added important amendments to the bill in the Senate . The House bill allowed Free Silver ; one of Allison 's amendments struck that provision . This same amendment allowed for the issuance of silver <unk> for the first time in United States history . The bill was vetoed by President Rutherford B. Hayes . The president 's veto was <unk> on February 28 , 1878 . What came to be known as the <unk> – Allison Act required that the Treasury purchase between two and four million dollars ' worth of silver per month , to be coined into silver dollars at the former gold / silver value ratio of 16 : 1 , meaning that one <unk> of gold would be valued the same as sixteen ounces of silver . 
 In 1876 , Director of the Mint Henry <unk> began efforts to redesign the nation 's silver coins . <unk> contacted <unk> Fremantle , Deputy Master of the Royal Mint in London , requesting him to " find a first class die @-@ <unk> who would be willing to take the position of Assistant Engraver at the Mint at Philadelphia . " In response to <unk> 's request , Fremantle wrote " My inquiries as to an Assistant Engraver lead me very strongly to recommend for the post Mr. George Morgan , age 30 , who has made himself a considerable name , but for whom there is not much opening at present in this country . " An agreement was reached between <unk> and Morgan for the engraver to work at the Philadelphia Mint under Chief Engraver William <unk> on a six @-@ month trial basis . 
 Morgan arrived in Philadelphia on October 9 , 1876 . His earliest pattern coins designed during his tenure at the Philadelphia Mint were intended for the half dollar . In 1876 , Morgan enrolled as a student at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts to prepare to create a new Liberty head design . Morgan also obtained studies from nature of the bald eagle for preparation of the reverse design . For the representation of Liberty , Morgan sought to depict an American woman rather than the usual Greek – style figures . Morgan 's friend , artist Thomas <unk> , suggested he use Anna <unk> Williams of Philadelphia as a model . In total , Morgan had five <unk> with Williams ; he declared her profile to be the most perfect he had seen . 
 Production of the coins did not commence until March 11 , more than a week after the passage of the <unk> – Allison Act . The first acceptable strike , after adjustments to the press , was coined at 3 : 17 p.m. at the Philadelphia Mint . This piece was given to President Hayes ; the second and third were given to Secretary of the Treasury John Sherman and to Mint Director Henry <unk> . 
 <unk> desired to involve the western mints of San Francisco and Carson City in production in order to help reach the monthly <unk> necessary under the <unk> – Allison Act . <unk> was so great at the Philadelphia Mint that it halted production of all other coins and began operating overtime . Use of the western mints was delayed , however , as all dies were prepared at the Philadelphia Mint , and it was believed that the Western mints did not have the proper equipment to prepare the dies for use . During the second week of production , <unk> pointed out what he called a " slight <unk> " in the dies for the dollar . The reason for the changes was to reduce the relief of the designs and to change the number of tail feathers on the eagle from eight to seven ; this was done because all prior United States coinage depicted the bald eagle as having an odd number of tail feathers . The high relief had caused the dies to have a shorter life . Dies were eventually sent to the Western mints , arriving in both San Francisco and Carson City on April 16 , 1878 . The New Orleans Mint began striking the new silver dollars in 1879 . 
 The Denver Mint , established in 1906 , struck the coins for only one year , in 1921 . The mint marks appearing on the coins are none , representing Philadelphia , " <unk> " for Carson City , " S " for San Francisco , " O " for New Orleans and " D " for Denver . In order to conform to the <unk> Act of 1837 , the Morgan dollar contained ninety percent silver and ten percent copper , measured 38 @.@ 1 millimetres ( 1 @.@ 50 in ) in diameter and weighed <unk> @.@ 5 grains ( 26 @.@ 73 g ) . 
 <unk> of the Morgan dollar remained relatively steady until the passage of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act on July 14 , 1890 . The act , authored by Ohio senator and former Treasury secretary John Sherman , forced the Treasury to increase the amount of silver purchased to 4 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 <unk> ounces ( 140 @,@ 000 kg ) each month . Supporters of the act believed that an increase in the amount of silver purchased would result in inflation , helping to relieve the nation 's farmers . The act also received support from mining interests because such large purchases would cause the price of silver to rise and increase their profits . Despite the Act 's requiring large purchases of silver indefinitely , it provided that the Mint must coin 2 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 silver dollars each month only until 1891 . Since the Treasury already had a surplus of silver dollars , <unk> of dollars dropped sharply beginning in 1892 . The silver that remained after mintage of the dollars was used to mint <unk> , quarters and half dollars . 
 Beginning early in 1893 , a number of industrial firms , including the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad and the National <unk> Company went bankrupt . The resulting bank runs and failures became known as the Panic of 1893 . In June of that year , President <unk> Cleveland , who believed that the Panic was caused by the inflation generated by the Sherman Silver Purchase Act , called a special session of Congress in order to repeal it . The act was repealed on November 1 , 1893 . On June 13 , 1898 , Congress ordered the coining of all the remaining <unk> purchased under the Sherman Silver Purchase Act into silver dollars . Silver dollar production rose again , until the <unk> was exhausted in 1904 , when it ceased . 
 The German government began a propaganda campaign during World War I to discredit the United Kingdom 's currency in India . The Germans convinced Indian citizens that British <unk> in that country could not be <unk> for silver . This led to a run on the British supply of silver . In response , United States Democratic senator Key <unk> of Nevada introduced legislation in 1918 that was intended to offer financial relief to the British government . The bill , passed on April 22 , 1918 , stated that " sales of silver <unk> under authority of this act may be made for the purpose of <unk> the existing stock of gold in the United States , of providing silver for subsidiary coinage and for commercial use , and of assisting foreign governments at war with the enemies of the United States " . The <unk> Act authorized the U.S. to melt up to 350 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 silver dollars , and this commenced immediately after the Act 's passage . The U.S. eventually melted a total of 270 @,@ 232 @,@ <unk> silver dollars . Of that amount , 259 @,@ 121 @,@ <unk> were sold to the United Kingdom at the cost of one dollar per <unk> <unk> . 
 The U.S. only minted the Morgan dollar again during 1921 , the only year in which Morgan dollars were struck at the Denver mint . Since the Treasury had destroyed the obsolete Morgan dollar dies in 1910 , Morgan had to create an entirely new master die . Another provision of the <unk> Act authorized the U.S. to mint a replacement coin for every silver dollar melted . During the same year , the Peace dollar was first issued to commemorate the end of World War I. The Peace dollar was supposedly minted to replace the Morgan dollar under the terms of the <unk> Act but without congressional authorization , despite the fact that the Act did not describe the coin design . The change in design was actually authorized under an 1890 act of Congress , which stated : 
 But no change in the design or die of any coin shall be made <unk> than once in twenty @-@ five years from and including the year of the first adoption of the design , model , die , or hub for the same coin : 
 And provided further , That nothing in this section shall prevent the adoption of new designs or models for devices or <unk> already authorized for the standard silver dollar and the five @-@ cent nickel piece as soon as practicable after the passage of this act . 
 Until 1964 , U.S. citizens could redeem paper money known as silver <unk> for silver dollars at a U.S. Treasury mint on demand . In 1962 , an individual <unk> a silver certificate and received a rare and valuable Morgan dollar in exchange . The coin was from a bag of silver dollars in the vault of the Philadelphia Mint . This incident triggered huge interest , and between November 1962 and March 1964 , millions of Morgan and Peace dollars were sold to the general public . The demand to exchange silver <unk> for silver dollars was so great that lines formed outside of the Treasury Building in Washington , D.C. Some people in line were pushing <unk> . The U.S. Treasury discovered previously unknown mint bags of Carson City dollars in its vaults containing slightly more than 2 @.@ 8 million Carson City silver dollars in the Treasury vaults . Treasury officials decided to hold them back because the total number of coins minted at the Carson City mint were generally lower than others . 
 On May 12 , 1969 , the Joint Commission on <unk> held a meeting in order to determine the best way to sell the Carson City @-@ minted dollars earlier held back by Treasury officials . They recommended a mail bid sale . Legislation was passed on December 31 , 1970 directing the Treasury to transfer the silver dollars to the Administrator of General Services who was given the responsibility for marketing and selling the coins . The legislation also stated that all proceeds from the sale were to be " covered into the Treasury as <unk> receipts . " Congress supplied the General Services Administration with $ 10 million to market the dollar coins . Advertising consisted of posters and <unk> distributed to post offices , banks and various financial institutions , as well as television documentaries . The coins were sorted and mounted in small plastic display cases . The <unk> conducted a total of seven mail bid sales between 1972 and 1980 . In total , the sales generated $ 107 million in revenue . 
 On June 15 , 2006 , legislation was approved that provided for the <unk> of a silver dollar and a five dollar gold coin in " commemoration of the Old Mint at San Francisco , " with <unk> to be given to the San Francisco Museum and Historical Society in an effort to <unk> the Old Mint . In total , 100 @,@ 000 gold and 500 @,@ 000 silver commemorative coins were authorized . <unk> came at the behest of several <unk> publications , who enlisted readers to contact their local <unk> and persuade them to pass necessary legislation . The designs approved for the silver dollar bear a left @-@ frontal view of the Old Mint building and a copy of Morgan 's eagle design on the <unk> and reverse , respectively . Mint artist Joseph <unk> made a new model for the reverse , employing a 1904 San Francisco @-@ minted dollar as his model . 
 Keswick ( / <unk> / ) is an English market town and civil parish , historically in <unk> , and since 1974 in the Borough of <unk> in Cumbria . The town , in the Lake District National Park , just north of <unk> , and 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) from <unk> , had a population of 4 @,@ <unk> at the time of the 2011 census . 
 There is considerable evidence of prehistoric occupation of the Keswick area , but the first recorded mention of the town dates from the 13th century , when Edward I of England granted a charter for Keswick 's market , which has maintained a continuous 700 @-@ year existence . In Tudor times the town was an important mining area , and from the 18th century onwards it has increasingly been known as a holiday centre ; tourism has been its principal industry for more than 150 years . Its features include the <unk> Hall ; a modern theatre , the Theatre by the Lake ; one of Britain 's oldest surviving cinemas , the <unk> ; and the Keswick Museum and Art Gallery in the town 's largest open space , Fitz Park . Among the town 's annual events is the Keswick Convention , an <unk> gathering attracting visitors from many countries . 
 Keswick became widely known for its association with the poets Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert <unk> . Together with their fellow Lake Poet William <unk> , based at <unk> , 12 miles ( 19 km ) away , they made the scenic beauty of the area widely known to readers in Britain and beyond . In the late 19th century and into the 20th , Keswick was the focus of several important initiatives by the growing conservation movement , often led by Hardwicke <unk> , vicar of the nearby <unk> parish and co @-@ founder of the National Trust , which has built up extensive holdings in the area . 
 The town is first recorded in Edward I 's charter of the 13th century , as " <unk> " . Scholars have generally considered the name to be from the Old English , meaning " farm where cheese is made " , the word deriving from " <unk> " ( cheese ) with a Scandinavian initial " k " and " <unk> " ( special place or dwelling ) , although not all academics agree . George <unk> of the University of Illinois ( 1919 ) rejected that derivation on the grounds that a town in the heart of Viking @-@ settled areas , as Keswick was , would not have been given a Saxon name ; he proposed instead that the word is of Danish or Norse origin , and means " <unk> 's place at the bend of the river " . Among the later scholars supporting the " cheese farm " <unk> are <unk> <unk> ( 1960 ) and A D Mills ( 2011 ) ( both Oxford University Press ) , and Diana <unk> ( 2006 ) , for the English Place @-@ Name Society . 
 Evidence of prehistoric occupation in the area includes the <unk> stone circle on the eastern fringe of the town , which has been dated to between 3000 and 2500 BC . Neolithic @-@ era stone tools were unearthed inside the circle and in the centre of Keswick during the 19th century . The <unk> W G <unk> , commenting in 1925 about finds in the area , wrote that they showed " Stone Age man was fairly at home in the Lake District " . There is little evidence of sustained settlement in the area during the Bronze Age , but from excavations of hill forts it is clear that there was some Iron Age occupation , circa 500 BC , although scholars are not agreed about how permanent it was . 
 In Roman Britain Cumbria was the territory of the <unk> . As the site of the western part of <unk> 's Wall , it was of strategic importance . The north of the county is rich in archaeological evidence from the period , but nothing is known that suggests any Roman habitation in the Keswick area , other than finds that point to the existence of one or more Roman highways passing the vicinity of the present @-@ day town . Such nearby settlements as can be traced from the era of the Romans and the years after their departure seem to have been predominantly Celtic . Many local place names from the period , including that of the River <unk> , are Celtic , some closely related to Welsh equivalents . 
 Several Christian saints <unk> the Gospel in the north of England in the late 6th and early 7th centuries AD ; in Keswick and the surrounding area the most important figures were St Herbert of <unk> and his contemporary St <unk> . The former , the pupil and friend of St <unk> of <unk> , lived as a <unk> on an island in <unk> , now named after him . <unk> , who lived and <unk> in the area before moving to Wales , is traditionally held to have founded <unk> Church , which was the parish church of Keswick until the 19th century . 
 Keswick was granted a charter for a market in <unk> by Edward I. This market has an uninterrupted history lasting for more than 700 years . The pattern of buildings around the market square remained broadly the same from this period until at least the late 18th century , with houses – originally timber @-@ framed – <unk> the square , and <unk> enclosed gardens or yards at the back . According to local tradition these stout walls and the narrow entrances to the yards were for defence against <unk> Scots . In the event it appears that the town escaped such attacks , Scottish raiders finding <unk> and more accessible targets at Carlisle and the fertile Eden Valley , well to the north of Keswick . 
 Earlier copper mining had been small in scale , but Elizabeth I , concerned for the defence of her kingdom , required large quantities of copper for the manufacture of weapons and the strengthening of warships . There was the additional advantage for her that the Crown was entitled to royalties on metals extracted from English land . The experts in copper mining were German , and Elizabeth secured the services of Daniel <unk> of <unk> , to whom she granted a licence to " search , dig , try , <unk> and melt all manner of mines and ores of gold , silver , copper and <unk> " in the Keswick area and elsewhere . 
 As well as copper , a new substance was found , extracted and exploited : this was variously called <unk> , black lead , <unk> or black <unk> , and is now known as graphite . Many uses were quickly discovered for the mineral : it reduced friction in machinery , made a heat @-@ resistant <unk> for <unk> , and when used to line moulds for <unk> , resulted in <unk> , <unk> balls that could be fired further by English naval cannon . Later , from the second half of the 18th century , it was used to make pencils , for which Keswick became famous . 
 The copper mines prospered for about seventy years , but by the early 17th century the industry was in decline . <unk> for copper fell and the cost of <unk> it was high . <unk> mining continued , and quarrying for slate began to grow in importance . Other small @-@ scale industries grew up , such as tannery and weaving . Although the boom of the mid @-@ 16th century had finished , the town 's economy did not slide into ruin , and the population remained generally constant at a little under 1 @,@ 000 . 
 During the 18th century and into the 19th , turnpike <unk> were established and major roads in <unk> were greatly improved . With the Lake District now accessible by coach the area attracted well @-@ off visitors , particularly at times of war in mainland Europe , which made the aristocratic Grand Tour impossible there . Regular public coach services were established in the <unk> , but they were expensive . The ten @-@ hour journey from <unk> to <unk> via Keswick cost 12 <unk> ( equivalent to 60 <unk> ) , at a time when country labourers typically earned £ 24 a year or less , and the annual income of even the most prosperous tenant farmers was rarely more than £ 200 . Nonetheless , by the 19th century the number of tourists visiting Keswick during each season was estimated at between 12 @,@ 000 and 15 @,@ 000 . Some of the Keswick <unk> that <unk> for affluent visitors remain as hotels , including the Queen 's , where Gray stayed . 
 In addition to its growing importance as a tourist centre , Keswick developed a reputation for its manufacture of pencils during the 19th century . It had begun on a modest scale in or about 1792 , as a cottage industry , using graphite mined locally . This developed on more industrial lines in factories purpose @-@ built by several companies . <unk> making was the town 's most important manufacturing industry by the mid @-@ 19th century , textiles and leather goods having declined . 
 The <unk> Hall was rebuilt in 1813 , and the lower floor was used as a market house on Saturdays . Coal gas was supplied by a gas works from 1846 ; the Keswick library opened in 1849 ; a water works began operation in 1856 ; and Keswick police station opened in 1857 . The local weekly newspaper , The Keswick <unk> was founded in 1896 , and in 2014 continues to be published every Friday . In an article in The Observer in 1978 , Christopher <unk> wrote that as long as the <unk> <unk> , " there will be one corner of these islands that is forever England . " 
 In 1883 Hardwicke <unk> was appointed vicar of <unk> . In a study of Lake District towns in 1974 , H A L Rice commented that to write about Keswick without mentioning <unk> would be the equivalent of writing about Stratford @-@ upon @-@ Avon without mentioning Shakespeare , so great was <unk> 's impact on the town . He and his wife set up classes to teach metalwork and wood carving ; these grew into the Keswick School of Industrial Art , which trained local craftsmen and <unk> from 1894 until it closed in 1986 . He revived the ancient May Day festival in the town , and was a leading figure in the establishment of Keswick School , <unk> <unk> and the County Farm School . As co @-@ founder of the National Trust , <unk> contributed to Keswick 's continued growth as a tourist centre , with the acquisition by the Trust of many acres of popular scenic land around <unk> , beginning with <unk> Wood in 1902 . 
 Keswick 's history throughout the 20th century was one of increasing reliance on tourism , the pencil industry being the second largest source of employment . The <unk> <unk> Company , formed at the turn of the century , occupied a large factory near the River <unk> on the road leading out of Keswick towards <unk> . The conservation movement continued to develop ; <unk> led successful campaigns to save the medieval <unk> and <unk> bridges from replacement with <unk> @-@ concrete structures ; and the National Trust continued to acquire land locally . In the First World War Keswick lost many of its young men : the war memorial near Fitz Park commemorates 117 names , from a population at the time of less than 4 @,@ 500 . By the 1930s Keswick was firmly established as the main centre of tourism in <unk> and <unk> . An article in The Manchester Guardian in 1934 called it " the capital of the Lake District " , and continued : 
 Keswick 's chief industry is to promote the contentment and happiness of its visitors . Its pleasant position provides at the outset a tonic atmosphere ... it is set in the most delightful part of a delightful district , described by <unk> as " the <unk> spot that ever man has found . " There are numerous places of interest and fine shops , and good accommodation is offered to visitors at reasonable prices . Keswick is the best centre from which to visit <unk> . 
 During the Second World War students from St <unk> 's College , Liverpool and <unk> School , Sussex , were evacuated to Keswick when their own buildings were <unk> for use as a hospital and a navy base respectively . Students were also brought to the safety of Keswick from Central Newcastle High School , <unk> Hall School , Yorkshire , and the Liverpool <unk> . 
 The creation of the Lake District National Park in 1951 , with strict control over new development , prevented any expansion of the town beyond its pre @-@ war borders . Keswick 's population has remained stable at a little below 5 @,@ 000 residents . The town 's reliance on tourism increased in 2006 when <unk> <unk> moved production from Keswick to <unk> , <unk> , only the <unk> <unk> Museum remaining at the old site . At the beginning of the 21st century , more than 60 per cent of the population were employed in hotels , restaurants and distribution . A survey of retail premises in 2000 found that more than ten per cent were outdoor clothes shops , a similar proportion were <unk> or restaurants , and more than eight per cent were gift shops . The age profile of the Keswick population is significantly higher than the English average . In 2011 children under 10 made up 7 @.@ 6 per cent of the town 's population , compared with 11 @.@ 9 per cent for England as a whole . Between ages 10 and 20 the comparable figures are 10 @.@ 2 and 12 @.@ 1 ; and from ages 20 to 44 , 25 @.@ 9 as against 34 @.@ 3 . The percentage of Keswick 's population aged 45 and upwards is above the national average , the largest difference being within the <unk> to 84 @-@ year @-@ old bracket , which contains 9 @.@ 6 per cent of Keswick 's population compared with a national average of 5 @.@ 5 . Figures from the same census show that Keswick has fewer than average " large employers and higher managerial occupations " and more small employers and self @-@ employed people . Long @-@ term unemployment is considerably below the average for England . 
 Keswick became a Local Government District in 1853 and an urban district with three wards in 1894 , reflecting its growth in the latter part of the 19th century . The new urban district 's northern boundary was extended from the <unk> to the railway , taking in Great <unk> and part of <unk> in 1899 . In 1974 the urban district was abolished and since then the town has been administered by Keswick Town Council and <unk> Borough Council . Since 2010 Keswick has been in the <unk> parliamentary constituency , having previously been part of <unk> and before that <unk> and The Border . The electoral ward of Keswick stretches beyond the <unk> of the parish boundary and at the 2011 Census had a total population of 5 @,@ 243 . 
 <unk> , Keswick is in the North West sector of the UK , which is characterised by cool summers , mild winters , and high monthly <unk> throughout the year . The wettest months fall at the end of the year , the peak average of 189 @.@ 3 mm falling in October . Rain , sunshine and temperature figures are shown below . 
 The registers of <unk> Church stated that there were 238 <unk> in 1623 , believed to have been something between a twelfth and a tenth of the whole population of the parish at that time . In the <unk> there was a sharp fall in population , brought on by the plague epidemic which affected Keswick , Carlisle , <unk> and <unk> and other areas in 1645 – 47 . 
 In the 1801 census , the township of Keswick , including the town and surrounding hamlets , had a reported population of 1 @,@ 350 people . The population grew at a steady rate , increasing to 1 @,@ <unk> in 1811 , 1 @,@ <unk> in 1821 , 2 @,@ 159 in 1831 , 2 @,@ <unk> in 1841 , and 2 @,@ 618 in 1851 . In 1871 the township had a population of 2 @,@ <unk> people . The population grew at a faster rate towards the late 19th century and by 1901 it stood at 4 @,@ 451 people . There has been little <unk> in population since , and in the 1991 census the town had a population of 4 @,@ <unk> . In the 2001 census , 4 @,@ <unk> people were recorded , and 4 @,@ <unk> in 2011 . At the 2011 census , 57 @.@ 9 per cent of the population identified as Christian , 31 @.@ 5 per cent as non @-@ religious , 1 @.@ 2 per cent as Muslim and 8 @.@ 3 per cent did not specify . 
 Keswick is the home of the Theatre by the Lake , opened in 1999 . The theatre serves a dual purpose as the permanent home of a professional repertory company and a venue for visiting performers and festivals . It replaced the Century Theatre or " Blue Box " , which had spent 25 years in semi @-@ retirement on a permanent lakeside site in Keswick , after a career of similar length as a mobile theatre . The <unk> cinema in St John Street , opened in 1913 , is one of the oldest continuously functioning cinemas in the country ; it is equipped with digital technology and satellite receiving equipment to allow the live screening of plays , operas and ballet from the National Theatre , Royal Opera House and other venues . 
 The town is the site of the <unk> <unk> Museum . One of the exhibits is what is claimed to be the world 's largest coloured pencil . Fitz Park , on the bank of the River <unk> , is home to the Keswick Museum and Art Gallery , a Victorian museum which features the Musical Stones of <unk> , <unk> manuscripts , and a collection of sculptures and paintings of regional and wider importance , including works by Epstein , John <unk> , Richard <unk> and others . After extensive restoration and enlargement the museum reopened in 2014 . In 2001 the cricket ground in Fitz Park was named the most beautiful in England by Wisden Cricket Monthly . 
 The prominent social thinker and art critic John <unk> , who had many associations with Keswick , once said that the town was a place almost too beautiful to live in . In October 1900 , mainly through the efforts of <unk> , a simple memorial of <unk> slate was erected to <unk> at Friars <unk> . The monument is a now a Grade II listed structure . 
 Until 1838 Keswick had no Anglican church within the town boundaries and was part of the widespread parish of <unk> . The present parish church , St John 's , was designed by Anthony <unk> and consecrated in 1838 . It is <unk> in style , with pink castle @-@ head ashlar sandstone and a slate roof . The church was extended in 1862 , 1882 and 1889 by the parish 's benefactors the Marshall family ; the chancel windows , designed by Henry Holiday , installed in 1879 , were taken down and reinstalled when the chancel was extended in 1889 . St John 's became a Grade II * listed building in 1951 . Keswick 's former parish church , St <unk> 's , at <unk> , just outside the town , is also Grade II * listed . <unk> to at least the 14th century , it is built mainly in the Tudor @-@ Gothic style and was expanded in <unk> and later restored in 1844 by George Gilbert Scott . 
 The Quakers had an early meeting house in the town , replaced in <unk> by one at <unk> . Protestant dissenters met at a private house from <unk> or before , moving to a chapel in Lake Road in the latter part of the 18th century . A Congregational chapel was built in 1858 – 59 . The first <unk> chapel was built in 1814 in a small yard off Main Street at a cost of £ <unk> 10s ; the present Methodist church is in <unk> Street . Since 1928 Roman Catholics in Keswick have been served by Our Lady of the Lakes and St Charles in High Hill . A new Quaker meeting house opened in the town in 1994 . An Eastern Orthodox church was inaugurated in 2007 , holding services in Keswick and the nearby village of <unk> . 
 As at 2014 no other religions maintain dedicated buildings in Keswick ; Muslim worship is accommodated on <unk> in a room at the local council building in Main Street . 
 Keswick 's old <unk> and their successors include many listed buildings , mainly Grade II in designation . The George Hotel , stated to be the oldest inn in the town , dates to the 16th century , with the alterations made during the Georgian period still evident . The King 's Arms Hotel , in the main market square , dates from the early 19th century ; it is built from <unk> stone , with Victorian shop windows on the ground floor . The Queen 's Hotel in Main Street , a <unk> stone building dating from the late 18th century , was renamed " The Inn on the Square " in 2015 . The Bank Tavern in Main Street and The Dog and Gun public house in Lake Road are both Grade II listed 18th @-@ century buildings . 
 The <unk> Free Grammar School , adjoining <unk> churchyard , was an ancient institution , its date of foundation uncertain . In 1819 the parish of <unk> had five or six schools in the town and the outlying areas , with a total of <unk> children . By 1833 Keswick had twelve daily schools , including a new National School at High Hill . The new parish church of Keswick , St John 's , started educational work in 1840 with a Sunday school which also educated infant boys , and later girls , on <unk> . A full @-@ time boys ' school opened in 1853 . For older pupils , Keswick School , the free co @-@ educational grammar school , successor to the <unk> Free Grammar School , opened at a site <unk> opposite <unk> Bridge in 1898 . In 1951 a new secondary modern school was built at <unk> in <unk> . 
 Junior education is provided by St Herbert 's School , which had a roll of 263 in 2013 . At senior level , Keswick and <unk> schools merged in 1980 as a single comprehensive secondary school , with the name Keswick School . It was included in The Daily Telegraph 's list of the top thirty <unk> in England , Wales and Northern Ireland in 2014 . The Local Education Authority for Keswick is Cumbria . 
 The Mary <unk> <unk> Hospital , founded in 1892 , has fifteen beds and a minor injuries unit . It underwent a major rebuilding and upgrade in 2013 .

He spends most of his time in front of the TV in his small office . 
 After a preliminary investigation , Geetha calls <unk> and family for questioning . <unk> , who had predicted that this would happen , had already taught his family how to change their <unk> at the time of murder . When questioned individually , they give the same replies . <unk> also presents the bill of the restaurant , the movie ticket and the bus tickets as proof of their <unk> . Geetha questions the owners of the establishments they have been to and their statements prove <unk> 's <unk> .

 A reviewer from The Hindu noted , " The film takes off as a typical family drama . The first half of the film is intentionally slow @-@ paced and shows to the audience the lighter moments in the family of <unk> . This half combines the elements of drama and comedy genres . The audience gets completely absorbed in the twist of events that begin to unfold from the end of the first half . The second half is more like a thriller and is about how the family , despite the vengeful <unk> of a corrupt <unk> , stands its ground even as the law takes its course . " When asked whether this change in narrative style post @-@ interval was intentional , <unk> replied : " I really don 't understand when people say the first half lacked pace . A story or a film has its own way of progression and it does travel in a <unk> @-@ <unk> away , capturing all the ups and downs of our lives . Right from the start if you accelerate the pace , sooner or later , the story @-@ telling will lose its steam . " 
 When asked whether he had kicked off a new genre in Malayalam — family thriller , a genre which combines the elements of a family drama and thriller , <unk> replied , " I still believe it belongs to the genre ' drama ' , not a thriller . " He also stated in another interview , " We usually brand a film as a thriller , simply because there is some mystery in the narrative or the story <unk> through an investigation . But I don 't <unk> to this . Although there are some twists in the tale and some suspense as well , <unk> is essentially the story of a family . " 
 The film has also been said to be inspired by The <unk> of <unk> X , a Japanese novel written by <unk> <unk> . <unk> Kapoor , who had purchased the Hindi movie rights of the novel , sent a legal notice to the makers of the film . However , the director clarified , " After <unk> 's legal team sent us the letter , I watched the Japanese film , <unk> X , which is an adaptation of the Japanese novel . There could be similarities between my film and that Japanese film , but my film is neither an adaptation nor a copy . The Japanese film is also about a murder cover @-@ up and hence the allegation . <unk> are quite common in the works of creators and that shouldn 't be made into an issue . " <unk> ( 1950 ) was also cited as an inspiration for the film . 
 The film was criticised for the use of some " <unk> dialogues " in the first half which were playing to a certain " new generation " audience . <unk> <unk> of Sify criticised the same and stated about one of such scenes in the film , " it is such banter , which we often dismiss with a laugh , that helps <unk> rape culture . " When asked about this , the director replied , " I firmly believe such conversations are part of our lives . I don 't want to elaborate , but it also throws an insight into each character featured in the sequences . Yes , <unk> , I was a bit worried how the family audience would react to those scenes . But then I read out that part of the script to a select group of women and they <unk> their heads in approval . " 
 There were also allegations that <unk> might provoke murder . Additional Director General of Police ( <unk> ) <unk> claimed that two people accused of murdering a woman from <unk> in February 2014 admitted that their methods for <unk> of the victim 's body and mobile phone SIM card were influenced by the film .

Jennings claimed to have spent $ 1 @,@ 500 a day on his habit , draining his personal finances and leaving him bankrupt with debt up to $ 2 @.@ 5 million . Though he insisted on <unk> the debt and did additional tours to earn the funds , his work became less focused and his tours deteriorated . Jennings decided to quit his <unk> , leased a home in the Phoenix area , and spent a month <unk> himself , intending to start using cocaine again in a more controlled fashion afterward . In 1984 , he quit cocaine . Jennings claimed that his son <unk> was his main inspiration to quit permanently . 
 Jennings 's health had been deteriorating for years before his death . After quitting cocaine , he ended his habit of smoking six packs of cigarettes daily in 1988 . In December 1988 , he underwent triple heart bypass surgery after suffering chest pains while on his tour bus . By 2000 , his diabetes worsened , and the pain reduced his mobility , forcing Jennings to end most touring . Later the same year , he underwent surgery to improve his leg circulation . In December 2001 , his left foot was amputated at a hospital in Phoenix . On February 13 , 2002 , Jennings died in his sleep of <unk> complications in Chandler , Arizona . He was buried in the Mesa City Cemetery , in Mesa , Arizona . At the funeral ceremony , on February 15 , <unk> <unk> sang " Storms Never Last " for the attendees , who included Jennings 's close friends and fellow musicians . 
 Between 1966 and 1995 , 54 Jennings albums charted , with 11 reaching number one . Meanwhile , between 1965 and 1991 , 96 singles charted , with 16 number ones . In October 2001 , Jennings was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame . In one final act of defiance , he did not attend the ceremony and opted instead to send son <unk> Dean Jennings . 
 On July 6 , 2006 , Jennings was inducted to Hollywood 's Rock Wall in Hollywood , California . On June 20 , 2007 , Jennings was posthumously awarded the <unk> Stone Pioneer Award by the Academy of Country Music . 
 Jennings 's music had a major influence on several <unk> and alternative country artists , including Hank Williams , Jr . , The Marshall Tucker Band , Travis <unk> , Steve <unk> , <unk> Johnson , John Anderson , his son , <unk> Jennings , and Hank Williams III . 
 In 2008 , his first posthumous album , <unk> Forever , was released . The album consisted of songs recorded with his son <unk> when he was 16 . In 2012 , <unk> : The Music Inside a three @-@ volume project , consisting of covers of Jennings 's songs by different artists , was released . The same year , it was announced for September the release of <unk> ' Down <unk> ' : The Last Recordings , a set of 12 songs recorded by Jennings and bassist Robby Turner before his death in 2002 . Jennings 's family was reluctant to release any new material because they did not feel comfortable at the time . The songs only featured Jennings and Turner on the bass , while further accompaniment would be added later . Ten years after , Turner completed the recordings with the help of former <unk> . The Jennings family approved the release despite the launch of a new business focused on his estate . <unk> Jennings arranged deals for a clothing line , while also launching a renewed website , and started talks with different producers about the making of a biographical film .

 " Treehouse of Horror X " was directed by Pete <unk> and written by Ron <unk> , <unk> Cary and Tim Long . The episode contains numerous parodies and references to horror and science fiction works , including Doctor Who , I Know What You <unk> Last Summer and <unk> <unk> . It also features actress Lucy <unk> and actors Tom Arnold and Dick Clark as themselves . In its original broadcast , the episode was seen by approximately 8 @.@ 7 million viewers , finishing in 34th place in the ratings the week it aired . Since its airing , the episode received positive reviews from critics . 
 In the opening scene , the two aliens Kang and <unk> introduce a variety show , with a live audience consisting of aliens . While they tell jokes , canned laughter is played , but the audience appears <unk> . The Simpson family sits on the <unk> , with Homer appearing as the jack @-@ in @-@ the @-@ box from " Treehouse of Horror II " , Marge as the witch from " Treehouse of Horror VIII " , Bart as the half @-@ fly mutant from " Treehouse of Horror VIII " . Maggie is the alien / human mutant from " Treehouse of Horror IX " and Lisa is the victim of an axe murder . Lisa then asks what aliens have to do with Halloween , and Maggie , in Kang 's voice , says , " Silence ! " , and <unk> her with a ray gun . 
 In a parody of I Know What You <unk> Last Summer , on a <unk> evening with a full moon , the Simpsons are driving down a coastal road when Marge accidentally smashes into Ned Flanders , killing him . Homer manipulates the body in several <unk> , which convinces <unk> that Ned died of an accident and that he does not want an autopsy . Shortly after Ned 's funeral , the family finds the phrase " I Know What You <unk> ! " written in blood everywhere they go . They are <unk> by a <unk> figure , which drives them out of their house . Again , in the wild , they find Ned . It turns out he lived because he was bitten by a <unk> moments before the accident . Clouds uncover the full moon , Ned changes into a wolf and Marge , Bart , Maggie and Lisa run away . Ned <unk> Homer to death while Homer mocks him . 
 The Medal of Honor is the United States of America 's highest military honor , awarded for personal acts of <unk> above and beyond the call of duty . The medal is awarded by the President of the United States in the name of the U.S. Congress to U.S. military personnel only . There are three versions of the medal , one for the Army , one for the Navy , and one for the Air Force . Personnel of the Marine Corps and Coast Guard receive the Navy version . 
 The Medal of Honor was created as a Navy version in 1861 named the " Medal of <unk> " , and an Army version of the medal named the " Medal of Honor " was established in 1862 to give recognition to men who distinguished themselves " <unk> by gallantry and <unk> " in combat with an enemy of the United States . Because the medal is presented " in the name of Congress " , it is often referred to as the " Congressional Medal of Honor " . However , the official name is the " Medal of Honor " , which began with the U.S. Army 's version . Within United States Code the medal is referred to as the " Medal of Honor " , and less frequently as " Congressional Medal of Honor " . 
 The Medal of Honor is usually presented by the President in a formal ceremony at the White House , intended to represent the gratitude of the American people , with posthumous presentations made to the primary next of <unk> . According to the Medal of Honor Historical Society of the United States , there have been 3 @,@ 515 Medals of Honor awarded to the nation 's soldiers , sailors , airmen , Marines , and Coast Guardsmen since the decoration 's creation , with just less than half of them awarded for actions during the four years of the American Civil War . 
 In 1990 , Congress designated March 25 annually as " National Medal of Honor Day " . Due to its prestige and status , the Medal of Honor is afforded special protection under U.S. law against any unauthorized <unk> , sale , or manufacture , which includes any associated ribbon or badge . 
 <unk> : The <unk> <unk> was a small medal worn on a chain around the neck , similar to a religious medal , that was awarded only to three <unk> from New York state , for the capture of John André , a British officer and spy connected directly to General Benedict Arnold ( American and British general @-@ <unk> ) during the American Revolutionary War ( 1775 – 1783 ) . The capture saved the fort of West Point from the British Army . 
 1782 : Badge of Military Merit : The first formal system for rewarding acts of individual gallantry by American soldiers was established by George Washington when he issued a field order on August 7 , 1782 , for a Badge of Military Merit to recognize those members of the Continental Army who performed " any singular <unk> action " . This decoration is America 's first combat decoration and was preceded only by the <unk> <unk> , the Congressional medal for Henry Lee awarded in September 1779 in recognition of his attack on the British at <unk> Hook , the Congressional medal for General <unk> Gates awarded in November 1777 in recognition of his victory over the British at Saratoga , and the Congressional medal for George Washington awarded in March 1776 . Although the Badge of Military Merit fell into disuse after the American Revolutionary War , the concept of a military award for individual gallantry by members of the U.S. Armed Forces had been established . 
 1847 : Certificate of Merit : After the outbreak of the Mexican @-@ American War ( 1846 – 1848 ) a Certificate of Merit ( <unk> Service <unk> Certificate ) was established by Act of Congress on March 3 , 1847 " to any private soldier who had distinguished himself by gallantry performed in the presence of the enemy " . 539 <unk> were approved for this period . The certificate was discontinued and reintroduced in 1876 effective from June 22 , 1874 to February 10 , 1892 when it was awarded for extraordinary gallantry by private soldiers in the presence of the enemy . From February 11 , 1892 through July 9 , 1918 ( Certificate of Merit <unk> ) it could be awarded to members of the Army for distinguished service in combat or <unk> ; from January 11 , 1905 through July 9 , 1918 the certificate was granted medal status as the Certificate of Merit Medal ( first awarded to a soldier who was awarded the Certificate of Merit for combat action on August 13 , 1898 ) . This medal was later replaced by the Army Distinguished Service Medal which was established on January 2 , 1918 ( the Navy Distinguished Service Medal was established in 1919 ) . Those Army members who held the Distinguished Service Medal in place of the Certificate of Merit could apply for the Army Distinguished Service Cross ( established 1918 ) effective March 5 , 1934 . 
 There were no military awards or medals at the beginning of the Civil War ( 1861 – 1865 ) except for the Certificate of Merit which was awarded for the Mexican @-@ American War . In the fall of 1861 , a proposal for a battlefield decoration for <unk> was submitted to Winfield Scott , the general @-@ in @-@ chief of the army , by Lt. Colonel Edward D. Townsend , an assistant adjutant at the War Department and Scott 's chief of staff . Scott however , was strictly against medals being awarded which was the European tradition . After Scott retired in October 1861 , the Secretary of the Navy , Gideon Welles , adopted the idea of a decoration to recognize and honor distinguished naval service . On December 9 , U.S. Senator ( Iowa ) James W. Grimes , Chairman on the Committee on Naval Affairs , proposed Public Resolution Number 82 ( Bill 82 : 37th Congress , Second Session , 12 <unk> . <unk> ) " to promote the efficiency of the Navy " which included a provision for a Navy Medal of <unk> which was signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln on December 21 , 1861 ( Medal of Honor had been established for the Navy ) , " to be bestowed upon such petty officers , <unk> , <unk> , and marines as shall most distinguish themselves by their gallantry and other <unk> @-@ like qualities during the present war . " Secretary Wells directed the Philadelphia Mint to design the new military decoration . On May 15 , 1862 , the United States Navy Department ordered 175 medals ( $ 1 @.@ 85 each ) with the words " Personal <unk> " on the back from the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia . 
 Senator Henry Wilson , the chairman of the Senate Committee on Military Affairs , introduced a resolution on February 15 , 1862 for an Army Medal of Honor . The resolution ( 37th Congress , Second Session , 12 <unk> . 623 ) was approved by Congress and signed into law on July 12 , 1862 ( " Medals of Honor " were established for enlisted men of the Army ) . This measure provided for <unk> a medal of honor " to such non @-@ commissioned officers and <unk> as shall most distinguish themselves by their gallantry in action and other soldier @-@ like qualities during the present insurrection . " During the war , Townsend would have some medals delivered to some recipients with a letter requesting acknowledgement of the " Medal of Honor " . The letter written and signed by Townsend on behalf of the Secretary of War , stated that the resolution was " to provide for the presentation of medals of honor to the enlisted men of the army and volunteer forces who have distinguished or may distinguish themselves in battle during the present rebellion . " By mid @-@ November the War Department contracted with Philadelphia <unk> William Wilson and Son , who had been responsible for the Navy design , to prepare 2 @,@ 000 Army medals ( $ 2 @.@ 00 each ) to be cast at the mint . The Army version had " The Congress to " written on the back of the medal . Both versions were made of copper and coated with bronze , which " gave them a reddish <unk> " . 
 1863 : Congress made the Medal of Honor a permanent decoration . On March 3 , Medals of Honor were authorized for officers of the Army ( 37th Congress , Third Session , 12 <unk> . <unk> ) . The Secretary of War first presented the Medal of Honor to six Union Army volunteers on March 25 , 1863 in his office . 
 1896 : The ribbon of the Army version Medal of Honor was redesigned with all stripes being vertical . 
 1904 : The <unk> of the Army version of the Medal of Honor was redesigned by General George Lewis Gillespie . The purpose of the redesign was to help distinguish the Medal of Honor from other medals , including a medal issued by the Grand Army of the Republic . 
 1915 : On March 3 , Navy , Marine Corps , and Coast Guard officers became eligible for the Medal of Honor . 
 1965 : A separate design for a version of the medal for the U.S. Air Force was created in 1956 , authorized in 1960 , and officially adopted on April 14 , 1965 . Previously , members of the U.S. Army Air Corps , U.S. Army Air Forces , and the U.S. Air Force received the Army version of the medal . 
 There are three versions of the Medal of Honor , one for each of the military departments of the Department of Defense : Army , Navy , and Air Force . Members of the Marine Corps and Coast Guard are eligible to receive the Navy version . Each is constructed differently and the components are made from <unk> metals and red brass alloys with some gold plating , enamel , and bronze pieces . The United States Congress considered a bill in 2004 which would require the Medal of Honor to be made with 90 % gold , the same composition as the lesser @-@ known Congressional Gold Medal , but the measure was dropped . 
 The Navy version is described as " a five @-@ pointed bronze star , tipped with <unk> containing a crown of <unk> and oak . In the center is Minerva , <unk> the United States , standing with left hand resting on <unk> and right hand holding a shield <unk> with the shield from the coat of arms of the United States . She <unk> <unk> , represented by snakes . The medal is suspended from the <unk> of an anchor . " It is made of solid red brass , <unk> and <unk> . 
 Since 1944 , the Medal of Honor has been attached to a light blue colored <unk> silk Neck ribbon that is 1 3 ⁄ 16 in ( 30 mm ) in width and 21 3 ⁄ 4 in ( 550 mm ) in length . The center of the ribbon displays thirteen white stars in the form of three <unk> . Both the top and middle chevrons are made up of 5 stars , with the bottom <unk> made of 3 stars . The Medal of Honor is one of only two United States military awards suspended from a neck ribbon . The other , the Commander 's <unk> of the Legion of Merit , and is usually awarded to individuals serving foreign governments . 
 On May 2 , 1896 , Congress authorized a " ribbon to be worn with the medal and [ a ] <unk> or knot to be worn in lieu of the medal . " The service ribbon is light blue with five white stars in the form of an " M " . It is placed first in the top position in the order of precedence and is worn for situations other than full @-@ dress military uniform . The <unk> button is a 1 ⁄ 2 @-@ inch ( 13 mm ) , six @-@ sided light blue <unk> <unk> with thirteen white stars and may be worn on appropriate civilian clothing on the left <unk> . 
 In 2011 , Department of Defense instructions were amended to read " for each succeeding act that would otherwise justify award of the Medal of Honor , the individual receiving the subsequent award is authorized to wear an additional Medal of Honor ribbon and / or a ' V ' device on the Medal of Honor suspension ribbon " ( the " V " device is a 1 ⁄ 4 @-@ inch ( 6 @.@ 4 mm ) high bronze miniature letter " V " with <unk> that denotes <unk> ) . The Medal of Honor was the only decoration authorized the use of the " V " device to designate subsequent awards in such fashion . Nineteen individuals , all now deceased , were double Medal of Honor recipients . This was discontinued in July 2014 , and changed to read " A separate <unk> is presented to an individual for each succeeding act that justified award . " As of 2014 , no devices are authorized for the Medal of Honor . 
 The Medal of Honor has evolved in appearance over time . The upside @-@ down star design of the Navy version 's <unk> adopted in early 1862 has not changed since its inception . The Army 1862 version followed and was identical to the Navy version except an eagle perched atop cannons was used instead of an anchor to connect the <unk> to the suspension ribbon . In 1896 , the Army version changed the ribbon 's design and colors due to misuse and imitation by <unk> organizations . In 1904 , the Army " Gillespie " version introduced a smaller redesigned star and the ribbon was changed to the light blue pattern with white stars seen today . In 1913 , the Navy version adopted the same ribbon pattern . 
 After World War I , the Navy decided to separate the Medal of Honor into two versions , one for combat and one for non @-@ combat . The original upside @-@ down star was designated as the non @-@ combat version and a new pattern of the medal <unk> , in cross form , was designed by the <unk> Company in 1919 . It was to be presented to a sailor or Marine who " in action involving actual conflict with the enemy , distinguish [ es ] himself <unk> by gallantry and <unk> at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty " Despite the " actual conflict " guidelines — the <unk> Cross was awarded to Navy <unk> ( later <unk> ) Richard E. <unk> and Floyd Bennett for <unk> exploration . The <unk> Cross itself was not popular . In 1942 , the Navy returned to using only the original 1862 inverted 5 @-@ point star design , and ceased issuing the award for non @-@ combat action . 
 In 1944 , the suspension ribbons for both the Army and Navy version were replaced with the now familiar neck ribbon . When the Air Force version was designed in 1956 , it incorporated similar elements and design from the Army version . It used a larger star with the Statue of Liberty image in place of Minerva on the medal and changed the connecting device from an eagle to an <unk> <unk> flanked with wings as found on the service seal . 
 On October 23 , 2002 , <unk> 107 – <unk> was enacted , <unk> 36 U.S.C. § 903 , authorizing a Medal of Honor flag to be presented to recipients of the decoration . 
 The flag was based on a concept by retired Army Special Forces First Sergeant Bill Kendall of Jefferson , Iowa , who designed a flag to honor Medal of Honor recipient Captain <unk> Lindsey , a B @-@ 26 pilot from Jefferson who was killed in World War II . Kendall 's design of a light blue field <unk> with 13 white five @-@ pointed stars was nearly identical to that of Sarah <unk> 's of the Institute of <unk> . <unk> 's design , ultimately accepted as the official flag , does not include the words " Medal of Honor " and is fringed in gold . The color of the field and the 13 white stars , arranged in the form of a three bar <unk> , consisting of two chevrons of five stars and one <unk> of three stars , emulate the suspension ribbon of the Medal of Honor . The flag has no set proportions . 
 The first Medal of Honor recipient to receive the official Medal of Honor flag was Sergeant First Class Paul R. Smith . The Medal of Honor with the flag was presented by President George W. Bush to his family during a ceremony at the White House on April 4 , 2005 . 
 A special Medal of Honor Flag presentation ceremony was held for over 60 living Medal of Honor recipients on board the USS Constitution on September 30 , 2006 . 
 There are two distinct protocols for <unk> the Medal of Honor . The first and most common is nomination and approval through the chain of command of the service member . The second method is nomination by a member of the U.S. Congress , generally at the request of a constituent . In both cases , if the proposal is outside the time limits for the recommendation , approval to waive the time limit requires a special Act of Congress . The Medal of Honor is presented by the President on behalf of , and in the name of , the Congress . Since 1980 , nearly all Medal of Honor recipients or in the case of posthumous awards , the next of <unk> have been personally decorated by the Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief . Since 1941 , more than half of the Medals of Honor have been awarded posthumously . 
 1800s : Several months after President Abraham Lincoln signed Public Resolution 82 into law on December 21 , 1861 for a Navy medal of honor , a similar resolution was passed in July 1862 for an Army version of the medal . Six Union Army soldiers who <unk> a Confederate <unk> named The General in 1862 , were the first Medal of Honor recipients ; James J. Andrews , a civilian , led the raid . He was caught and hanged as a Union spy , but was a civilian and not eligible to receive the medal . Many Medals of Honor awarded in the 19th century were associated with " saving the flag " ( and country ) , not just for patriotic reasons , but because the U.S. flag was a primary means of battlefield communication at the time . Because no other military decoration was authorized during the Civil War , some seemingly less exceptional and notable actions were recognized by a Medal of Honor during that conflict . 
 1900s : Early in the twentieth century , the Navy awarded many Medals of Honor for peacetime bravery . For instance , in 1901 , John Henry Helms aboard the USS Chicago ( CA @-@ 14 ) was awarded the medal for saving the ship 's cook from drowning . Seven sailors aboard the USS Iowa ( BB @-@ 4 ) were awarded the medal after the ship 's boiler exploded on January 25 , 1904 . Richard <unk> and Floyd Bennett were awarded the medal — combat ( " <unk> " ) version despite the existence then of a non @-@ combat form of the Navy medal — for the 1926 flight they claim reached the North Pole . And Admiral Thomas J. Ryan was awarded the medal for saving a woman from the burning Grand Hotel in Yokohama , Japan , following the 1923 Great <unk> earthquake . Between 1919 and 1942 , the Navy issued two separate versions of the Medal of Honor , one for acts related to combat and one for non @-@ combat bravery . The criteria for the award <unk> during World War I for the Army version of the Medal of Honor , while the Navy version retained a non @-@ combat provision until 1963 . In an Act of Congress of July 9 , 1918 , the War Department version of the medal required that the recipient " distinguish himself <unk> by gallantry and <unk> at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty " , and also required that the act of <unk> be performed " in action involving actual conflict with an enemy " . This was in reaction to the results of the Army Medal of Honor Review Board , which struck 911 medals from the Medal of Honor Roll in February 1917 for lack of basic <unk> . These included the members of the 27th Maine erroneously awarded the medal for <unk> to guard the capital during the Civil War , 29 members of Abraham Lincoln 's funeral detail , and six civilians , including Buffalo Bill <unk> and Mary Edwards Walker ( though the latter 's was restored posthumously in 1977 ) . 
 World War II : Starting in 1942 , the Medal would only be awarded for action in combat , although the Navy version of the Medal of Honor technically allowed non @-@ combat awards until 1963 . Official accounts vary , but generally , the Medal of Honor for combat was known as the " <unk> Cross " , after the company that designed the medal . The <unk> Cross was first awarded in 1919 , but was unpopular partly because of its design . The <unk> Cross Medal of Honor was awarded at least three times for non @-@ combat . By a special authorized Act of Congress , the medal was presented to <unk> and Bennett ( see above ) . In 1942 , the United States Navy reverted to a single Medal of Honor , although the statute still contained a <unk> allowing the award for both " action involving actual conflict with the enemy " or " in the line of his profession " . <unk> from these criteria , approximately 60 percent of the medals earned during and after World War II have been awarded posthumously . 
 Public Law 88 @-@ 77 , July 25 , 1963 : The requirements for the Medal of Honor were standardized among all the services , requiring that a recipient had " distinguished himself <unk> by gallantry and <unk> at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty . " Thus , the act removed the <unk> allowing non @-@ combat awards to Navy personnel . The act also clarified that the act of <unk> must occur during one of three circumstances : 
 While serving with friendly foreign forces engaged in an armed conflict against an opposing armed force in which the United States is not a <unk> party . 
 Congress drew the three <unk> of combat from President Kennedy 's executive order of April 25 , 1962 , which previously added the same criteria to the Purple Heart . On August 24 , Kennedy added similar criteria for the Bronze Star Medal . The amendment was necessary because Cold War armed conflicts did not qualify for consideration under previous statutes such as the 1918 Army Medal of Honor <unk> that required <unk> " in action involving actual conflict with an enemy " , since the United States has not formally declared war since World War II as a result of the provisions of the United Nations Charter . According to congressional testimony by the Army 's Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel , the services were seeking authority to award the Medal of Honor and other <unk> awards <unk> to July 1 , 1958 , in areas such as Berlin , Lebanon , <unk> and <unk> Islands , Taiwan Straits , Congo , Laos , Vietnam , and Cuba . 
 The President may award , and present in the name of Congress , a medal of honor of appropriate design , with ribbons and <unk> , to a person who while a member of the Army ( naval service ; Navy and Marine Corps ) ( Air Force ) ( Coast Guard ) , distinguished himself <unk> by gallantry and <unk> at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty . 
 The Medal of Honor <unk> special privileges on its recipients . By law , recipients have several benefits : 
 Each Medal of Honor recipient may have his or her name entered on the Medal of Honor Roll ( 38 U.S.C. § 1560 ) . 
 Each person whose name is placed on the Medal of Honor Roll is certified to the United States Department of Veterans Affairs as being entitled to receive a monthly <unk> above and beyond any military <unk> or other benefits for which they may be eligible . The <unk> is subject to cost @-@ of @-@ living increases ; as of December 1 , 2012 , it is $ 1 @,@ 259 a month . 
 <unk> receive special <unk> to air transportation under the provisions of <unk> Regulation <unk> @.@ 13 @-@ R. This benefit allows the recipient to travel as he or she deems fit across geographical locations , and allows the recipient 's dependents to travel either Overseas @-@ Overseas , Overseas @-@ Continental US , or Continental US @-@ Overseas when accompanied by the recipient . 
 Special identification cards and <unk> and exchange privileges are provided for Medal of Honor recipients and their eligible dependents . 
 <unk> are granted eligibility for interment at <unk> National Cemetery , if not otherwise eligible . 
 Fully qualified children of recipients are eligible for admission to the United States military academies without regard to the nomination and <unk> requirements . 
 Those awarded the medal after October 23 , 2002 , receive a Medal of Honor Flag . The law specified that all 103 living prior recipients as of that date would receive a flag . 
 As with all medals , retired personnel may wear the Medal of Honor on " appropriate " civilian clothing . Regulations specify that recipients of the Medal of Honor are allowed to wear the uniform " at their pleasure " with standard restrictions on political , commercial , or <unk> purposes ( other former members of the armed forces may do so only at certain ceremonial occasions ) . 
 Most states ( 40 ) offer a special license plate for certain types of vehicles to recipients at little or no cost to the recipient . The states that do not offer Medal of Honor specific license plate offer special license plates for veterans for which recipients may be eligible . 
 Although not required by law or military regulation , members of the <unk> services are encouraged to render <unk> to recipients of the Medal of Honor as a matter of respect and courtesy regardless of rank or status , whether or not they are in uniform . This is one of the few instances where a living member of the military will receive <unk> from members of a higher rank . 
 1904 : The Army redesigned its Medal of Honor . To prevent the making of copies of the medal , Brigadier General George Gillespie , Jr . , a Medal of Honor recipient from the Civil War , applied for and obtained a patent for the new design . General Gillespie received the patent on November 22 , 1904 , and he transferred it the following month to the Secretary of War at the time , William Howard Taft . 
 1923 : Congress enacted a statute ( the year before the 20 @-@ year term of the patent would <unk> ) — which would later be codified at 18 U.S.C. § <unk> — prohibiting the unauthorized wearing , manufacturing , or sale of military medals or decorations . In 1994 , Congress amended the statute to permit an enhanced penalty if the offense involved the Medal of Honor . 
 2005 : Congress enacted the Stolen <unk> Act of 2005 . ( Section 1 of the Act provided that the law could be cited as the " Stolen <unk> Act of 2005 " , but the bill received final passage and was signed into law in 2006 . ) The law amended 18 U.S.C. § <unk> to make it a federal criminal offense for a person to deliberately state falsely that he or she had been awarded a military decoration , service medal , or badge . The law also permitted an enhanced penalty for someone who falsely claimed to have been awarded the Medal of Honor . 
 June 28 , 2012 : In the case of United States v. Alvarez , the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Stolen <unk> Act of 2005 's <unk> of the making of false claims of having been awarded a military medal , decoration , or badge was an unconstitutional violation of the First Amendment 's guarantee of free speech . The case involved an elected official in California , Xavier Alvarez , who had falsely stated at a public meeting that he had been awarded the Medal of Honor , even though he had never served in any branch of the armed forces . 
 The Supreme Court 's decision did not specifically address the <unk> of the older portion of the statute which prohibits the unauthorized wearing , manufacturing , or sale of military medals or decorations . Under the law , the unauthorized wearing , manufacturing , or sale of the Medal of Honor is punishable by a fine of up to $ 100 @,@ 000 and imprisonment of up to one year . 
 June 3 , 2013 : President Barack Obama signs into law a revised version of the Stolen <unk> Act , making it a federal offense for someone to pass themselves off as <unk> of medals for <unk> in order to receive benefits or other privileges ( such as grants , educational benefits , housing , etc . ) that are set aside for veterans and other service members . 
 A number of veteran support organizations and private companies devote themselves to exposing those who falsely claim to have received the Medal of Honor . 
 1996 : <unk> Lordship Industries Inc . , a former Medal of Honor contractor , was fined for selling 300 medals for US $ 75 each . 
 1996 : Fort Lauderdale , Florida , resident Jackie Stern was convicted of wearing a Medal of Honor to which he was not entitled . A federal judge sentenced him to serve one year of <unk> and to write a letter of apology to each of the then @-@ living 171 recipients of the medal . His letter was published in the local newspaper . 
 2003 : Edward <unk> and <unk> <unk> were charged with violating 18 U.S.C. § <unk> ( b ) , <unk> Sale of a Medal of Honor , for selling medals awarded to U.S. Navy <unk> Robert <unk> ( for action in the Spanish – American War ) and to U.S. Army First Sergeant George Washington Roosevelt ( for action in the Civil War ) to an FBI agent . Edward <unk> pleaded guilty and was sentenced to prison . 
 Medal of Honor recipients may apply in writing to the headquarters of the service branch of the medal awarded for a replacement or display Medal of Honor , ribbon , and <unk> ( Medal of Honor flag ) without charge . Primary next of <unk> may also do the same and have any questions answered in regard to the Medal of Honor that was awarded . 
 The Medal of Honor has been awarded to 3 @,@ <unk> different persons . Of the 19 men have been awarded the Medal of Honor twice , 14 received two separate medals for two separate actions , while five received both the Navy and Army Medals of Honor for the same action . As of June 2011 , since the beginning of World War II , <unk> Medals of Honor have been awarded , 523 ( 61 @.@ 45 % ) posthumously . One has been awarded to a woman : Mary Edwards Walker . 
 The first Medals of Honor ( Army ) were awarded by and presented to six " Andrews Raiders " on March 25 , 1863 , by Secretary of War Edwin Stanton , in his office in the War Department . Private Jacob Parrott , a Union Army volunteer from Ohio , became the first recipient of the medal , awarded for his <unk> for and participation in a raid on a Confederate train in Big <unk> , Georgia on April 12 , 1862 during the American Civil War . The six decorated raiders met privately afterward with President Lincoln in his office , in the White House . 
 The first Medal of Honor ( Navy ) was awarded by Secretary of War Stanton to 41 sailors on April 4 , 1863 ( 17 for action during the Battle of <unk> Jackson and St. Philip ) . 
 The first Marine awarded the Medal of Honor ( Navy ) was John F. <unk> on July 10 , 1863 , for his rifle action aboard the USS <unk> on May 15 , 1862 . 
 The only Coast <unk> to be awarded the Medal of Honor ( Navy , posthumous ) was <unk> First Class Douglas Munro on May 27 , 1943 , for evacuating 500 Marines under fire on September 27 , 1942 during the Battle of <unk> . Munro was a Canadian @-@ born , naturalized U.S. citizen . 
 The only woman awarded the Medal of Honor ( Army ) is Mary Edwards Walker , who was a civilian Union Army surgeon during the American Civil War . She received the award in 1865 for the First Battle of Bull Run ( July 21 , 1861 ) and a series of battles to the Battle of Atlanta in <unk> . 1864 ... " for usual medal of honor <unk> services . " 
 The 1917 Medal of Honor Board deleted 911 awards , but only 910 names from the Army Medal of Honor Roll , including awards to Dr. Mary Edwards Walker , William F. " Buffalo Bill " <unk> and the first of two awards issued February 10 , 1887 , to George W. <unk> , who retained his award issued October 25 , 1893 . None of the 910 " deleted " recipients were ordered to return their medals , although on the question of whether the recipients could continue to wear their medals , the Judge <unk> General advised the Medal of Honor Board the Army was not <unk> to police the matter . Walker continued to wear her medal until her death . President Jimmy Carter formally restored her medal posthumously in 1977 . 
 61 Canadians who served in the United States Armed Forces , mostly during the American Civil War . Since 1900 , four Canadians have received the medal . The only Canadian @-@ born , naturalized U.S. citizen to receive the medal for heroism during the Vietnam War was Peter C. Lemon . 
 While the governing statute for the Army Medal of Honor ( 10 U.S.C. § <unk> ) , beginning in 1918 , explicitly stated that a recipient must be " an officer or enlisted man of the Army " , " distinguish himself <unk> by gallantry and <unk> at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty " , and perform an act of <unk> " in action involving actual conflict with an enemy " , exceptions have been made : 
 Charles <unk> , 1927 , civilian pilot , and U.S. Army Air Corps reserve officer . <unk> 's medal was authorized by a special act of Congress that directly contradicted the July 1918 act of Congress that required that all Army recipients be " in action involving actual conflict with an enemy " . The award was based on the previous acts authorizing the Navy medal to <unk> and Bennett ( see above ) . Some <unk> objected to <unk> 's award because it contradicted the 1918 statute , but Representative Snell reportedly <unk> this dissent by explaining that " it was and it wasn 't the Congressional Medal of Honor which <unk> would receive under his bill ; that the <unk> medal would be entirely distinct from the <unk> award for war service . " 
 Major General ( <unk> ) <unk> <unk> was awarded the medal in 1935 , on his <unk> birthday , " for his life of splendid public service " . The result of a special act of Congress similar to <unk> 's , <unk> 's medal citation did not reference any acts of <unk> . 
 Foreign unknown recipients include the British Unknown Warrior , the French Unknown Soldier , the Romanian Unknown Soldier , the Italian Unknown Soldier , and the Belgian Unknown Soldier . 
 U.S. unknown recipients include the <unk> of World War I , World War II , Korea , and Vietnam . The Vietnam Unknown was later identified as Air Force 1st Lt. Michael J. <unk> through the use of DNA identification . <unk> 's family asked for his Medal of Honor , but the Department of Defense denied the request in 1998 . According to <unk> of Defense <unk> de Leon , the medal was awarded symbolically to all Vietnam <unk> , not to <unk> specifically . 
 Nineteen men have been awarded the Medal of Honor twice . The first two @-@ time Medal of Honor recipient was Thomas <unk> ( brother of George Armstrong <unk> ) for two separate actions that took place several days apart during the American Civil War . 
 Five " double recipients " were awarded both the Army and Navy Medal of Honor for the same action ; all five of these occurrences took place during World War I. Since February 1919 , no single individual can be awarded more than one Medal of Honor for the same action , although a member of one branch of the armed forces can receive the Medal of Honor from another branch if the actions for which it was awarded occurred under the authority of the second branch . 
 To date , the maximum number of Medals of Honor earned by any service member has been two . The last individual to be awarded two Medals of Honor was John J. Kelly in 1918 ; the last individual to receive two Medals of Honor for two different actions was <unk> Butler , in 1914 and 1915 . 
 Arthur MacArthur , Jr. and Douglas MacArthur are the first father and son to be awarded the Medal of Honor . The only other such pairing is Theodore Roosevelt ( awarded in 2001 ) and Theodore Roosevelt , Jr . 
 John and William Black , in the American Civil War . The Blacks are the first brothers to be so honored . 
 Charles and Henry <unk> , in the American Civil War , the latter for saving a drowning man while under fire . 
 Antoine and Julien <unk> . The <unk> also have the unique distinction of receiving their medals for actions in separate conflicts , Antoine in the Philippine – American War and Julien when he crossed the border to rescue <unk> and Americans in a Mexican Revolution <unk> . 
 Another notable pair of related recipients are Admiral Frank Friday Fletcher ( rear admiral at the time of award ) and his nephew , Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher ( lieutenant at the time of award ) , both awarded for actions during the United States occupation of Veracruz . 
 Since 1979 , 85 <unk> Medal of Honor decorations were presented to recognize actions from the Civil War to the Vietnam War . In addition , five recipients who names were not included on the Army Medal of Honor Roll in 1917 had their awards restored . 
 A 1993 study commissioned by the U.S. Army investigated " racial <unk> " in the <unk> of medals . At the time , no Medals of Honor had been awarded to American soldiers of African descent who served in World War II . After an <unk> review , the study recommended that ten Distinguished Service Cross recipients be awarded the Medal of Honor . On January 13 , 1997 , President Bill Clinton presented the Medal of Honor to seven of these World War II veterans , six of them posthumously and one to former Second Lieutenant Vernon Baker . 
 In 1998 , a similar study of Asian Americans resulted in President Bill Clinton presenting 22 Medals of Honor in 2000 . Twenty of these medals went to American soldiers of Japanese descent of the <unk> Regimental Combat Team ( <unk> <unk> ) that served in the European Theater of Operations during World War II . One of these Medal of Honor recipients was Senator Daniel <unk> , a former U.S. Army officer in the <unk> <unk> . 
 In 2005 , President George W. Bush presented the Medal of Honor to <unk> Rubin , a Hungarian @-@ born American Jew who was a Holocaust survivor of World War II and enlisted U.S. <unk> and prisoner of war in the Korean War , whom many believed to have been overlooked because of his religion . 
 On April 11 , 2013 , President Obama presented the Medal of Honor posthumously to Army <unk> Captain Emil <unk> for his actions as a prisoner of war during the Korean war . This follows other awards to Army Sergeant Leslie H. Sabo , Jr. for conspicuous gallantry in action on May 10 , 1970 , near Se San , Cambodia , during the Vietnam War and to Army Private First Class Henry <unk> and Army Private First Class Anthony T. <unk> for their heroic actions during the Korean War . 
 As a result of a <unk> mandated review to ensure brave acts were not overlooked due to prejudice or discrimination , on March 18 , 2014 President Obama upgraded Distinguished Service Crosses to Medals of Honor for 24 Hispanic , Jewish , and African American individuals — the " <unk> 24 " — for their actions in World War II , the Korean War and the Vietnam War . Three were still living at the time of the ceremony . 
 During the Civil War , Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton promised a Medal of Honor to every man in the 27th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment who extended his <unk> beyond the agreed @-@ upon date . The Battle of <unk> was imminent , and 311 men of the regiment volunteered to serve until the battle was resolved . The remaining men returned to Maine , but with the Union victory at <unk> the 311 volunteers soon followed . The volunteers arrived back in Maine in time to be discharged with the men who had earlier returned . Since there seemed to be no official list of the 311 volunteers , the War Department exacerbated the situation by <unk> 864 medals to the commanding officer of the regiment . The commanding officer only issued the medals to the volunteers who stayed behind and retained the others on the grounds that , if he returned the remainder to the War Department , the War Department would try to reissue the medals . 
 In 1916 , a board of five Army generals on the retired list convened under act of law to review every Army Medal of Honor awarded . The board was to report on any Medals of Honor awarded or issued for any cause other than distinguished service . The commission , led by Nelson A. Miles , identified 911 awards for causes other than distinguished service . This included the 864 medals awarded to members of the 27th Maine regiment ; 29 servicemen who served as Abraham Lincoln 's funeral guard ; six civilians , including Mary Edwards Walker and Buffalo Bill <unk> ; and 12 others . Walker 's medal was restored by President Jimmy Carter in 1977 . <unk> and four other civilian scouts who rendered distinguished service in action , and who were therefore considered by the board to have fully earned their medals , had theirs restored in 1989 . The report was endorsed by the Judge <unk> General , who also advised that the War Department should not seek the return of the revoked medals from the recipients identified by the board . In the case of recipients who continued to wear the medal , the War Department was advised to take no action to enforce the statute . 
 David <unk> White 's nomination is under consideration for the capture of Confederate Major General G. W. <unk> Lee , eldest son of General Robert E. Lee , at the Battle of Sailors Creek , Virginia , on April 6 , 1865 . 
 The following decorations , in one degree or another , bear similar names to the Medal of Honor , but are entirely separate awards with different criteria for issuance : 
 <unk> Medal of Honor : decoration of the United States Revenue <unk> Service , which was later merged into the United States Coast Guard 
 Congressional Gold Medal : the highest civilian honor bestowed by the United States ( along with the Presidential Medal of Freedom ) 
 Congressional Space Medal of Honor : intended for issuance to astronauts , but despite its name , it is not equal to the Medal of Honor 
 Presidential Medal of Freedom : the highest civilian honor bestowed by the United States ( along with the Congressional Gold Medal ) 
 Several United States law enforcement decorations bear the name " Medal of Honor " . The Public Safety Officer Medal of <unk> , established by Congress in 2001 and stated to be " the highest National award for <unk> by a public safety officer " , is also awarded by the President of the United States . 
 <unk> ( / <unk> / ; singular : <unk> ) constitute a large domain of <unk> microorganisms . Typically a few micrometres in length , bacteria have a number of shapes , ranging from spheres to rods and <unk> . <unk> were among the first life forms to appear on Earth , and are present in most of its habitats . <unk> inhabit soil , water , acidic hot springs , radioactive waste , and the deep portions of Earth 's crust . <unk> also live in symbiotic and parasitic relationships with plants and animals . 
 Most bacteria have not been characterized , and only about half of the bacterial <unk> have species that can be grown in the laboratory . The study of bacteria is known as <unk> , a branch of <unk> . 
 There are approximately ten times as many bacterial cells in the human flora as there are human cells in the body , with the largest number of the human flora being in the gut flora , and a large number on the skin . The vast majority of the bacteria in the body are rendered harmless by the protective effects of the immune system , and some are beneficial . However , several species of bacteria are pathogenic and cause infectious diseases , including cholera , syphilis , anthrax , <unk> , and <unk> plague . The most common fatal bacterial diseases are respiratory infections , with tuberculosis alone killing about 2 million people per year , mostly in sub @-@ Saharan Africa . In developed countries , antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections and are also used in farming , making antibiotic resistance a growing problem . In industry , bacteria are important in sewage treatment and the breakdown of oil spills , the production of cheese and <unk> through fermentation , and the recovery of gold , <unk> , copper and other metals in the mining sector , as well as in <unk> , and the manufacture of antibiotics and other chemicals . 
 Once regarded as plants constituting the class <unk> , bacteria are now classified as prokaryotes . Unlike cells of animals and other eukaryotes , bacterial cells do not contain a nucleus and rarely harbour membrane @-@ bound organelles . Although the term bacteria traditionally included all prokaryotes , the scientific classification changed after the discovery in the 1990s that prokaryotes consist of two very different groups of organisms that evolved from an ancient common ancestor . These evolutionary domains are called <unk> and <unk> . 
 The word bacteria is the plural of the New Latin <unk> , which is the <unk> of the Greek <unk> ( <unk> ) , the <unk> of <unk> ( <unk> ) , meaning " staff , cane " , because the first ones to be discovered were rod @-@ shaped . 
 <unk> display a wide diversity of shapes and sizes , called morphologies . <unk> cells are about one @-@ tenth the size of eukaryotic cells and are typically 0 @.@ 5 – 5 @.@ 0 micrometres in length . However , a few species are visible to the unaided eye — for example , <unk> <unk> is up to half a millimetre long and <unk> <unk> reaches 0 @.@ 7 mm . Among the smallest bacteria are members of the genus <unk> , which measure only 0 @.@ 3 micrometres , as small as the largest viruses . Some bacteria may be even smaller , but these <unk> are not well @-@ studied . 
 Many bacterial species exist simply as single cells , others associate in characteristic patterns : <unk> form <unk> ( pairs ) , <unk> form chains , and <unk> group together in " bunch of grapes " clusters . <unk> can also be elongated to form filaments , for example the <unk> . <unk> bacteria are often surrounded by a sheath that contains many individual cells . Certain types , such as species of the genus <unk> , even form complex , branched filaments , similar in appearance to fungal mycelia . 
 Even more complex morphological changes are sometimes possible . For example , when <unk> of amino acids , <unk> detect surrounding cells in a process known as <unk> sensing , migrate toward each other , and aggregate to form fruiting bodies up to 500 micrometres long and containing approximately 100 @,@ 000 bacterial cells . In these fruiting bodies , the bacteria perform separate tasks ; this type of cooperation is a simple type of multicellular organisation . For example , about one in 10 cells migrate to the top of these fruiting bodies and differentiate into a specialised <unk> state called <unk> , which are more resistant to drying and other adverse environmental conditions than are ordinary cells . 
 The bacterial cell is surrounded by a cell membrane ( also known as a <unk> , <unk> or plasma membrane ) . This membrane encloses the contents of the cell and acts as a barrier to hold nutrients , proteins and other essential components of the cytoplasm within the cell . As they are prokaryotes , bacteria do not usually have membrane @-@ bound organelles in their cytoplasm , and thus contain few large intracellular structures . They lack a true nucleus , mitochondria , <unk> and the other organelles present in eukaryotic cells . <unk> were once seen as simple bags of cytoplasm , but structures such as the <unk> cytoskeleton and the localization of proteins to specific locations within the cytoplasm that give bacteria some complexity have been discovered . These <unk> levels of organization have been called " bacterial <unk> " . 
 <unk> <unk> , such as <unk> , provide a further level of organization ; they are compartments within bacteria that are surrounded by <unk> protein shells , rather than by <unk> membranes . These " <unk> organelles " <unk> and <unk> bacterial metabolism , a function performed by the membrane @-@ bound organelles in eukaryotes . 
 Many important biochemical reactions , such as energy generation , use concentration <unk> across membranes . The general lack of internal membranes in bacteria means reactions such as electron transport occur across the cell membrane between the cytoplasm and the <unk> space . However , in many <unk> bacteria the plasma membrane is highly folded and fills most of the cell with layers of light @-@ gathering membrane . These light @-@ gathering complexes may even form <unk> @-@ enclosed structures called <unk> in green sulfur bacteria . Other proteins import nutrients across the cell membrane , or expel <unk> molecules from the cytoplasm . 
 In most bacteria , a cell wall is present on the outside of the cell membrane . The cell membrane and cell wall comprise the cell envelope . A common bacterial cell wall material is <unk> ( called " <unk> " in older sources ) , which is made from <unk> chains cross @-@ linked by peptides containing D @-@ amino acids . <unk> cell walls are different from the cell walls of plants and fungi , which are made of <unk> and <unk> , respectively . The cell wall of bacteria is also distinct from that of <unk> , which do not contain <unk> . The cell wall is essential to the survival of many bacteria , and the antibiotic <unk> is able to kill bacteria by inhibiting a step in the synthesis of <unk> . 
 There are broadly speaking two different types of cell wall in bacteria , a thick one in the <unk> @-@ <unk> and a thinner one in the <unk> @-@ <unk> . The names originate from the reaction of cells to the <unk> stain , a test long @-@ employed for the classification of bacterial species . 
 <unk> @-@ fast bacteria , such as <unk> , are resistant to <unk> by acids during staining procedures . The high <unk> acid content of <unk> , is responsible for the staining pattern of poor absorption followed by high retention . The most common staining technique used to identify acid @-@ fast bacteria is the <unk> @-@ <unk> stain or acid @-@ fast stain , in which the acid @-@ fast <unk> are stained bright @-@ red and stand out clearly against a blue background . L @-@ form bacteria are strains of bacteria that lack cell walls . The main pathogenic bacteria in this class is <unk> ( not to be confused with <unk> ) . 
 In many bacteria , an S @-@ layer of <unk> <unk> protein molecules covers the outside of the cell . This layer provides chemical and physical protection for the cell surface and can act as a <unk> <unk> barrier . S @-@ layers have diverse but mostly poorly understood functions , but are known to act as <unk> factors in <unk> and contain surface enzymes in <unk> <unk> . 
 <unk> are rigid protein structures , about 20 <unk> in diameter and up to 20 micrometres in length , that are used for <unk> . <unk> are driven by the energy released by the transfer of ions down an <unk> gradient across the cell membrane . 
 <unk> are produced by many bacteria to surround their cells , and vary in structural complexity : ranging from a disorganised <unk> layer of extra @-@ cellular <unk> to a highly structured capsule . These structures can protect cells from <unk> by eukaryotic cells such as macrophages ( part of the human immune system ) . They can also act as <unk> and be involved in cell recognition , as well as aiding attachment to surfaces and the formation of <unk> . 
 The assembly of these extracellular structures is dependent on bacterial secretion systems . These transfer proteins from the cytoplasm into the <unk> or into the environment around the cell . Many types of secretion systems are known and these structures are often essential for the <unk> of pathogens , so are intensively studied . 
 <unk> exhibit an extremely wide variety of metabolic types . The distribution of metabolic traits within a group of bacteria has traditionally been used to define their taxonomy , but these traits often do not correspond with modern genetic classifications . <unk> metabolism is classified into nutritional groups on the basis of three major criteria : the kind of energy used for growth , the source of carbon , and the electron donors used for growth . An additional criterion of respiratory microorganisms are the electron <unk> used for <unk> or <unk> <unk> . 
 Another way of life of <unk> in the absence of possible electron <unk> is fermentation , wherein the electrons taken from the reduced substrates are transferred to <unk> <unk> to generate reduced fermentation products ( e.g. , <unk> , <unk> , hydrogen , <unk> acid ) . <unk> is possible , because the energy content of the substrates is higher than that of the products , which allows the organisms to <unk> ATP and drive their metabolism . 
 These processes are also important in biological responses to pollution ; for example , sulfate @-@ reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury ( <unk> and <unk> ) in the environment . Non @-@ respiratory <unk> use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power , <unk> metabolic by @-@ products ( such as <unk> in <unk> ) as waste . <unk> <unk> can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron <unk> depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves . 
 In addition to fixing carbon dioxide in <unk> , some bacteria also fix nitrogen gas ( nitrogen <unk> ) using the enzyme <unk> . This environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of nearly all the metabolic types listed above , but is not universal . 
 Regardless of the type of metabolic process they employ , the majority of bacteria are able to take in raw materials only in the form of relatively small molecules , which enter the cell by <unk> or through molecular channels in cell membranes . The <unk> are the exception ( as they are in possessing membranes around their nuclear material ) . It has recently been shown that <unk> <unk> is able to take in large molecules via a process that in some ways resembles <unk> , the process used by eukaryotic cells to <unk> external items . 
 Unlike in multicellular organisms , increases in cell size ( cell growth ) and reproduction by cell division are tightly linked in <unk> organisms . <unk> grow to a fixed size and then reproduce through binary fission , a form of <unk> reproduction . Under optimal conditions , bacteria can grow and divide extremely rapidly , and bacterial populations can double as quickly as every 9 @.@ 8 minutes . In cell division , two identical clone daughter cells are produced . Some bacteria , while still <unk> <unk> , form more complex reproductive structures that help disperse the newly formed daughter cells . Examples include fruiting body formation by <unk> and aerial hyphae formation by <unk> , or budding . <unk> involves a cell forming a <unk> that breaks away and produces a daughter cell . 
 In the laboratory , bacteria are usually grown using solid or liquid media . Solid growth media , such as <unk> plates , are used to isolate pure cultures of a bacterial strain . However , liquid growth media are used when measurement of growth or large volumes of cells are required . Growth in stirred liquid media occurs as an even cell suspension , making the cultures easy to divide and transfer , although isolating single bacteria from liquid media is difficult . The use of selective media ( media with specific nutrients added or deficient , or with antibiotics added ) can help identify specific organisms . 
 Most laboratory techniques for growing bacteria use high levels of nutrients to produce large amounts of cells <unk> and quickly . However , in natural environments , nutrients are limited , meaning that bacteria cannot continue to reproduce indefinitely . This nutrient limitation has led the evolution of different growth strategies ( see r / K selection theory ) . Some organisms can grow extremely rapidly when nutrients become available , such as the formation of algal ( and <unk> ) blooms that often occur in lakes during the summer . Other organisms have adaptations to harsh environments , such as the production of multiple antibiotics by <unk> that inhibit the growth of competing microorganisms . In nature , many organisms live in communities ( e.g. , <unk> ) that may allow for increased supply of nutrients and protection from environmental stresses . These relationships can be essential for growth of a particular organism or group of organisms ( <unk> ) . 
 <unk> growth follows four phases . When a population of bacteria first enter a high @-@ nutrient environment that allows growth , the cells need to adapt to their new environment . The first phase of growth is the <unk> phase , a period of slow growth when the cells are adapting to the high @-@ nutrient environment and preparing for fast growth . The <unk> phase has high <unk> rates , as proteins necessary for rapid growth are produced . The second phase of growth is the log phase , also known as the <unk> or exponential phase . The log phase is marked by rapid exponential growth . The rate at which cells grow during this phase is known as the growth rate ( k ) , and the time it takes the cells to double is known as the generation time ( g ) . During log phase , nutrients are <unk> at maximum speed until one of the nutrients is depleted and starts limiting growth . The third phase of growth is the stationary phase and is caused by depleted nutrients . The cells reduce their metabolic activity and consume non @-@ essential cellular proteins . The stationary phase is a transition from rapid growth to a stress response state and there is increased expression of genes involved in DNA repair , <unk> metabolism and nutrient transport . The final phase is the death phase where the bacteria run out of nutrients and die . 
 <unk> may also contain <unk> , which are small extra @-@ chromosomal <unk> that may contain genes for antibiotic resistance or <unk> factors . <unk> replicate independently of chromosomes , so it is possible that <unk> could be lost in bacterial cell division . Against this possibility is the fact that a single <unk> can contain hundreds of copies of a single <unk> . 
 Some bacteria also transfer genetic material between cells . This can occur in three main ways . First , bacteria can take up <unk> DNA from their environment , in a process called transformation . <unk> can also be transferred by the process of transduction , when the integration of a <unk> introduces foreign DNA into the chromosome . The third method of gene transfer is <unk> , whereby DNA is transferred through direct cell contact . 
 <unk> , unlike transduction or <unk> , depends on numerous bacterial gene products that specifically interact to perform this complex process , and thus transformation is clearly a bacterial adaptation for DNA transfer . In order for a <unk> to bind , take up and <unk> donor DNA into its own chromosome , it must first enter a special physiological state termed competence ( see Natural competence ) . In <unk> <unk> , about 40 genes are required for the development of competence . The length of DNA transferred during B. <unk> transformation can be between a third of a chromosome up to the whole chromosome . <unk> appears to be common among bacterial species , and thus far at least 60 species are known to have the natural ability to become competent for transformation . The development of competence in nature is usually associated with <unk> environmental conditions , and seems to be an adaptation for facilitating repair of DNA damage in recipient cells . 
 In ordinary circumstances , transduction , <unk> , and transformation involve transfer of DNA between individual bacteria of the same species , but occasionally transfer may occur between individuals of different bacterial species and this may have significant consequences , such as the transfer of antibiotic resistance . In such cases , gene acquisition from other bacteria or the environment is called horizontal gene transfer and may be common under natural conditions . Gene transfer is particularly important in antibiotic resistance as it allows the rapid transfer of resistance genes between different pathogens . 
 <unk> frequently <unk> chemicals into their environment in order to modify it favorably . The <unk> are often proteins and may act as enzymes that digest some form of food in the environment . 
 A few bacteria have chemical systems that generate light . This <unk> often occurs in bacteria that live in association with fish , and the light probably serves to attract fish or other large animals . 
 <unk> often function as multicellular <unk> known as <unk> , exchanging a variety of molecular signals for inter @-@ cell communication , and engaging in coordinated multicellular behavior . 
 The communal benefits of multicellular cooperation include a cellular division of labor , accessing resources that cannot effectively be utilized by single cells , collectively defending against antagonists , and <unk> population survival by <unk> into distinct cell types . For example , bacteria in <unk> can have more than 500 times increased resistance to <unk> agents than individual " <unk> " bacteria of the same species . 
 One type of inter @-@ cellular communication by a molecular signal is called <unk> sensing , which serves the purpose of determining whether there is a local population density that is sufficiently high that it is productive to invest in processes that are only successful if large numbers of similar organisms behave similarly , as in <unk> digestive enzymes or emitting light . 
 <unk> sensing allows bacteria to coordinate gene expression , and enables them to produce , release and detect <unk> or <unk> which accumulate with the growth in cell population . 
 Many bacteria can move using a variety of mechanisms : <unk> are used for swimming through fluids ; bacterial gliding and twitching <unk> move bacteria across surfaces ; and changes of <unk> allow vertical motion . 
 <unk> bacteria frequently move near 10 body lengths per second and a few as fast as 100 . This makes them at least as fast as fish , on a relative scale . 
 In bacterial gliding and twitching <unk> , bacteria use their type IV <unk> as a grappling hook , repeatedly extending it , anchoring it and then <unk> it with remarkable force ( > 80 <unk> ) . 
 " Our observations redefine twitching <unk> as a rapid , highly organized mechanism of bacterial translocation by which <unk> <unk> can disperse itself over large areas to <unk> new territories . It is also now clear , both <unk> and genetically , that twitching <unk> and social gliding <unk> , such as occurs in <unk> <unk> , are essentially the same process . " 
 <unk> are semi @-@ rigid cylindrical structures that are rotated and function much like the propeller on a ship . <unk> as small as bacteria operate a low Reynolds number and cylindrical forms are more efficient than the flat , <unk> @-@ like , forms appropriate at human @-@ size scale . 
 Many bacteria ( such as E. coli ) have two distinct modes of movement : forward movement ( swimming ) and tumbling . The tumbling allows them to <unk> and makes their movement a three @-@ dimensional random walk . ( See external links below for link to videos . ) The <unk> of a unique group of bacteria , the <unk> , are found between two membranes in the <unk> space . They have a distinctive helical body that twists about as it moves . 
 <unk> bacteria are attracted or repelled by certain <unk> in behaviors called taxes : these include <unk> , <unk> , energy taxis , and <unk> . In one peculiar group , the <unk> , individual bacteria move together to form waves of cells that then differentiate to form fruiting bodies containing spores . The <unk> move only when on solid surfaces , unlike E. coli , which is <unk> in liquid or solid media . 
 Several <unk> and <unk> species move inside host cells by <unk> the cytoskeleton , which is normally used to move organelles inside the cell . By promoting actin <unk> at one pole of their cells , they can form a kind of tail that pushes them through the host cell 's cytoplasm . 
 The identification of bacteria in the laboratory is particularly relevant in medicine , where the correct treatment is determined by the bacterial species causing an infection . Consequently , the need to identify human pathogens was a major <unk> for the development of techniques to identify bacteria . 
 Culture techniques are designed to promote the growth and identify particular bacteria , while <unk> the growth of the other bacteria in the sample . Often these techniques are designed for specific specimens ; for example , a <unk> sample will be treated to identify organisms that cause pneumonia , while stool specimens are cultured on selective media to identify organisms that cause <unk> , while preventing growth of non @-@ pathogenic bacteria . Specimens that are normally sterile , such as blood , urine or spinal fluid , are cultured under conditions designed to grow all possible organisms . Once a pathogenic organism has been isolated , it can be further characterised by its morphology , growth patterns ( such as <unk> or <unk> growth ) , patterns of <unk> , and staining . 
 As with bacterial classification , identification of bacteria is increasingly using molecular methods . <unk> using DNA @-@ based tools , such as polymerase chain reaction , are increasingly popular due to their <unk> and speed , compared to culture @-@ based methods . These methods also allow the detection and identification of " viable but <unk> " cells that are <unk> active but non @-@ dividing . However , even using these improved methods , the total number of bacterial species is not known and cannot even be estimated with any certainty . Following present classification , there are a little less than 9 @,@ 300 known species of prokaryotes , which includes bacteria and archaea ; but attempts to estimate the true number of bacterial diversity have ranged from 107 to 109 total species – and even these diverse estimates may be off by many orders of magnitude . 
 Despite their apparent simplicity , bacteria can form complex associations with other organisms . These symbiotic associations can be divided into <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . Due to their small size , <unk> bacteria are ubiquitous and grow on animals and plants exactly as they will grow on any other surface . However , their growth can be increased by warmth and <unk> , and large populations of these organisms in humans are the cause of body odor . 
 Some species of bacteria kill and then consume other microorganisms , these species are called predatory bacteria . These include organisms such as <unk> <unk> , which forms <unk> of cells that kill and digest any bacteria they encounter . Other bacterial predators either attach to their prey in order to digest them and absorb nutrients , such as <unk> <unk> , or invade another cell and <unk> inside the <unk> , such as <unk> . These predatory bacteria are thought to have evolved from <unk> that consumed dead microorganisms , through adaptations that allowed them to <unk> and kill other organisms . 
 Certain bacteria form close spatial associations that are essential for their survival . One such mutualistic association , called <unk> hydrogen transfer , occurs between clusters of <unk> bacteria that consume organic acids , such as <unk> acid or <unk> acid , and produce hydrogen , and <unk> <unk> that consume hydrogen . The bacteria in this association are unable to consume the organic acids as this reaction produces hydrogen that <unk> in their surroundings . Only the intimate association with the hydrogen @-@ consuming <unk> keeps the hydrogen concentration low enough to allow the bacteria to grow . 
 <unk> , often <unk> acid bacteria , such as <unk> and <unk> , in combination with <unk> and molds , have been used for thousands of years in the preparation of <unk> foods , such as cheese , <unk> , <unk> sauce , <unk> , vinegar , wine and <unk> . 
 Because of their ability to quickly grow and the relative ease with which they can be manipulated , bacteria are the <unk> for the fields of molecular biology , genetics and <unk> . By making mutations in bacterial DNA and examining the resulting <unk> , scientists can determine the function of genes , enzymes and metabolic pathways in bacteria , then apply this knowledge to more complex organisms . This aim of understanding the <unk> of a cell reaches its most complex expression in the synthesis of huge amounts of enzyme <unk> and gene expression data into mathematical models of entire organisms . This is <unk> in some well @-@ studied bacteria , with models of <unk> coli metabolism now being produced and tested . This understanding of bacterial metabolism and genetics allows the use of <unk> to <unk> bacteria for the production of therapeutic proteins , such as insulin , growth factors , or antibodies . 
 Because of their importance for research in general , samples of bacterial strains are isolated and preserved in Biological <unk> Centers . This ensures the availability of the strain to scientists worldwide . 
 <unk> were first observed by the Dutch <unk> <unk> van <unk> in 1676 , using a single @-@ lens microscope of his own design . He then published his observations in a series of letters to the Royal Society of London . <unk> were <unk> 's most remarkable microscopic discovery . They were just at the limit of what his simple lenses could make out and , in one of the most striking <unk> in the history of science , no one else would see them again for over a century . Only then were his by @-@ then @-@ largely @-@ forgotten observations of bacteria — as opposed to his famous " <unk> " ( <unk> ) — taken seriously . 
 Christian Gottfried <unk> introduced the word " <unk> " in 1828 . In fact , his <unk> was a genus that contained non @-@ spore @-@ forming rod @-@ shaped bacteria , as opposed to <unk> , a genus of spore @-@ forming rod @-@ shaped bacteria defined by <unk> in 1835 . 
 Louis <unk> demonstrated in 1859 that the growth of microorganisms causes the fermentation process , and that this growth is not due to spontaneous generation . ( <unk> and molds , commonly associated with fermentation , are not bacteria , but rather fungi . ) Along with his contemporary Robert Koch , <unk> was an early advocate of the <unk> theory of disease . 
 Robert Koch , a pioneer in medical <unk> , worked on cholera , anthrax and tuberculosis . In his research into tuberculosis Koch finally proved the <unk> theory , for which he received a Nobel Prize in 1905 . In Koch 's <unk> , he set out criteria to test if an organism is the cause of a disease , and these <unk> are still used today . 
 Though it was known in the nineteenth century that bacteria are the cause of many diseases , no effective <unk> treatments were available . In 1910 , Paul Ehrlich developed the first antibiotic , by changing <unk> that selectively stained <unk> <unk> — the <unk> that causes syphilis — into compounds that selectively killed the <unk> . Ehrlich had been awarded a 1908 Nobel Prize for his work on <unk> , and pioneered the use of stains to detect and identify bacteria , with his work being the basis of the <unk> stain and the <unk> – <unk> stain . 
 A major step forward in the study of bacteria came in 1977 when Carl <unk> recognized that archaea have a separate line of evolutionary descent from bacteria . This new phylogenetic taxonomy depended on the sequencing of <unk> ribosomal RNA , and divided prokaryotes into two evolutionary domains , as part of the three @-@ domain system . 
 Janet Jackson is the self @-@ titled debut album by American recording artist Janet Jackson . It was released on September 21 , 1982 , by A & M Records . Jackson 's career as a recording artist was established by her father and manager Joseph Jackson , who arranged her recording contract with her recording company . Prior to her rise to fame , the singer had no interest in pursuing a musical career . Despite this , she was motivated to pursue a career in entertainment , and considered the idea after recording herself in the studio . After acting in the variety show The Jacksons , she began starring in several TV series and commenced recording her debut album . Its artwork depicts Jackson submerged in a swimming pool . 
 Janet Jackson is described as a post @-@ disco and R & B record . Songwriters Angela <unk> and René Moore contributed to much of the album 's lyrics . Moore and <unk> share production credits with Foster <unk> , Jerry Weaver , and Bobby Watson . Janet Jackson received mixed reviews from music critics who found its content bland , although highlighted some tracks . It also managed to chart on the Billboard 200 and in New Zealand . Three singles from the album had little impact on Billboard charts , among them " Young Love " , " Come Give Your Love to Me " and " Say You Do " . In order to promote Janet Jackson , she performed the song on American TV shows American <unk> and Soul Train in 1982 . 
 Jackson had initially desired to become a horse racing jockey or entertainment lawyer , with plans to support herself through acting . Despite this , she was anticipated to pursue a career in entertainment , and considered the idea after recording herself in the studio . At age seven , Jackson performed at the Las Vegas Strip at the MGM Casino and began acting in the variety show The Jacksons in 1976 . The year after , she was selected to have a starring role as Penny Gordon Woods in the sitcom Good Times . She later starred in A New Kind of Family before joining the cast of <unk> <unk> <unk> , portraying <unk> <unk> for two years . Jackson also played the recurring role of <unk> Hewitt during the fourth season of Fame , but expressed indifference towards the series . When Jackson was sixteen , she was arranged a contract with A & M Records and began recording her debut album with the assistance of her father , working with a number of songwriters and producers such as René Moore , Angela <unk> and Bobby Watson . 
 The album 's artwork was photographed by Harry <unk> in the swimming pool of the Jackson family 's home . Jackson described <unk> as " the sweetest man <unk> " . She took inspiration from a photograph of actress Elizabeth Taylor submerged in a swimming pool which was taken early in her career . In the photograph , nothing could be seen apart from Taylor 's face above the water ; her body was hidden beneath the surface . Jackson thought the pose was dramatic and loved the fact that she could do the same thing , and not to have to reveal anything except for her face . With the photographer , his assistant and other people around the pool , she was still reluctant to take off her robe , and stand there in her bathing suit . She waited until everybody got distracted to slip into the pool . After they took the photos , she waited until everybody was gone to get out of the pool . 
 Five singles were released from the album . " Young Love " was the first . It received little notoriety on the principal singles chart , the Billboard Hot 100 ; it was able to reach a peak of number 64 . However , on the Hot R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Songs , the single managed to reach number six . In New Zealand , " Young Love " reached a peak of number 16 . The second single from Janet Jackson was " Come Give Your Love to Me " and peaked at number 58 on the Hot 100 . It became her last single to appear on that chart until 1986 , when she released Control . The follow @-@ up single , " Say You Do " , only managed to appear on the Hot R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Songs and the Hot Dance Club Songs charts , peaking at numbers 15 and 11 , respectively . The last singles from the album , " Love and My Best Friend " and " Don 't <unk> Up A Good Thing " did not appear on any chart worldwide . In order to further promote Janet Jackson , she performed " Young Love " and " Say You Do " on American TV shows American <unk> and Soul Train in 1982 . 
 Janet Jackson received mixed reviews from music critics . The Baltimore Afro @-@ American gave it a favorable review , commenting that " the eight songs simply feature the poised voice of a dynamic individual . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave it two out of five stars , providing a mixed review saying " On her eponymous debut album , Janet Jackson demonstrates no distinctive musical personality of her own . If her producers had <unk> a sharper set of songs and more interesting beats , Janet Jackson might have been a pleasant set of sunny dance @-@ pop " , highlighting " Young Love " as the only song which " stands out among the undistinguished , sub @-@ disco <unk> and <unk> ballads " . <unk> Carpenter from the same website called Janet Jackson a " debut album of youth @-@ oriented pop " . 
 Similarly , Wilson & <unk> 's Record Reviews commented that " Listening to Jackson 's <unk> , personality @-@ challenged voice on this disc , you 'd never dream what a commercial <unk> she would become " . On its first side , they deemed " You 'll Never Find ( A Love Like Mine ) " and " Young Love " as the <unk> , but criticized the ballad " Love And My Best Friend " , saying it is nearly <unk> . He considered the second side 's sound " up @-@ to @-@ the @-@ minute " , but said " Unfortunately , [ the producer 's ] taste in tunes is <unk> " . The The Rolling Stone Album Guide book stated that the album and its follow @-@ up Dream Street ( 1984 ) sound like bland dance @-@ music ready @-@ <unk> . 
 On the US Billboard 200 , Janet Jackson had its peak at number 63 . In New Zealand , the album peaked at number 44 on the New Zealand Albums Chart , during its only @-@ week chart on April 17 , 1983 . As of 2003 , Janet Jackson sold 82 @,@ 000 copies through BMG Music Club in the United States . And sold additional 62 @,@ 000 copies according to Soundscan . Worldwide , the album has sold 300 @,@ 000 copies , considered a failure at the time . 
 Fanny <unk> <unk> ( January 8 , 1859 – January 22 , 1925 ) was an American geographer , <unk> , explorer , travel writer , and <unk> , notably in the Himalayas . She was one of the first female professional <unk> ; she not only explored but also wrote about her adventures . She set several women 's altitude records , published eight travel books with her husband , and championed women 's rights and women 's suffrage . 
 Born to a wealthy family , <unk> was educated in the finest schools available to women and traveled in Europe . Her marriage to William Hunter <unk> cemented these advantages , and , after being introduced to climbing in New Hampshire , Fanny <unk> traveled the world with him . They were able to capitalize on their wealth and connections to voyage around Europe , North Africa , and Asia . The couple had two children , but Fanny <unk> was not a <unk> type ; they left their children in schools and with nurses , and <unk> saw herself as a New Woman who could equal any man . The <unk> began their travels with bicycle tours of Switzerland , France , Italy , Spain , Algeria and India . They <unk> thousands of miles , sleeping wherever they could find shelter . They wrote books about each trip and Fanny frequently commented on the state of the lives of women that she saw . Their early bicycle tour narratives were better received than their <unk> books . 
 At the end of their cycling trip through India , the couple escaped to the Western <unk> and the <unk> for the summer months , where they were introduced to high @-@ altitude climbing . They returned to this then @-@ <unk> region eight times over the next 14 years . Despite not having modern climbing equipment , the <unk> explored several glaciers and reached the summit of several mountains , eventually reaching 23 @,@ 000 feet ( 7 @,@ 000 m ) on <unk> Peak , a women 's altitude record at the time . They organized <unk> expeditions but struggled to remain on good terms with the local labor force . Coming from a position of American privilege and wealth , they failed to understand the position of the native workers and had difficulty finding and negotiating for reliable porters . 
 After their trips to the <unk> , the <unk> gave lectures about their travels . They were invited to learned societies ; Fanny <unk> became the first American woman to lecture at the <unk> and the second to speak at the Royal Geographical Society . She received many medals of honor from European climbing and geographical societies and was recognized as one of the foremost <unk> of her day . She demonstrated that a woman could climb in high altitudes just as well as a man and helped break down the gender barrier in <unk> . 
 In 1879 , Fanny returned to the United States and on June 16 , 1882 married William Hunter <unk> , a man 12 years her senior . He was also from a wealthy and educated family , having attended Yale and having received his medical training at Harvard . In 1884 they had a daughter , Rachel . 
 William introduced Fanny to climbing after their marriage , and together they spent many summers in the White Mountains in New Hampshire ; here she <unk> Mount Washington ( 6 @,@ 293 feet or 1 @,@ 918 metres ) several times . <unk> in the Northeastern United States allowed Fanny to develop her abilities together with other women . Unlike European clubs , American climbing clubs in the White Mountains allowed women to be members and encouraged women to climb . They promoted a new vision of the American woman , one who was both domestic and athletic , and <unk> took to this image with enthusiasm . By 1886 , women sometimes outnumbered men on hiking expeditions in New England . In her paper on the gender dynamics of climbing in the region , Jenny Ernie @-@ <unk> states that this formative experience shaped <unk> 's commitment to women 's rights , pointing out that " no other well @-@ known international <unk> of the time , male or female , spoke as openly and <unk> about women 's rights " . However , both of the <unk> disliked the provincial nature of life in Worcester , where they resided , and <unk> to live in Europe . After both Fanny 's and William 's fathers died , leaving them enormous estates , the couple embarked on their first major European trip , a tour of Scandinavia and Germany . 
 Together , the <unk> explored the world and co @-@ wrote eight travel books , which describe the people , art , and architecture of the areas in which they journeyed . The <unk> were aware of their contribution to the genre of travel writing as they commented on other writers in their own works . Their <unk> narratives said little about the culture of those remote and sparsely inhabited regions ; they included both lyrical descriptions of the sunset , for example , for their popular audience and detailed explanations of geographical features , such as glaciers , for their scientific readership . Fanny and William added scientific elements to their writings to appeal to authoritative organizations such as the Royal Geographical Society ; Fanny also believed the science would make her more legitimate in the eyes of the climbing community , but it cost her readers . In general , their <unk> tour narratives were better received than those about their <unk> exploits . Fanny wrote the majority of these travel books herself , and in them she commented extensively on the plight of women wherever she traveled . 
 Stephanie <unk> writes , in her <unk> entry on <unk> 's travel writing , that there is an implied feminist criticism of the <unk> women experienced and the inferior status of the women in the societies she encountered . As a strong @-@ willed , outspoken supporter of women 's rights , <unk> used their travels to demonstrate her own abilities and to highlight the <unk> other women lived under . However , their travel books are written in the first @-@ person plural or third @-@ person singular , so it is difficult to decisively attribute views or voices to either William or Fanny . The <unk> ' works are <unk> in that they describe the people they meet and observe as " exotic or unusual , at worst as primitive or even <unk> " . However , at times they make it clear that the people they encounter see them in a similar light , demonstrating that they were sometimes aware of their own biases . 
 After travelling to the <unk> the first time , the <unk> became <unk> with climbing and <unk> . Over a span of 14 years , they traveled eight times to the area , which at the time was almost completely <unk> and <unk> . Their trips were made without the benefit of modern lightweight equipment , freeze @-@ dried foods , <unk> , or radios . On each expedition , they explored , surveyed , and photographed , ultimately reporting on their findings and creating maps . The couple shared and alternated responsibilities ; one year Fanny would organize the logistics of their journey and William would work on the scientific projects and the next year they would reverse roles . 
 As soon as she was able , Fanny <unk> published accounts of her feats , such as an article in the Scottish Geographical Magazine . Writing about this trip at length in In the Ice World of the Himalayas , Fanny made efforts to include scientific information and experiments , <unk> her own modified barometer as superior , but scholarly critics were unimpressed and pointed out her lack of scientific knowledge . Popular reviewers , on the other hand , enjoyed the book , with one concluding , " We have no <unk> in saying that Dr. and Mrs. <unk> have written one of the most remarkable books of travel of recent years . " 
 After returning from their travels , the <unk> <unk> all over Europe . Fanny <unk> in English , German , or French , as the occasion required . At one talk in Lyon , France , 1000 people crowded into the auditorium and 700 were turned away . In 1905 Fanny became the second woman to address the Royal Geographical Society . ( Isabella Bird Bishop had been the first in May 1897 . ) Her talk was mentioned in The Times . 
 She concentrated her attention on the end in view , often <unk> the difficulties and even the dangers that might lie in the way of accomplishment . She went forward with a determination to succeed and a courage that won success where a less determined effort would have failed . She believed in taking advantage of every opportunity . She was no <unk> , and was never the first to suggest turning back in the face of <unk> circumstances . 
 The map the <unk> made during this trip was of low quality . According to Mason , the couple did not have a good sense of <unk> direction , which meant that their measurements were inaccurate and unusable by the Survey of India . 
 Fanny <unk> fell ill in 1917 and died after a long illness in 1925 in Cannes , France . Her ashes were buried in Massachusetts , and are now <unk> along with her husband 's , under a monument in Worcester Massachusetts ' Rural Cemetery that reads " Pioneer <unk> <unk> " . In her will , she left $ 125 @,@ 000 to four colleges , <unk> , <unk> , Smith , and <unk> <unk> ; the <unk> were <unk> of her long @-@ lasting interest in the advancement of women 's rights , and her belief that women were the equals of men . 
 Along with Annie Smith Peck , <unk> was recognized during the early 20th century as one of the most famous female <unk> in the world . Their rivalry demonstrated that women could climb the most remote and difficult terrain on the planet , and achieve the same accomplishments as male <unk> . It was not until Peck and <unk> 's feats that women had been involved in <unk> , though they had climbed regularly in the <unk> since the 1850s . In the <unk> , in particular , <unk> had been dominated by wealthy Englishmen . No other women , however , climbed in the <unk> until well after World War I , by which time improvements in equipment and organization had reduced the risk and the difficulty of the expeditions . 
 As a result of the money <unk> left in her will , <unk> College offers a $ 16 @,@ 000 <unk> named after Fanny <unk> for graduate study in any discipline to a <unk> graduate each year . <unk> <unk> established a Fanny <unk> <unk> Traveling Fellowship , which is awarded to <unk> candidates in Archaeology or Art History when funds permit .

 The Grammy Award for Video of the Year was an honor presented to recording artists at the 24th Grammy Awards in 1982 and the 25th Grammy Awards in 1983 for music videos . The Grammy Awards , an annual ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the <unk> Awards , are presented by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to " honor artistic achievement , technical <unk> and overall excellence in the recording industry , without regard to album sales or chart position " . 
 First presented in 1982 to Michael <unk> for Elephant Parts , the award was reserved for quality " video <unk> or discs in any format created specifically for the home video market " . In 1983 , Olivia Newton @-@ John was presented the award for Olivia Physical . Beginning with the 1984 Grammy Awards , the Video of the Year award category was replaced with the categories Best Video , Short Form and Best Video Album ( now known as Best Music Video and Best Music Film , respectively ) . 
 The award went to <unk> , who is known for creating one of the first companies to distribute television programs and films on home video , and for establishing the television music video format that eventually became MTV . In 1976 , <unk> produced a video for his song " Rio " , and later incorporated it into the " montage of music and gags " called Elephant Parts after starting the company Pacific Arts Video Records . In 1985 , Elephant Parts was adapted into a seven @-@ episode summer series on NBC titled Michael <unk> in Television Parts . 
 The Video of the Year category was discontinued with the establishment of the MTV Video Music Awards in 1984 , whose top award is also presented for Video of the Year . The Academy replaced the category with awards for Best Video , Short Form and Best Video Album beginning with the 26th Grammy Awards . For the awards held in 1988 and 1989 , the criteria changed and honors were presented for the categories Best Concept Music Video and Best Performance Music Video . The Academy returned to the previous format in 1990 , though the two categories were renamed Best Long Form Music Video ( changed to Best Music Film in 2014 ) and Best Short Form Music Video ( shortened to Best Music Video in 2014 ) respectively . 
 " All of Creation " is a song by Christian rock band <unk> . The song , written by <unk> , Brown <unk> , and Dan <unk> , lyrically revolves around the themes of love , life , and belief , as well as the foundation of Christian faith . The song was intended to refer to the birth , death , and resurrection of Jesus in each verse and has been described as ' pop ' and ' worship ' . 
 Released to radio on January 29 , 2010 as the lead single from <unk> 's 2010 album The <unk> Mr. <unk> , " All of Creation " attained considerable success on Christian radio . The single spent ten weeks atop Billboard magazine 's Hot Christian Songs chart and eleven weeks atop the Christian AC <unk> chart , and peaked at No. 1 on the Soft AC / <unk> chart . The song also peaked inside the top ten on the Christian CHR chart , No. 2 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart , and at No. 14 on the Heatseekers Songs chart . The song was ranked at the top spot on Billboard magazine 's 2010 year @-@ end Hot Christian Songs and Hot Christian AC charts , as well as at No. 16 on the year @-@ end Christian Digital Songs chart and No. 23 on the year @-@ end Christian CHR chart . " All of Creation " was nominated for " Song of the Year " and " Pop / Contemporary Recorded Song of the Year " at the 42nd GMA Dove Awards , and was nominated for " Christian Song of the Year " at the 2011 Billboard Music Awards . 
 In an interview with Kevin Davis of New Release Tuesday , lead singer Bart <unk> said the idea behind the song was related to the theme of the album The <unk> Mr. <unk> . <unk> stated , " The entire album deals with three main aspects of love . The theme of the record is to ' love well ' as Jesus commands us in the greatest commandment . There are songs about inward love such as in our song ' Beautiful . ' There are songs based on ' we love because He first loved us , ' which is the basis of this first single , ' All of Creation ' . " <unk> also said , " I set out to write a song that was confessional and refers to the birth , death and resurrection of Jesus in each verse . It was my intent to mention every stage of Christ ’ s <unk> and <unk> sacrifice throughout the song . " 
 " All of Creation " is a Christian rock song with a length of 3 minutes and 56 seconds . It is set in common time and the key of B ♭ major with a steady rock tempo of 104 beats per minute . The song has also been described as ' pop ' and ' worship ' . 
 <unk> themes in the song include love , life , and belief . Lead singer Bart <unk> intended the song to refer to the birth , death , and resurrection of Jesus in each verse . Guitarist Mike <unk> said the song is " a picture of the change we want to see in our own lives . Without love like this , everything we do , everything we are , is in vain . " 
 <unk> also noted , " Not a lot of songs mention the foundation of what we believe in . The whole idea that Christ was born of a virgin , he died on the cross , he rose again . Just the basic principles of Christianity " . He also commented that " the song kind of takes us there , I say ' kind of ' because the first line used to be talking about until a child was born , but it was instantly a Christmas song ... but it does , the first verse goes through talking about how we were completely separated until the cross , basically . " Regarding the chorus of the song , <unk> said " the whole idea of the chorus and the sense that it brings in , with the tons of voices singing , is the fact that there 's a day <unk> going to come when we are going to worship and be as one . " 
 " All of Creation " was officially released to radio on January 29 , 2010 and as a digital single on March 2 , 2010 . The song also had a limited CD single release at select <unk> locations . 
 Critical reception to " All of Creation " was mixed to positive . While Kevin Davis of <unk> called the song " ( a ) worship chorus written for the church in the style of ' You Reign ' or ' God With Us ' " and Kevin <unk> of New Release Tuesday called the song " amazing " , Roger Gelwicks of Jesus Freak <unk> , while noting that " it 's not a bad song by any means " , stated that " ( it ) sounds precisely like the successful singles that have made <unk> famous ... there 's nothing new that 's offered that hasn 't been heard before from the band " . 
 " All of Creation " debuted at No. 31 for the chart week of February 13 , 2010 on the Billboard Hot Christian Songs chart . It advanced to No. 21 in its second chart week , and to No. 10 in its third week . The song advanced to No. 3 in its seventh chart week , and to No. 2 in its ninth chart week . In its tenth chart week , " All of Creation " advanced to No. 1 , a position it held for ten consecutive weeks . The song dropped to No. 2 in its nineteenth chart week , and held that spot for an additional week before dropping to No. 3 .

 The assassination of Robert Francis " Bobby " Kennedy , a United States Senator and brother of assassinated President John Fitzgerald " Jack " Kennedy , took place shortly after midnight on June 5 , 1968 , in Los Angeles , California , during the campaign season for the 1968 presidential election . 
 After winning the California and South Dakota primary elections for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States , Kennedy was fatally shot as he walked through the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel and died in the Good <unk> Hospital twenty @-@ six hours later . <unk> Sirhan , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Palestinian / <unk> immigrant , was convicted of Kennedy 's murder and is serving a life sentence for the crime . The shooting was recorded on audio tape by a freelance newspaper reporter , and the aftermath was captured on film . 
 Kennedy 's body lay in <unk> at St. Patrick 's Cathedral in New York for two days before a funeral Mass was held on June 8 . His body was interred near his brother John at <unk> National Cemetery . His death prompted the protection of presidential candidates by the United States Secret Service . Hubert Humphrey later went on to win the Democratic nomination for the presidency , but ultimately lost the election to Republican Richard Nixon . 
 As with his brother John 's death , Kennedy 's assassination and the circumstances surrounding it have spawned a variety of conspiracy theories . Kennedy remains one of only two sitting United States Senators to be assassinated , the other being Huey Long . 
 Kennedy visited the British Mandate of Palestine in 1948 and wrote dispatches at the time for the Boston Post about his trip and the effect it had on him when he was twenty @-@ two years old . During his stay , he wrote that he grew to admire the Jewish inhabitants of the area . As a Senator , he later became a strong supporter and advocate for Israel . 
 Kennedy was United States Attorney General from January 1961 until September 3 , 1964 , when he resigned to run for election to the United States Senate . He took office as Senator from New York on January 3 , 1965 . 
 The run up to the 1968 presidential election saw the incumbent president , Lyndon B. Johnson , serving during a period of social unrest . There were riots in the major cities despite Johnson 's attempts to introduce anti @-@ poverty and anti @-@ discrimination legislation , and there was significant opposition to the ongoing military action in Vietnam . 
 The assassination of Martin Luther King , Jr. on April 4 , 1968 led to further riots across the US . Kennedy entered the race for the Democratic Party 's nomination for president on March 16 , 1968 — four days after Senator Eugene McCarthy received a large percentage of the vote in the New Hampshire primary against the incumbent President ( 42 % to Johnson 's 49 % ) . Two weeks later , a <unk> Johnson announced he was no longer seeking re @-@ election . One month later , Vice President Hubert Humphrey announced he would seek the presidency . Humphrey did not participate in any primaries but he did obtain the support of many Democratic Party delegates . Following the California primary , Kennedy was in second place with 393 delegates compared to Humphrey 's <unk> and McCarthy ’ s 258 . 
 The 1968 presidential primary elections in California were held on Tuesday , June 4 . The <unk> results gave Kennedy 46 % and McCarthy 42 % . Four hours after the polls closed in California , Kennedy claimed victory in the state 's Democratic presidential primary . He spoke by phone with South Dakota Senator George <unk> . At approximately 12 : 10 a.m. PDT on June 5 , he addressed his campaign supporters in the Ambassador Hotel 's Embassy Room ballroom , in the Mid @-@ <unk> district of Los Angeles . At the time , the government provided Secret Service protection for incumbent presidents but not for presidential candidates . Kennedy 's only security was provided by former FBI agent William Barry and two unofficial <unk> , former professional athletes . During the campaign , Kennedy had welcomed contact with the public , and people had often tried to touch him in their excitement . 
 Kennedy had planned to walk through the ballroom when he had finished speaking , on his way to another gathering of supporters elsewhere in the hotel . However , with deadlines fast approaching , reporters wanted a press conference . Campaign aide Fred <unk> decided that Kennedy would <unk> the second gathering and instead go through the hotel 's kitchen and <unk> area behind the ballroom to the press area . Kennedy finished speaking and started to exit when William Barry stopped him and said , " No , it 's been changed . We 're going this way . " Barry and <unk> began clearing a way for Kennedy to go left through swinging doors to the kitchen corridor , but Kennedy , <unk> in by the crowd , followed <unk> d <unk> Karl <unk> through a back exit . 
 <unk> led Kennedy through the kitchen area , holding Kennedy 's right wrist but frequently releasing it as Kennedy shook hands with those he encountered . <unk> and Kennedy started down a <unk> narrowed by an ice machine against the right wall and a steam table to the left . Kennedy turned to his left and shook hands with <unk> Juan Romero just as <unk> Sirhan stepped down from a low <unk> @-@ <unk> beside the ice machine , rushed past <unk> , and repeatedly fired what was later identified as a <unk> caliber <unk> @-@ Johnson Cadet revolver . 
 After a minute , <unk> wrestled free and grabbed the revolver again , but he had already fired all the bullets and was subdued . Barry went to Kennedy and laid his jacket under the candidate 's head , later recalling : " I knew immediately it was a <unk> , a small caliber , so I hoped it wouldn 't be so bad , but then I saw the hole in the Senator 's head , and I knew " . <unk> and photographers rushed into the area from both directions , contributing to the confusion and chaos . As Kennedy lay wounded , Juan Romero <unk> the senator 's head and placed a rosary in his hand . Kennedy asked Romero , " Is everybody OK ? " and Romero responded , " Yes , everybody 's OK . " Kennedy then turned away from Romero and said , " Everything 's going to be OK . " <unk> by Life photographer Bill <unk> and Boris <unk> of the Los Angeles Times , this moment became the iconic image of the assassination . There was some initial confusion in who was shot , one witness believing that the primary victim was Kennedy 's campaign manager , Stephen Edward Smith . This was quickly realized to be <unk> . 
 Kennedy 's wife <unk> stood outside the crush of people at the scene , seeking help . She was soon led to her husband and <unk> beside him . He turned his head and seemed to recognize her . Smith promptly appeared on television and calmly asked for a doctor . After several minutes , medical attendants arrived and lifted Kennedy onto a stretcher , prompting him to <unk> , " Don 't lift me ... " which were to become his last words . He lost consciousness shortly thereafter . Kennedy was taken a mile away to Central <unk> Hospital , where he arrived near death . One doctor <unk> his face , calling , " Bob , Bob " , while another doctor manually <unk> Kennedy 's heart . After obtaining a good <unk> , doctors handed a <unk> to <unk> so she could hear her husband 's heart beating , much to her relief . 
 After about 30 minutes , Kennedy was transferred several blocks to the Hospital of the Good <unk> for surgery . A <unk> near the hospital was set up as temporary headquarters for the press and news media to receive updates on the senator 's condition . <unk> began at 3 : 12 a.m. PDT and lasted three hours and 40 minutes . Ten and a half hours later , at 5 : 30 p.m. PDT on Wednesday , spokesman Frank <unk> announced that Kennedy 's doctors were " concerned over his continuing failure to show improvement " ; his condition remained " extremely critical as to life " . 
 Kennedy had been shot three times . One bullet , fired at a range of about 1 inch ( 2 @.@ 5 cm ) , entered behind his right ear , <unk> fragments throughout his brain . The other two entered at the rear of his right <unk> ; one exited from his chest and the other lodged in the back of his neck . Despite extensive <unk> at the Good <unk> Hospital to remove the bullet and bone fragments from his brain , Kennedy died at 1 : 44 <unk> PDT on June 6 , nearly 26 hours after the shooting . 
 After receiving word of Senator Kennedy 's death , his spokesman Frank <unk> left the hospital and walked to the <unk> where the press and news media were set up for continuous updates on the situation . At 2 : 00 AM PDT on June 6 , <unk> approached the podium , took a few moments to compose himself and made the official announcement : 
 I have , uh , a short <unk> I have a short announcement to read , which I will read , uh <unk> at this time . Senator Robert Francis Kennedy died at 1 : 44 AM today , June 6 , 1968 . With Senator Kennedy at the time of his death were his wife <unk> , his sisters Mrs. Stephen Smith , Mrs. Patricia <unk> , his brother @-@ in @-@ law Mr. Stephen Smith , and his sister @-@ in @-@ law Mrs. John F. Kennedy . He was 42 years old . Thank you . 
 <unk> Sirhan was a Palestinian Arab with <unk> citizenship , born in Jerusalem , who held strongly anti @-@ Zionist beliefs . A diary found during a search of <unk> 's home stated for the entry on May 19 : " My determination to eliminate <unk> is becoming more and more of an <unk> obsession . <unk> must die . <unk> must be killed . Robert F. Kennedy must be assassinated <unk> Robert F. Kennedy must be assassinated before 5 June 68 . " It has been suggested that the date of the assassination is significant , because it was the first anniversary of the start of the Six Day War between Israel and its Arab neighbors . When <unk> was booked by police , they found in his pocket a newspaper article that discussed Kennedy 's support for Israel , and at his trial , <unk> testified that he began to hate Kennedy after learning of this support . In 1989 , he told David Frost : " My only connection with Robert Kennedy was his sole support of Israel and his deliberate attempt to send those 50 bombers to Israel to obviously do harm to the Palestinians " . Some scholars believe the assassination was one of the first major incidents of political violence in the United States stemming from the Arab – Israeli conflict in the Middle East . 
 The interpretation that he was mostly motivated by Middle Eastern politics has been criticized as an <unk> that ignores <unk> 's deeper psychological problems . During his trial , <unk> 's lawyers attempted to use a defense of diminished responsibility , while their client tried to confess to the crime and change his plea to guilty on several occasions . <unk> testified that he had killed Kennedy " with 20 years of <unk> <unk> " . The judge did not accept this confession and it was later withdrawn . 
 <unk> pleaded guilty on April 17 , 1969 , and six days later , he was sentenced to death . The sentence was <unk> to life in prison in 1972 after the California Supreme Court , in its decision in California v. Anderson , <unk> all pending death sentences imposed in California prior to 1972 . Since that time , <unk> has been denied parole fifteen times and is currently confined at the Richard J. <unk> <unk> <unk> in southern San Diego County . <unk> 's lawyers have claimed that he was framed , and <unk> claims to have no memory of his crime . 
 As the shooting took place , ABC News was signing off from its electoral broadcast , while the CBS broadcast was already over . It was not until 21 minutes after the shots that CBS 's coverage of the shooting would begin . The reporters who had been present to report on Kennedy 's win in the primary ended up <unk> into the kitchen where he had been shot and the immediate aftermath was captured only by audio recording and cameras that had no live transmission capability . ABC was able to show <unk> live footage from the kitchen after Kennedy had been transported but unlike CBS and NBC , all of ABC 's coverage from the Ambassador was in black and white . CBS and NBC shot footage in the kitchen of the shooting 's aftermath on color film , which could not be broadcast until it was developed two hours after the incident . 
 Reporter Andrew West of <unk> , a <unk> Broadcasting System radio affiliate in Los Angeles , captured on audio tape the sounds of the immediate aftermath of the shooting but not the actual shooting itself . Using his reel @-@ to @-@ reel tape recorder and attached microphone , West had just recorded the senator 's victory speech . With the audio still rolling , West asked the Senator the following question : 
 Andrew West : " Senator , how are you going to counter Mr. Humphrey and his <unk> you as far as the delegate votes go ? " 
 After this brief exchange , West turned off his tape recorder and followed Kennedy and his entourage to the kitchen <unk> . Just a few minutes later , seconds after Kennedy was shot , West turned his recorder on again and started reporting the sudden developments <unk> 
 Andrew West : " Senator Kennedy has been shot ! Senator Kennedy has been shot ; is that possible ? Is that possible ? It 's <unk> is it possible , ladies and gentlemen ? It is possible , he has <unk> not only Senator Kennedy , oh my God . Senator Kennedy has been shot , and another man , a Kennedy campaign manager , and possibly shot in the head . " 
 Several seconds later , West gave an on @-@ the @-@ spot account of the struggle with <unk> in the hotel kitchen <unk> , shouting at <unk> Johnson to " Get the gun , <unk> , get the gun ! " and telling others to " get a hold of [ <unk> 's ] thumb and break it , if you have to ! Get his thumb ! <unk> him , hold him ! We don 't want another Oswald ! " 
 Over the following week , NBC devoted 55 hours to the shooting and aftermath , ABC 43 , and CBS 42 , with all three networks <unk> their regular coverage and advertisements to cover the story . 
 As with the 1963 assassination of his brother , President John F. Kennedy , Robert Kennedy 's death has been the subject of widespread analysis . Some individuals involved in the original investigation and some researchers have suggested alternative scenarios for the crime , or have argued that there are serious problems with the official case . 
 In November 2006 , the BBC 's <unk> program presented research by filmmaker Shane O <unk> alleging that several CIA officers were present on the night of the assassination . Three men who appear in films and photographs from the night of the assassination were positively identified by former colleagues and associates as former senior CIA officers who had worked together in 1963 at <unk> , the CIA 's main anti @-@ Castro station based in Miami . They were <unk> Chief of Operations David <unk> , Chief of Maritime Operations Gordon Campbell and Chief of <unk> Warfare Operations George <unk> . 
 The program featured an interview with <unk> 's former attorney Robert Walton , who quoted him as having said , " I was in Dallas when we got the son of a <unk> and I was in Los Angeles when we got the little <unk> . " O <unk> reported that the CIA declined to comment on the officers in question . It was also alleged that <unk> was known for his deep anger toward the <unk> for what he saw as their betrayal during the Bay of <unk> Invasion . 
 The location of Kennedy 's wounds suggested that his assailant had stood behind him , but some witnesses said that <unk> faced west as Kennedy moved through the <unk> facing east . This has led to the suggestion that a second <unk> actually fired the fatal shot , a possibility supported by <unk> Thomas <unk> who stated that the fatal shot was behind Kennedy 's right ear and had been fired at a distance of approximately one inch . Other witnesses , though , said that as <unk> approached , Kennedy was turning to his left shaking hands , facing north and so exposing his right side . During a re @-@ examination of the case in 1975 , the Los Angeles Superior Court ordered expert examination of the possibility of a second gun having been used , and the conclusion of the experts was that there was little or no evidence to support this theory . As recently as 2008 , <unk> John <unk> asserted his belief that there must have been a second <unk> . 
 In 2007 , analysis of an audio tape recording of the shooting made by freelance reporter <unk> <unk> appeared to indicate , according to forensic expert Philip Van <unk> , that thirteen shots were fired , even though <unk> 's gun held only eight rounds . Van <unk> states that the recording also reveals at least two cases where the timing between shots was shorter than physically possible . The presence of more than eight shots on the tape was corroborated by forensic audio specialists Wes Dooley and Paul <unk> of Audio Engineering Associates in <unk> , California , forensic audio and <unk> expert Eddy B. <unk> in Copenhagen , Denmark , and audio specialist Phil Spencer Whitehead of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta , Georgia . Some other acoustic experts , however , have stated that no more than eight shots were recorded on the audio tape . 
 On February 22 , 2012 , <unk> 's lawyers , William <unk> and Laurie <unk> , filed a court brief in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles claiming that a second <unk> fired the shots that killed Kennedy . It was the fourth and final in a series of federal <unk> filed under the writ of <unk> corpus by <unk> and <unk> beginning in October 2010 . A ruling is now pending in the <unk> federal case . 
 Following the autopsy on June 6 , Kennedy 's body was returned to New York City , where he lay in <unk> at St. Patrick 's Cathedral , viewed by thousands , until a funeral mass on the morning of June 8 . 
 My brother need not be <unk> , or enlarged in death beyond what he was in life ; to be remembered simply as a good and decent man , who saw wrong and tried to right it , saw suffering and tried to heal it , saw war and tried to stop it . Those of us who loved him and who take him to his rest today , pray that what he was to us and what he wished for others will some day come to pass for all the world . As he said many times , in many parts of this nation , to those he touched and who sought to touch him : " Some men see things as they are and say why . I dream things that never were and say why not . " 
 Immediately following the mass , Kennedy 's body was transported by a slow @-@ moving train to Washington , D.C. , and thousands of mourners lined the tracks and stations , paying their respects as the train passed by . 
 On the way to the cemetery , the funeral procession passed through Resurrection City , a <unk> protest set up as part of the <unk> People 's Campaign . The procession stopped in front of the Lincoln Memorial , where residents of Resurrection City joined the group and sang " The Battle Hymn of the Republic " . 
 Kennedy was buried near his older brother John , in <unk> National Cemetery , in the first burial ever to take place there at night ; the second was the burial of his younger brother Ted . 
 After Kennedy 's assassination , Congress altered the Secret Service 's mandate to include protection for presidential candidates . The remaining candidates were immediately protected under an executive order issued by Lyndon Johnson , putting a strain on the poorly <unk> Secret Service . 
 At the time of his death , Kennedy was substantially behind Humphrey in convention delegate support , but many believe that Kennedy would have ultimately secured the nomination following his victory in the California primary . Only thirteen states held primaries that year , meaning that most delegates at the Democratic convention could choose a candidate based on their personal preference . Historian Arthur M. Schlesinger , Jr . , and others have argued that Kennedy 's broad appeal and <unk> would have been sufficiently convincing at the 1968 Democratic National Convention to give him the nomination . Historian Michael <unk> believed , however , that Kennedy would not have secured the nomination . Humphrey , after a National Convention in Chicago marred by violence in the streets , was far behind in opinion polls but gained ground . He ultimately lost the general election to Republican Richard Nixon by the narrow popular vote margin of 43 @.@ 4 % to 42 @.@ 7 % . Nixon won by a more decisive <unk> @-@ 191 margin in the electoral vote . 
 Kennedy 's assassination was a blow to the optimism for a brighter future that his campaign brought for many Americans who lived through the turbulent 1960s . Juan Romero , the <unk> who shook hands with Kennedy right before he was shot , later said , " It made me realize that no matter how much hope you have it can be taken away in a second . " 
 Jack <unk> , a reporter that had been traveling with the campaign , expressed his feelings on the effect of the assassination , closing his memoir on Kennedy with : 
 Now I realized what makes our generation unique , what defines us apart from those who came before the hopeful winter of 1961 , and those who came after the murderous spring of 1968 . We are the first generation that learned from experience , in our innocent twenties , that things were not really getting better , that we shall not overcome . We felt , by the time we reached thirty , that we had already <unk> the most <unk> leaders our nation could produce , and they had all been assassinated . And from this time forward , things would get worse : our best political leaders were part of memory now , not hope . 
 After the failed campaign of <unk> to preserve the Ambassador Hotel where Kennedy was shot , the hotel was demolished in 2005 – 2006 , with the last section of the Ambassador falling in January 2006 , leaving only the annex that housed the hotel entrance , a shopping arcade , the coffee shop , and the historic <unk> Grove , all of which were promised to be preserved in some manner . From 2006 to 2010 , six new schools were built on the site and named the Robert F. Kennedy Community Schools . Plans to re @-@ create the <unk> in the area of the school complex and create a museum , dedicated to Kennedy 's assassination , fell through after commission chairman Cruz <unk> , a former state Supreme Court justice , said in court , " We didn 't want to celebrate the death . We wanted to celebrate his life , particularly his ideals . " 
 The handcuffs that were used by now @-@ retired police officer <unk> <unk> to arrest <unk> Sirhan are now part of the collection of the upcoming National Law <unk> Museum in Washington , <unk> .. 
 The blood @-@ stained suit coat , shorts , shirt , belt , tie and socks which Kennedy wore when he was shot are now in the possession of the Los Angeles County District Attorney . Controversy arose in 2010 when Kennedy 's clothing was transported to the California <unk> <unk> Association conference in Las Vegas , where they were included in a temporary public display of never @-@ before @-@ seen artifacts from famous crime scenes , related to prolific serial <unk> and infamous murders , such as the Black <unk> murder and the murder of Hollywood actress Sharon Tate . The items and Kennedy 's clothing were subsequently removed from the exhibit and returned to the <unk> vault , with the <unk> <unk> to the Kennedy family . 
 Until 1987 , the <unk> retained the original files , reports , transcripts , fragments of the bullets that struck Kennedy and the four other <unk> in the kitchen <unk> , the <unk> caliber <unk> @-@ Johnson <unk> used by <unk> , Kennedy 's blood @-@ stained clothes , and numerous other artifacts related to the assassination . In 1987 , the <unk> donated the entire evidence collection ( except for Kennedy 's clothes which remain in possession of the <unk> ) to the California State Archives in <unk> for permanent preservation . The collection remains in the California State Archives . 
 The Robert F. Kennedy Assassination Archives at Southeastern Massachusetts University also contain a large collection of materials on the Robert Kennedy assassination . Included among these records are files donated by several writers and researchers and materials purchased from the National Archives and Records Administration @-@ Pacific Southwest Region , the Los Angeles County District Attorney 's office , and the FBI . Another source of information on the case is the Assassination Archives and Research Center . The Center maintains an extensive collection of government documents , interviews , unpublished manuscripts , photographs , audio tapes , and secondary works . 
 Some items - such as the bullet @-@ <unk> ceiling tiles - were removed long ago and intentionally destroyed by the <unk> and not used in <unk> 's trial . A large number of the photographs of the <unk> area and the tapes of the recorded interviews with individuals who were present during the assassination suffered a similar fate . <unk> theorists today believe that the destroyed evidence was vital as it proved that <unk> Sirhan may have had an accomplice and there has been a cover @-@ up , similar to the assassination of John Kennedy , Robert Kennedy 's brother . <unk> from the defunct Ambassador Hotel , ranging from bedroom furniture to silver <unk> buckets , were auctioned off over the years until the hotel 's demolition . 
 <unk> is an American comic @-@ book limited series published by DC Comics in 1986 and 1987 , and collected in 1987 . The series was created by a British collaboration consisting of writer Alan Moore , artist Dave Gibbons , and <unk> John Higgins . <unk> originated from a story proposal Moore submitted to DC featuring superhero characters that the company had acquired from Charlton Comics . As Moore 's proposed story would have left many of the characters unusable for future stories , managing editor Dick <unk> convinced Moore to create original characters instead . 
 Moore used the story as a means to reflect contemporary <unk> and to <unk> and parody the superhero concept . <unk> depicts an alternate history where <unk> emerged in the 1940s and 1960s , helping the United States to win the Vietnam War . In 1985 , the country is edging toward nuclear war with the Soviet Union , freelance <unk> <unk> have been outlawed and most former <unk> are in retirement or working for the government . The story focuses on the personal development and moral struggles of the protagonists as an investigation into the murder of a government sponsored superhero pulls them out of retirement . 
 <unk> , the focus of <unk> is on its structure . Gibbons used a nine @-@ panel grid layout throughout the series and added recurring symbols such as a blood @-@ stained <unk> face . All but the last issue feature supplemental fictional documents that add to the series ' backstory , and the narrative is intertwined with that of another story , an in @-@ story pirate comic titled Tales of the Black <unk> , which one of the characters reads . <unk> , at times , as a <unk> narrative , the story <unk> through space , time and plot . In the same manner , entire scenes and dialogue have parallels with others through <unk> , coincidence and repeated imagery . 
 A commercial success , <unk> has received critical acclaim both in the comics and mainstream press , and is considered by several critics and reviewers to be one of the most significant works of 20th @-@ century literature . <unk> was recognized in Time 's List of the 100 Best Novels as one of the best English language novels published since 1923 , and placed # 91 on The Comics Journal 's list of the top 100 comics of the 20th century . 
 After a number of attempts to adapt the series into a feature film , director Zack <unk> 's <unk> was released in 2009 . A video game series , <unk> : The End Is <unk> , was released in the same year to coincide with the film 's release . In 2012 , DC Comics published Before <unk> , a comic @-@ book series acting as a prequel to the original <unk> series , without Moore and Gibbons ' involvement . 
 <unk> , created by writer Alan Moore and artist Dave Gibbons , was first published as a 12 @-@ issue miniseries from DC Comics , cover @-@ dated September 1986 to October 1987 . It was subsequently collected in 1987 as a DC Comics trade paperback that has had at least 22 <unk> as of September 2008 ; as well , a trade paperback was published by Warner Books , a DC sister company , in 1987 . 
 In 2012 , DC launched a prequel line , with various creative teams producing the characters ' early adventures before the events of the graphic novel . 
 In 2016 DC Universe : <unk> one @-@ shot , numerous symbols of <unk> , such as the blood @-@ <unk> <unk> face , and the dialogue between Doctor Manhattan and <unk> in the last issue of <unk> is shown . Further <unk> imagery was added in the DC Universe : <unk> Special # 1 second printing , which featured an update to Gary Frank 's cover , better revealing the <unk> hand of Doctor Manhattan in the top right corner . 
 In 1985 , DC Comics acquired a line of characters from Charlton Comics . During that period , writer Alan Moore contemplated writing a story that featured an unused line of <unk> that he could revamp , as he had done in his <unk> series in the early 1980s . Moore reasoned that <unk> Comics ' Mighty Crusaders might be available for such a project , so he devised a murder mystery plot which would begin with the discovery of the body of the Shield in a harbour . The writer felt it did not matter which set of characters he ultimately used , as long as readers recognized them " so it would have the shock and surprise value when you saw what the reality of these characters was " . Moore used this premise and crafted a proposal featuring the Charlton characters titled Who <unk> the <unk> , and submitted the <unk> proposal to DC managing editor Dick <unk> . <unk> was receptive to the proposal , but opposed the idea of using the Charlton characters for the story . Moore said , " DC realized their expensive characters would end up either dead or dysfunctional . " Instead , <unk> persuaded Moore to continue with new characters . Moore had initially believed that original characters would not provide emotional resonance for the readers , but later changed his mind . He said , " Eventually , I realized that if I wrote the substitute characters well enough , so that they seemed familiar in certain ways , certain aspects of them brought back a kind of generic super @-@ hero resonance or familiarity to the reader , then it might work . " 
 Artist Dave Gibbons , who had collaborated with Moore on previous projects , recalled he " must have heard on the <unk> that he was doing a treatment for a new miniseries . I rang Alan up , saying I ’ d like to be involved with what he was doing . " and Moore sent him the story outline . Gibbons told <unk> he wanted to draw the series Moore proposed and Moore approved . Gibbons brought <unk> John Higgins onto the project because he liked his " unusual " style ; Higgins lived near the artist , which allowed the two to " discuss [ the art ] and have some kind of human contact rather than just sending it across the ocean " . Len <unk> joined the project as its editor , while <unk> stayed on to oversee it . Both <unk> and <unk> stood back and " got out of their way " ; <unk> remarked later , " Who copy @-@ <unk> Alan Moore , for God 's sake ? " 
 After receiving the go @-@ ahead to work on the project , Moore and Gibbons spent a day at the latter 's house creating characters , crafting details for the story 's milieu and discussing influences . The pair was particularly influenced by a Mad parody of Superman named " <unk> " ; Moore said , " We wanted to take <unk> 180 degrees — dramatic , instead of comedic " . Moore and Gibbons conceived of a story that would take " familiar old @-@ fashioned <unk> into a completely new realm " ; the writer said his intention was to create " a superhero <unk> Dick ; something that had that sort of weight , that sort of density " . The writer came up with the character names and descriptions , but left the specifics of how they looked to Gibbons . Gibbons did not sit down and design the characters deliberately , but rather " did it at odd times ... spend [ ing ] maybe two or three weeks just doing sketches . " Gibbons designed his characters to make them easy to draw ; <unk> was his favorite to draw because " you just have to draw a hat . If you can draw a hat , then you 've drawn <unk> , you just draw kind of a shape for his face and put some black <unk> on it and you 're done . " 
 Moore began writing the series very early on , hoping to avoid publication delays such as those faced by the DC limited series <unk> 3000 . When writing the script for the first issue , Moore said he realized , " I only had enough plot for six issues . We were contracted for 12 ! " His solution was to alternate issues that dealt with the overall plot of the series with origin issues for the characters . Moore wrote very detailed scripts for Gibbons to work from . Gibbons recalled that " [ t ] he script for the first issue of <unk> was , I think , 101 pages of <unk> — single @-@ spaced — with no gaps between the individual panel descriptions or , indeed , even between the pages . " Upon receiving the scripts , the artist had to number each page " in case I drop them on the floor , because it would take me two days to put them back in the right order " , and used a <unk> pen to single out <unk> and shot descriptions ; he remarked , " It takes quite a bit of organizing before you can actually put pen to paper . " Despite Moore 's detailed scripts , his panel descriptions would often end with the note " If that doesn 't work for you , do what works best " ; Gibbons nevertheless worked to Moore 's instructions . In fact , Gibbons only suggested a single change to the script : a compression of <unk> ' narration while he was preventing a sneak attack by <unk> , as he felt that the dialog was too long to fit with the amount of action expressed ; Moore agreed and re @-@ wrote the scene . Gibbons had a great deal of autonomy in developing the visual look of <unk> , and frequently inserted background details that Moore admitted he did not notice until later . Moore occasionally contacted fellow comics writer Neil Gaiman for answers to research questions and for quotes to include in issues . 
 Despite his intentions , Moore admitted in November 1986 that there were likely to be delays , stating that he was , with issue five on the stands , still writing issue nine . Gibbons mentioned that a major factor in the delays was the " <unk> way " in which he received Moore 's scripts . Gibbons said the team 's pace slowed around the fourth issue ; from that point onward the two undertook their work " just several pages at a time . I 'll get three pages of script from Alan and draw it and then toward the end , call him up and say , ' <unk> me ! ' And he 'll send another two or three pages or maybe one page or sometimes six pages . " As the creators began to hit deadlines , Moore would hire a taxi driver to drive 50 miles and deliver scripts to Gibbons . On later issues the artist even had his wife and son draw panel <unk> on pages to help save time . 
 Near the end of the project , Moore realized that the story bore some similarity to " The Architects of Fear " , an episode of The Outer <unk> television series . The writer and <unk> argued over changing the ending , and when Moore refused to give in , <unk> quit the book . <unk> explained , " I kept telling him , ' Be more original , Alan , you 've got the capability , do something different , not something that 's already been done ! ' And he didn 't seem to care enough to do that . " Moore acknowledged the Outer <unk> episode by referencing it in the series ' last issue . 
 <unk> is set in an alternate reality that closely mirrors the contemporary world of the 1980s . The primary difference is the presence of <unk> . The point of divergence occurs in the year 1938 . Their existence in this version of America is shown to have dramatically affected and altered the outcomes of real @-@ world events such as the Vietnam War and the presidency of Richard Nixon . In keeping with the realism of the series , although the <unk> <unk> of <unk> are commonly called " <unk> " , only one ( Doctor Manhattan ) possesses any superhuman powers . The war in Vietnam ends with a U.S. victory in 1971 and Nixon is still president as of October 1985 . The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan occurs approximately six years later than in real life . When the story begins , the existence of Doctor Manhattan has given the U.S. a strategic advantage over the Soviet Union , which has increased tensions between the two nations . Eventually , <unk> grow unpopular among the police and the public , leading to the passage of legislation ( the Keene Act ) in 1977 to outlaw them . While many of the heroes retired , Doctor Manhattan and a veteran superhero known as The <unk> operate as government @-@ sanctioned agents . Another , <unk> , continues to operate outside the law . 
 After Blake 's funeral , Manhattan is accused on national television of being the cause of cancer in friends and former colleagues . When the U.S. government takes the accusations seriously , Manhattan exiles himself to Mars . As Manhattan is one of the United States ' greatest military powers , his departure throws humanity into political turmoil , with the Soviet Union invading Afghanistan to capitalize on the perceived American weakness . <unk> 's concerns appear vindicated when Adrian <unk> narrowly survives an assassination attempt , and <unk> himself is framed for murdering <unk> , a former <unk> . 
 With <unk> , Alan Moore 's intention was to create four or five " radically opposing ways " to perceive the world and to give readers of the story the privilege of determining which one was most morally <unk> . Moore did not believe in the notion of " [ <unk> ] regurgitated morals " down the readers ' <unk> and instead sought to show heroes in an ambivalent light . Moore said , " What we wanted to do was show all of these people , warts and all . Show that even the worst of them had something going for them , and even the best of them had their flaws . " 
 Drawing inspiration from Alexander the Great , <unk> was once the superhero <unk> , but has since retired to devote his attention to the running of his own enterprises . <unk> is believed to be the <unk> man on the planet . <unk> was based on Peter Cannon , <unk> ; Moore liked the idea of a character who " us [ ed ] the full 100 % of his brain " and " [ had ] complete physical and mental control " . Richard Reynolds noted that by taking initiative to " help the world " , <unk> displays a trait normally attributed to villains in superhero stories , and in a sense he is the " villain " of the series . Gibbons noted , " One of the worst of his sins [ is ] kind of looking down on the rest of humanity , <unk> the rest of humanity . " 
 The daughter of <unk> Jupiter ( the first Silk <unk> , with whom she has a strained relationship ) and The <unk> . Of Polish heritage , she had been the lover of Doctor Manhattan for years . While Silk <unk> was based partially on the Charlton character <unk> , Moore was not impressed by the character and drew more from <unk> such as Black Canary and Phantom Lady . 
 Moore and Gibbons designed <unk> to showcase the unique qualities of the comics medium and to highlight its particular strengths . In a 1986 interview , Moore said , " What I 'd like to explore is the areas that comics succeed in where no other media is capable of operating " , and emphasized this by stressing the differences between comics and film . Moore said that <unk> was designed to be read " four or five times " , with some links and allusions only becoming apparent to the reader after several readings . Dave Gibbons notes that , " [ a ] s it progressed , <unk> became much more about the telling than the tale itself . The main thrust of the story essentially <unk> on what is called a <unk> , a gimmick ... So really the plot itself is of no great consequence ... it just really isn 't the most interesting thing about <unk> . As we actually came to tell the tale , that 's where the real creativity came in . " 
 Gibbons said he deliberately constructed the visual look of <unk> so that each page would be identifiable as part of that particular series and " not some other comic book " . He made a <unk> effort to draw the characters in a manner different than that commonly seen in comics . The artist tried to draw the series with " a particular weight of line , using a hard , stiff pen that didn 't have much <unk> in terms of thick and thin " which he hoped " would differentiate it from the usual lush , fluid kind of comic book line " . In a 2009 interview , Moore recalled that he took advantage of Gibbons ' training as a former surveyor for " including incredible amounts of detail in every tiny panel , so we could <unk> every little thing " . Gibbons described the series as " a comic about comics " . Gibbons felt that " Alan is more concerned with the social implications of [ the presence of super @-@ heroes ] and I 've gotten involved in the technical implications . " The story 's alternate world setting allowed Gibbons to change details of the American landscape , such as adding electric cars , slightly different buildings , and spark <unk> instead of fire <unk> , which Moore said , " perhaps gives the American readership a chance in some ways to see their own culture as an <unk> would " . Gibbons noted that the setting was liberating for him because he did not have to rely primarily on reference books . 
 <unk> John Higgins used a template that was " <unk> " and favored secondary colors . Moore stated that he had also " always loved John 's coloring , but always associated him with being an <unk> <unk> " , which Moore was not fond of ; Higgins subsequently decided to color <unk> in European @-@ style flat color . Moore noted that the artist paid particular attention to lighting and subtle color changes ; in issue six , Higgins began with " warm and cheerful " colors and throughout the issue gradually made it darker to give the story a dark and bleak feeling . 
 <unk> , certain aspects of <unk> <unk> from the norm in comic books at the time , particularly the panel layout and the coloring . Instead of panels of various sizes , the creators divided each page into a nine @-@ panel grid . Gibbons favored the nine @-@ panel grid system due to its " authority " . Moore accepted the use of the nine @-@ panel grid format , which " gave him a level of control over the storytelling he hadn 't had previously " , according to Gibbons . " There was this element of the pacing and visual impact that he could now predict and use to dramatic effect . " <unk> Stewart of The Comics Journal mentioned to Gibbons in 1987 , that the page layouts recalled those of <unk> Comics , in addition to the art itself , which Stewart felt particularly echoed that of John <unk> . Gibbons agreed that the echoing of the <unk> @-@ style layouts " was a very deliberate thing " , although his inspiration was rather Harvey <unk> , but it was altered enough to give the series a unique look . The artist also cited Steve <unk> 's work on early issues of The Amazing <unk> @-@ Man as an influence , as well as Doctor Strange , where " even at his most psychedelic [ he ] would still keep a pretty straight page layout " . 
 The cover of each issue serves as the first panel to the story . Gibbons said , " The cover of the <unk> is in the real world and looks quite real , but it 's starting to turn into a comic book , a portal to another dimension . " The covers were designed as close @-@ ups that focused on a single detail with no human elements present . The creators on occasion experimented with the layout of the issue contents . Gibbons drew issue five , titled " <unk> <unk> " , so the first page mirrors the last ( in terms of frame disposition ) , with the following pages mirroring each other before the center @-@ spread is ( broadly ) symmetrical in layout . 
 The end of each issue , with the exception of issue twelve , contains supplemental prose pieces written by Moore . Among the contents are fictional book chapters , letters , reports , and articles written by various <unk> characters . DC had trouble selling ad space in issues of <unk> , which left an extra eight to nine pages per issue . DC planned to insert house <unk> and a longer letters column to fill the space , but editor Len <unk> felt this would be unfair to anyone who wrote in during the last four issues of the series . He decided to use the extra pages to fill out the series ' backstory . Moore said , " By the time we got around to issue # 3 , # 4 , and so on , we thought that the book looked nice without a letters page . It looks less like a comic book , so we stuck with it . " 
 Moore named William S. <unk> as one of his main influences during the conception of <unk> . He admired <unk> ' use of " repeated symbols that would become laden with meaning " in <unk> ' only comic strip , " The <unk> Mr. Hart " , which appeared in the British underground magazine <unk> . Not every <unk> link in the series was planned by Moore , who remarked that " there 's stuff in there Dave had put in that even I only noticed on the sixth or seventh read " , while other " things ... turned up in there by accident . " 
 Other symbols , images and allusion that appeared throughout the series often emerged unexpectedly . Moore mentioned that " [ t ] he whole thing with <unk> has just been loads of these little bits of <unk> popping up all over the place " . Gibbons noted an <unk> theme was contrasting the mundane and the romantic , citing the separate sex scenes between <unk> Owl and Silk <unk> on his <unk> and then high in the sky on <unk> Owl 's airship . In a book of the craters and boulders of Mars , Gibbons discovered a photograph of the <unk> crater , which resembles a happy face , which they worked into an issue . Moore said , " We found a lot of these things started to generate themselves as if by magic " , in particular citing an occasion where they decided to name a lock company the " Gordian <unk> Lock Company " . 
 Moore has expressed dismay that " [ t ] he gritty , <unk> <unk> superhero comic , as exemplified by <unk> ... became a genre " . He said in 2003 that " to some degree there has been , in the 15 years since <unk> , an awful lot of the comics field devoted to these <unk> , pessimistic , nasty , violent stories which kind of use <unk> to <unk> what are , in effect , often just some very nasty stories that don 't have a lot to recommend them . " Gibbons said that while readers " were left with the idea that it was a <unk> and gritty kind of thing " , he said in his view the series was " a wonderful celebration of <unk> as much as anything else . " 
 <unk> was published in single @-@ issue form over the course of 1986 and 1987 . The limited series was a commercial success , and its sales helped DC Comics briefly <unk> its competitor Marvel Comics in the comic book direct market . The series ' publishing schedule ran into delays because it was scheduled with three issues completed instead of the six editor Len <unk> believed were necessary . Further delays were caused when later issues each took more than a month to complete . One contemporaneous report noted that although DC solicited issue # 12 for publication in April 1987 , it became apparent " it won 't debut until July or August " . 
 After the series concluded , the individual issues were collected and sold in trade paperback form . Along with Frank Miller 's 1986 Batman : The Dark Knight <unk> miniseries , <unk> was marketed as a " graphic novel " , a term that allowed DC and other publishers to sell similar comic book collections in a way that associated them with novels and <unk> them from comics . As a result of the publicity given to the books like the <unk> trade in 1987 , bookstore and public libraries began to devote special shelves to them . Subsequently , new comics series were commissioned on the basis of <unk> them in a collected form for these markets . 
 <unk> received critical praise , both inside and outside of the comics industry . Time magazine , which noted that the series was " by common assent the best of breed " of the new wave of comics published at the time , praised <unk> as " a <unk> feat of imagination , combining <unk> @-@ fi , political satire , knowing <unk> of comics past and bold <unk> of current graphic formats into a <unk> [ sic ] mystery story . " In 1988 , <unk> received a Hugo Award in the Other Forms category . 
 <unk> about the ownership of the story ultimately led Moore to <unk> ties with DC Comics . Not wanting to work under a work for hire arrangement , Moore and Gibbons had a <unk> clause in their contract for <unk> . Speaking at the 1985 San Diego Comic @-@ Con , Moore said , " The way it works , if I understand it , is that DC owns it for the time they 're publishing it , and then it <unk> to Dave and me , so we can make all the money from the <unk> cups . " For <unk> , Moore and Gibbons received eight percent of the series ' earnings . Moore explained in 1986 that his understanding was that when " DC have not used the characters for a year , they 're <unk> . " Both Moore and Gibbons said DC paid them " a substantial amount of money " to retain the rights . Moore added , " So basically they 're not <unk> , but if DC is working with the characters in our interests then they might as well be . On the other hand , if the characters have <unk> their natural life span and DC doesn 't want to do anything with them , then after a year we 've got them and we can do what we want with them , which I 'm perfectly happy with . " 
 Moore said he left DC in 1989 due to the language in his contracts for <unk> and his V for Vendetta series with artist David Lloyd . Moore felt the <unk> clauses were ultimately meaningless , because DC did not intend to let the publications go out of print . He told The New York Times in 2006 , " I said , ' Fair enough , ' [ ... ] ' You have managed to successfully <unk> me , and so I will never work for you again . ' " In 2000 , Moore publicly distanced himself from DC 's plans for a 15th anniversary <unk> hardcover release as well as a proposed line of action figures from DC Direct . While DC wanted to <unk> its relationship with the writer , Moore felt the company was not treating him fairly in regards to his America 's Best Comics imprint ( launched under the <unk> comic imprint , which was bought by DC in 1998 ; Moore was promised no direct interference by DC as part of the arrangement ) . Moore added , " As far as I 'm concerned , the 15th anniversary of <unk> is purely a 15th <unk> of when DC managed to take the <unk> property from me and Dave [ Gibbons ] . " Soon afterward , DC Direct cancelled the <unk> action @-@ figure line , despite the company having displayed prototypes at the 2000 San Diego Comic @-@ Con International . 
 The Tales of the Black <unk> segments was adapted as a direct @-@ to @-@ video animated feature to be released that same month . Gerard Butler , who starred in 300 , voices the Captain in the film . The film itself was released on DVD four months after Tales of the Black <unk> , and in November 2009 , a four @-@ disc set was released as the " Ultimate Cut " with the animated film edited back into the main picture . Len <unk> , the comic 's editor , wrote a video game prequel entitled <unk> : The End Is <unk> . 
 Dave Gibbons became an adviser on <unk> 's film , but Moore has refused to have his name attached to any film adaptations of his work . Moore has stated he has no interest in seeing <unk> 's adaptation ; he told Entertainment Weekly in 2008 , " There are things that we did with <unk> that could only work in a comic , and were indeed designed to show off things that other media can 't " . While Moore believes that David <unk> 's screenplay was " as close as I could imagine anyone getting to <unk> " , he asserted he did not intend to see the film if it were made . 
 In 2008 , Warner Bros. Entertainment released <unk> Motion Comics , a series of narrated animations of the original comic book . The first chapter was released for purchase in the summer of 2008 on digital video stores , such as iTunes Store . A DVD compiling the full motion comic series was released in March 2009 . 
 A critical and commercial success , <unk> is highly regarded in the comics industry and is frequently considered by several critics and reviewers as comics ' greatest series and graphic novel . In time , the series has also become one of the best @-@ selling graphic novels ever published . <unk> was the only graphic novel to appear on Time 's 2005 " All @-@ Time 100 Greatest Novels " list , where Time critic Lev Grossman described the story as " a heart @-@ pounding , heartbreaking read and a watershed in the evolution of a young medium . " It later appeared on Time 's 2009 " Top 10 Graphic Novels " list , where Grossman further praised <unk> , proclaiming " It ’ s way beyond cliché at this point to call <unk> the greatest superhero comic ever written @-@ slash @-@ drawn . But it ’ s true . " In 2008 , Entertainment Weekly placed <unk> at number 13 on its list of the best 50 novels printed in the last 25 years , describing it as " The greatest superhero story ever told and proof that comics are capable of smart , emotionally <unk> narratives worthy of the label ' literature ' . " The Comics Journal , however , ranked <unk> at number 91 on its list of the Top 100 English @-@ language comics of the 20th century . 
 <unk> was one of the two comic books , alongside Batman : The Dark Knight <unk> , that inspired designer Vincent <unk> when he created the Comic Sans font . 
 In 2009 , Brain <unk> Studios released the parody <unk> , a comic in which writer Rich Johnston chronicled " the debate surrounding <unk> , the original contracts , the current legal suits over the Fox contract " . 
 <unk> <unk> is a fictional character who appears on a recurring basis in the fifth , sixth and seventh series of the American science fiction television series Star Trek : The Next Generation . <unk> by Michelle Forbes , she is a member of the <unk> race who joins the crew of the USS Enterprise @-@ D at the invitation of Captain Jean @-@ Luc Picard ( Patrick Stewart ) . The character was intended to both be at odds with the series regulars , as well as to replace Wesley Crusher at the <unk> officer post on the bridge . Forbes was cast to portray <unk> , after previously appearing in the series as <unk> in the episode " Half a Life " . 
 <unk> was also planned to be a main character in Star Trek : Deep Space Nine . However , Forbes turned down the role , so <unk> Nerys was created to replace her . In the non @-@ canonical novels , <unk> eventually joins the <unk> militia and is posted onto Deep Space Nine . She re @-@ joins Starfleet when <unk> joins the Federation , and eventually becomes captain of the station . Reviewers discussed the religious views of <unk> , comparing her views to those of <unk> . <unk> has been received positively by both critics and fans alike . Critics have praised the performances of Forbes , and the interaction of <unk> with the existing characters . She has been placed in several polls listing the most popular characters , with Jordan Hoffman calling her the second strongest female character in the franchise . 
 During the course of planning out the fifth season of Star Trek : The Next Generation , the producers were looking to add a recurring character who could conflict with the regular cast at times as well as a new <unk> officer to replace Wesley Crusher . With that in mind , the episode " Ensign <unk> " was written by Michael <unk> , from a story idea created in conjunction with Rick Berman , to specifically introduce the character of Ensign <unk> <unk> . The episode was designed to show a backstory for the character , who would be at odds with series creator Gene Roddenberry 's ideal that Starfleet officers should all work together seamlessly . One of her major character traits was that she would be a member of an <unk> people , whose homeworld had been conquered by another . <unk> producer <unk> Taylor explained that they had sought to add some " fresh life " using a darker character . 
 <unk> described the addition of <unk> to the cast as one of that season 's biggest accomplishments , and was pleased that it was well received . He added that in " Ensign <unk> " , they made a deliberate decision to have <unk> embraced by Guinan in order to ensure that the fans warmed to the new addition . <unk> felt that when Guinan took <unk> to meet Captain Jean @-@ Luc Picard in that episode , the character was effectively presenting <unk> to the fans of the series and <unk> her . During the writing process , he felt that once he came across the friendship between Guinan and <unk> that he believed " we had really done something magnificent " . Forbes , meanwhile , praised the writing and the cast of the series , saying that she had " become very attached to Star Trek " . 
 Forbes made a single appearance in the sixth season , in the episode " <unk> " . In the plot of the episode , a transporter accidentally turns <unk> , among others , in a child . There was some consideration after the episode about whether or not to keep <unk> as a child , as her return to adulthood was never shown on screen . Taylor said that the change would have been " too drastic for us " , and the idea was abandoned . Her final appearance , in the penultimate episode of the series , " <unk> Strike " , had been considered a long shot by the producers . After the failure to agree her appearances on Star Trek : Deep Space Nine , Forbes ' agent had warned them to stay away from her . A week prior to filming , there was no story created for the episode other than the idea it would follow on from the Deep Space Nine episode " The <unk> " , and no agreement had been reached with Forbes to appear . Her agent indicated that Forbes wanted to talk directly to the producers , so she made the phone call , making up a story for the episode as the conversation went on . Forbes agreed , making her final appearance in the franchise . The character was promoted to Lieutenant , and Forbes wore updated <unk> makeup developed by <unk> for Deep Space Nine . 
 " Ensign <unk> " proved influential on the creation of Deep Space Nine , with the <unk> and <unk> taken directly from the episode . The character was included in the original series description , stationed on the <unk> @-@ based Starfleet station and the producers had planned for her to be promoted to Lieutenant in an episode of The Next Generation prior to the start of Deep Space Nine . Taylor had expected <unk> to be written out of The Next Generation , and so had taken some steps to see that the character was replaced . She said that " We all just love Michelle Forbes " , but the plans to replace <unk> would not seek to add someone with the type of fire shown by the character in such episodes as " The Next Phase " . She also said that if <unk> to remain on The Next Generation , then the character would have naturally evolved away from that conflicted position anyway . 
 Both Berman and <unk> sought to have Forbes sign on to portray <unk> as a main character in the series , but she turned them down . She liked making occasional appearances on The Next Generation , but did not want to tie herself down to a five to six year main cast contract at that point in her career . She was also <unk> about the types of demands fan appearances made on the stars of that series , and did not want to undertake the level of appearances that would be expected of a main cast member in Deep Space Nine . The producers of Deep Space Nine decided create a new character to fit a similar mould , which resulted in the creation of <unk> Nerys , who was played by <unk> <unk> . This was designed to require as minimal a change as possible in the premise of the pilot at that time , which was already under production . During the course of the series , Forbes told <unk> that she was interested in making one @-@ off appearances in the series if she liked the story and role . 
 <unk> joined Starfleet , and after being posted to the USS Wellington , she formed part of an away team . During that mission , she <unk> orders , resulting in the death of eight crewmen . She was subsequently court @-@ <unk> , and was imprisoned on <unk> II . Admiral <unk> ( Cliff Potts ) later gave her a pardon and allowed her to return to Starfleet service , in return for convincing the <unk> terrorist <unk> ( Jeffrey <unk> ) to call off his attacks after a raid on a Federation colony . He brings her to the USS Enterprise for the purpose of completing this mission . 
 She began to appear in the Deep Space Nine relaunch novels beginning with the two @-@ part Avatar by Perry . The relaunch novels show the events that occur after the final episode of the television series . In Avatar , <unk> enlists in the <unk> Militia with the rank of Lieutenant , and is assigned to Deep Space Nine as the new Security Chief under the command of Colonel <unk> . This move for <unk> is also chronicled in the background to the massively multiplayer online role @-@ playing game Star Trek Online .

 <unk> Dunham ( born June 18 , 1993 ) is an American basketball player who recently completed his college career for the Butler Bulldogs . He is currently playing his senior season on the 2015 – 16 team . At <unk> Heights High School in <unk> , Indiana , Dunham led the state of Indiana in scoring as a senior with 29 @.@ 5 points per game and was named Herald Bulletin Player of the Year . Dunham committed to Butler on July 7 , 2010 and was highly regarded by recruiting services . As a freshman , he was a 2012 – 13 Atlantic 10 All @-@ Rookie Team selection . He scored 16 @.@ 4 points per game as a sophomore and was named to the 2013 – 14 All @-@ Big East Second @-@ team . He was a 2014 – 15 All @-@ Big East First @-@ team selection as a junior . 
 Dunham was born on June 18 , 1993 , the son of Christy and Jim Dunham . He has three younger brothers : Kenton , Cole , and <unk> . Both his parents are basketball fans and raised their sons in a Christian household . Young <unk> learned to shoot on a " Little <unk> " <unk> in the Dunham living room . He improved his game through constant practice in elementary school and middle school , to the consternation of some of his friends . When he was in eight grade , he worked on his jump shot with shooting coach Mark Baker , where Dunham learned how to shoot over his head . 
 Dunham attended <unk> Heights High School , where he measured 5 feet 10 inches ( 1 @.@ 78 m ) as a freshman . <unk> Heights head coach Brian <unk> described him as " <unk> , <unk> , and slow . " In practices , he would shoot for 45 minutes after his teammates were finished . He shot up to 6 feet 4 inches ( 1 @.@ 93 m ) as a sophomore and averaged 17 @.@ 0 points per game . He improved those numbers to 23 @.@ 5 points per game as a junior , leading <unk> Heights to a 20 – 6 record . As a junior , he scored 41 points against Fort Wayne <unk> High School . 
 He signed a letter of intent with Butler on July 7 , 2010 . <unk> ranked him the 21st best shooting guard and 93rd best overall player . ESPN included Butler 's 2012 recruiting class among its top recruiting classes from teams in non @-@ BCS conferences , noting Dunham was listed as an ESPN Top 100 recruit and is " a sniper to run off screens and create movement in the <unk> sets for the next four years . " In ESPN 's <unk> report , Dunham was listed as the 78th best overall player , due in large part to the fact that what he " does really well is shoot the basketball . How he goes about his business is akin to a master craftsman applying his trade . Dunham is in constant motion , working to get himself in position to score and he 's typically shot @-@ ready . " <unk> listed him as the best shooter among all recruits of non @-@ BCS teams . Butler head coach Brad Stevens said , " the thing he brings is an incredible ability to put the ball through the net . " 
 Coming into his freshman year on the 2012 – 13 team , Dunham was named to the <unk> All @-@ Atlantic 10 Rookie Team . Dunham began <unk> basketball drills late at night thanks to senior <unk> Clarke , and the two became fast friends . In his first college basketball game , a win against <unk> , Dunham came off the bench to score 18 points . He was named Atlantic 10 Rookie of the Week on November 12 , 2012 . During the 2012 Maui <unk> Tournament in 2012 , Dunham had one his best games as a freshman as Butler routed the then # 9 team in the country , North Carolina , shooting 56 % ( 5 of 9 ) from 3 @-@ point range and scoring 17 points .

 <unk> bombs were conventional aerial bombs developed by the Manhattan Project and used by the United States Army Air Forces against Japan during World War II . The <unk> bomb was a close replication of the Fat Man plutonium bomb with the same ballistic and handling characteristics , but used non @-@ nuclear conventional high @-@ explosive . It was mainly used for testing and training purposes , which included combat missions flown with <unk> bombs by the <unk> Composite Group . The name " <unk> bomb " resulted from the large , fat <unk> shape of the <unk> instead of the more usual cylindrical shape of other bombs and was the actual reference term used in official documents . 
 <unk> bombs were a means of providing realistic training for the <unk> Composite Group 's Boeing B @-@ 29 <unk> crews assigned to drop the atomic bomb . The <unk> bomb was a close , but non @-@ nuclear replication of the Fat Man plutonium bomb with the same ballistic and handling characteristics . Specifications for the bomb required that it be carried in the forward bomb bay of a <unk> B @-@ 29 bomber and be <unk> to be effective against actual targets . 
 <unk> bombs were produced in both inert and high explosive variants . The inert versions were filled with a cement @-@ plaster @-@ sand mixture that was combined with water to 1 @.@ 67 to 1 @.@ 68 grams per cubic <unk> ( 0 @.@ 060 to 0 @.@ <unk> lb / cu in ) , the density of the Composition B high explosive versions . The <unk> of both variants had the same weight and weight distribution as the inner sphere of the plutonium bomb . The concept for the high explosive <unk> bomb was originated in December 1944 by U.S. Navy Captain William S. Parsons , the head of the Ordnance Division at Manhattan Project 's Los Alamos Laboratory , and United States Army Air Forces Lieutenant Colonel Paul W. <unk> , commander of the <unk> Composite Group . Prior testing was carried out with an inert version . 
 The name " <unk> bomb " was given to the training bombs by Parsons and Dr. Charles C. <unk> of the California Institute of Technology , who managed the development team . The name was used in official meetings and documents , and probably referred to its large <unk> shape . Although <unk> sources attribute the naming of the bombs to painting them a <unk> color , the bombs were actually painted olive drab or <unk> . <unk> indicate that the units delivered to <unk> were painted in the same zinc <unk> <unk> color ( i.e. , yellow ) worn by Fat Man . 
 While many Manhattan scientists expected that the development of the means of delivery of the atomic bomb would be straightforward , Parsons , with his experience of the proximity <unk> program , expected that it would involve considerable effort . The test program was initiated on 13 August 1943 at the Naval <unk> Ground in Dahlgren , Virginia , where a scale model of the Fat Man plutonium bomb was developed . On 3 March 1944 , testing moved to <unk> Army Air Field , California . The initial tests demonstrated that the Fat Man assembly was unstable in flight , and that its <unk> did not work properly . 
 The shells of the <unk> bomb were manufactured by two Los Angeles firms , Consolidated Steel Corporation and Western Pipe and Steel Company , while the tail assembly was produced by <unk> Company of Detroit . After initial development , management of the program was turned over to the U.S. Navy Bureau of Ordnance in May 1945 . A total of 486 live and inert training bombs were eventually delivered , at a cost of between $ 1 @,@ 000 and $ 2 @,@ 000 apiece . 
 All of the inert versions went from the manufacturers directly to <unk> Army Air Field , Utah , by rail , where they were used by the <unk> Base Unit in flight testing of the bomb . Some test drop missions were flown by the <unk> Composite Group 's <unk> <unk> Squadron as training exercises . The bombs intended as live ordnance were shipped to the Naval <unk> Depot , <unk> , Oklahoma , for filling with explosives . The Composition B was poured as a <unk> , solidified in a drying facility for 36 hours , sealed , and shipped by railroad to the Port Chicago Naval Magazine , California , for shipment by sea to <unk> . 
 The <unk> bombs were 10 feet 8 inches ( 3 @.@ 25 m ) in length and 60 inches ( 1 @,@ 500 mm ) in maximum diameter . They weighed 5 @.@ 26 long tons ( 5 @,@ 340 kg ) , consisting of 3 @,@ 800 pounds ( 1 @,@ 700 kg ) for the shell , 425 pounds ( 193 kg ) for the tail assembly , and 6 @,@ 300 pounds ( 2 @,@ 900 kg ) of Composition B <unk> . The shells were made of <unk> @-@ inch ( 9 @.@ 5 mm ) steel plate and the tail assemblies from <unk> @-@ inch ( 5 @.@ 1 mm ) aluminum plate . 
 Combat missions were flown by the <unk> Composite Group on 20 , 23 , 26 and 29 July and 8 and 14 August 1945 , using the bombs against individual targets in Japanese cities . A total of 49 bombs were dropped on 14 targets , one bomb was <unk> into the ocean , and two were aboard aircraft that <unk> their missions . 
 Mission parameters and protocols were similar to those of the actual atomic bomb missions , and all targets were located in the vicinity of the cities designated for atomic attack . The bombs were released at an altitude of 30 @,@ 000 feet ( 9 @,@ 100 m ) and the aircraft then went into the sharp turn required on a nuclear mission . After the war , the Strategic <unk> Survey concluded that the <unk> bombs were " a reasonably effective weapon against Japanese plants when direct hits were scored on vital areas , or when the near miss was sufficiently close to important buildings to cause severe structural damage . " 
 The Barton <unk> , opened on 17 July 1761 , carried the <unk> Canal over the River <unk> at Barton @-@ upon @-@ <unk> in Greater Manchester , England . Designed largely by James <unk> under the direction of John Gilbert , it was the first navigable <unk> to be built in England , " one of the seven wonders of the canal age " according to industrial archaeologist Mike <unk> . 
 Construction proceeded quickly , but disaster almost struck when the <unk> was first filled with water and one of its three arches began to <unk> under the weight . Remedial work took several months , but the <unk> was still opened to traffic only 15 months after the enabling Act of Parliament had been passed , on 17 July 1761 . It remained in use for more than 100 years , until the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal necessitated its demolition in 1893 , replaced by the Barton Swing <unk> . 
 The original intention was for the <unk> Canal to reach Salford from the Duke of <unk> 's coal mines in <unk> , by remaining on the north bank of the <unk> . Work began in 1759 , but it was quickly decided to alter the route by building a masonry <unk> to carry the waterway over the <unk> at Barton , and terminate instead in Manchester , to the south of the river . A Bill to <unk> the new route was presented to parliament on 13 November 1759 , and in January the following year <unk> travelled to London to give evidence before a parliamentary committee in support of the proposal . 
 Although a gifted engineer <unk> had no formal education and rarely , if ever , committed his designs to paper . When questioned by the parliamentary committee about the composition of the puddle he frequently referred to in his evidence , he had a mass of clay brought into the committee room . He then formed the clay into a trough and showed how it would only form a <unk> seal if it had been worked with water to form puddle . " Thus it is " said <unk> " that I form a <unk> @-@ trunk to carry water over rivers and valleys wherever they cross the path of the canal . " Later , when asked to produce a drawing of the bridge or <unk> he proposed to build , he replied that he had no representation of it on paper but would demonstrate his intention by use of a model . He then went out and bought a large round of Cheshire cheese , which he divided into two equal halves saying " Here is my model " . Then , to the amusement of the committee , he used the two halves of cheese to represent the semicircular arches and laid a long , rectangular object over the top to demonstrate the position of the river flowing under the <unk> and the canal flowing over it . 
 Although the duke had seen navigable <unk> in use on canals when travelling abroad on his Grand Tour , the idea of an such a structure carrying a canal over a river was new to England and was ridiculed by contemporary engineers . One brought in to review the plans , at <unk> 's request , commented in a report to the Duke of <unk> that " I have often heard of castles in the air , but never before saw where one was to be erected . " The necessary Act of Parliament was passed in March <unk> , and was quite specific about the form the <unk> had to take , to protect the viability of the <unk> & <unk> Navigation below . There was already a three @-@ arch road bridge , Barton Bridge , passing over the <unk> , and the <unk> was required not to restrict traffic on the river any more than the road bridge already did . It had to have the same number of arches , the foundations for which had to be fixed in the river bed , and the arches had to be at least as wide and high as those of the road bridge . 
 At about 200 yards ( 180 m ) long , 12 yards ( 11 m ) wide and 39 feet ( 12 m ) above the river at its highest point , the <unk> was , for its time , an enormous construction . Early illustrations show the <unk> 's piers to have been flat @-@ faced , but an engraving of 1864 shows them to have pointed <unk> extending beyond the spring of the arch ; it is likely that the piers were <unk> in the early 1820s . The arches were composed of several rings of brickwork , with masonry used for decorative <unk> . All the masonry used in the structure was <unk> ashlar . 
 On the day it was first tested the water was allowed to flow in , but one of the arches began to <unk> under the weight . <unk> , overcome with anxiety , retired to his bed at the Bishop <unk> tavern in nearby <unk> . Gilbert , realising that <unk> had placed too much weight on the sides of the arch , removed the clay and laid layers of straw and <unk> <unk> clay ; when the water was allowed to flow in again the masonry held firm . According to a statement by Francis <unk> , 8th Earl of <unk> printed in 1820 , his uncle , the duke , had told him that there was a distortion of one of the arches , and that Gilbert had addressed the problem by placing more weight on the crown of the arch and less on the <unk> . The arch was then covered with straw and allowed to stand until the following spring , when the mortar was set and the arch had become stable , but its curve remained irregular . 
 The <unk> was opened to traffic on 17 July 1761 , only 15 months after the enabling Act had been passed , and it was soon being used by the duke 's barges to carry coal to Manchester from his mines at <unk> . The construction of the <unk> excited great admiration , and writers of the day often remarked on the strange and novel sight afforded by the canal where it crossed the <unk> . The structure became one of the wonders of the age and crowds came from all over the country to view it , along with the drilling of the <unk> for the duke 's <unk> navigable levels . Those who saw it were often struck by the advantages of still @-@ water navigation when they saw ten or twelve men slowly <unk> a single barge against the flow of the <unk> , while 40 feet ( 12 m ) above a horse , mule , or perhaps two men , could be seen <unk> several linked barges across the still waters of the <unk> . 
 Although the <unk> was 12 yards ( 11 m ) wide overall , the waterway it carried was only half that width . The <unk> Canal had been built to accommodate the <unk> flat boats then in common use , which had a beam of about 14 feet ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) , making two @-@ way traffic impossible . A <unk> system was therefore installed to control access to the <unk> . A pole 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) high in the centre of the arch at the <unk> bank supported a <unk> system with two arms on each side , operated by <unk> at ground level . 
 Although Gilbert later had to <unk> the <unk> , the structure remained in use for more than 100 years . In the first volume of his Lives of the Engineers ( 1862 ) Scottish author Samuel <unk> said of the construction that " Humble though it now appears , it was parent of the magnificent <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> " . 
 Barton <unk> 's fate was sealed with the passage of the Manchester Ship Canal Act 1885 , which allowed for the construction of a navigable waterway large enough to accommodate ocean @-@ going vessels from the estuary of the River <unk> the 36 miles ( 58 km ) into Manchester , partly along the <unk> . As the arches of the <unk> were too small to allow large ships to pass through it was demolished in 1893 , and replaced by the Barton Swing <unk> still in use today . So <unk> built was the old <unk> that dynamite had to be used to expedite its demolition . 
 Some of the stonework of <unk> 's <unk> has been preserved in the nearby Barton Memorial <unk> , a monument to his " castle in the air " . 
 <unk> Camp is the name of the place where an Iron Age hill fort once stood atop <unk> Hill , which is north of the town of Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare in Somerset , England . This fort was designed for defence , as is evidenced the number of walls and ditches around the site . Archaeologists have found several large triangular platforms around the sides of the fort , lower down on the hillside . They have found nearly one hundred storage pits of various sizes cut into the bedrock , and many of these had human remains , coins , and other artefacts in them . However , in more recent times , the fort has suffered damage and been threatened with complete destruction on multiple occasions . This location has been designated an <unk> Ancient Monument , and it falls within the Weston Woods Local Nature Reserve which was declared to Natural England by North Somerset Council in 2005 . 
 In The Ancient <unk> and Camps of Gloucestershire , Edward J. <unk> mentions that probably either the <unk> or <unk> people initially built <unk> Camp . The <unk> people subsequently <unk> the initial inhabitants and occupied the camp for a time , but they were finally destroyed at the hands of the Romans . 
 <unk> Camp has been explored at various times over a period of 150 years . From 1851 to 1852 , Charles <unk> , Edwin Martin <unk> , and Francis <unk> excavated and surveyed <unk> Camp . <unk> returned in 1880 to continue the excavation , which lasted until 1881 . Another century passed before the <unk> Museum from Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare excavated more of <unk> camp in 1987 to 1988 . Finally , in 1998 , the Avon Extensive Urban Study team performed the latest ( as of 2008 ) assessment of the site . 
 Hill forts developed in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age , roughly the start of the first millennium BC . The reason for their emergence in Britain , and their purpose , has been a subject of debate . It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe , sites built by invaders , or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture . The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain . <unk> of iron ore were located in different places to the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze , and as a result trading patterns shifted and the old <unk> lost their economic and social status . Power passed into the hands of a new group of people . Archaeologist Barry <unk> believes that population increase still played a role and has stated " [ the forts ] provided defensive possibilities for the community at those times when the stress [ of an increasing population ] burst out into open warfare . But I wouldn 't see them as having been built because there was a state of war . They would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed , but this was not the only , or even the most significant , factor in their construction " . 
 The fort is located on the summit of <unk> Hill , 109 metres ( 358 ft ) above sea level . It is in the present @-@ day North Somerset , above the seaside resort of Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare and close to the village of <unk> . 
 Its occupants would have had a view of the countryside as well as any potential invaders . They would have been able to see out over to Sugar <unk> Mountain , the Black Mountains , the Mendip Hills , <unk> <unk> , Sand Point , and Wales . This view is no longer as <unk> as it once was because there are so many trees spread over the hill . 
 Several of them were broken , as though they had been used in the attack [ on the fort ] , as , indeed , many of them probably were . 
 <unk> Hill is bordered on its north and west sides by steep cliffs dropping down into the Bristol Channel between Weston Bay and Sand Bay . These would have rendered the fort nearly <unk> to attack from those directions . Nevertheless , the fort still has one wall on its north side and one on its west side , both very near the edge of the cliffs . On the south side , a single rampart and a ditch guarded the fort . The level east side was protected by two stone <unk> and five ditches . Parts of these <unk> were over 11 metres ( 35 ft ) high measuring from the bottom of the ditch as of 1875 . 
 The walls themselves are around 1 metre ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) thick . However , because they are dry @-@ laid stone , the removal of a few stones would be sufficient to bring the entire wall collapsing down . To prevent access to the walls themselves , the inhabitants of the fort raised large <unk> around the base of the walls by <unk> up rock rubble against the bases . These rubble barriers are over 1 @.@ 22 metres ( 4 @.@ 0 ft ) high , and in places they are over 1 @.@ 22 metres ( 4 @.@ 0 ft ) thick . <unk> would have had to clear away the rubble before being able to attack the wall , and all the while they would be under direct fire from defenders on the top of the wall . 
 Eighteen of these pits were found to contain the remains of human skeletons , which are now stored in the Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare Museum in Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare . Eighteen full skeletons were found , of which ten show evidence of a violent death ( including sword cuts in the skulls ) . It is possible that the Romans or the <unk> raiders attacked the fort and killed the inhabitants . 
 A cast copper alloy penannular collar of special interest to archaeologists has been found at the <unk> . It may indicate that this hilltop site was used even before the Iron Age , since related artefacts tend to be found with Bronze Age items , and it was the first of its type found in Britain . In 2006 , a related copper penannular brooch dating to the 5th or 6th century AD was found in a spring between <unk> <unk> and the Black Mountains in Wales . A gold penannular <unk> was found in the Perry River . 
 Roman coins have been found at <unk> Camp since the Romans had established a presence by the end of the 1st century AD . Many of the Roman coins bear the image of the Western Roman Emperor Honorius . This was inside the fort proper . Another coin was located by Trinity Path which leads towards the fort . 
 Development of Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare since the 19th century has resulted in three episodes of potentially <unk> damage to the site . A quarry started operation in the southern side of <unk> Hill in 1815 to mine for <unk> , calamine , and stone . The Bristol and Exeter Railway arrived in Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare in 1841 , making it profitable to expand the village into a town . In 1842 , Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare became a town with the granting of the <unk> and Market Act of May 1842 . This act also proposed developing houses right over the brow of the hill . This would have gone straight through <unk> Camp ; however , the actual expansion never reached the site . By 1853 , some development had occurred according to the proposed expansion , but it had <unk> the <unk> and continued to the east . 
 In the early 20th century , the <unk> fort itself was damaged by boys rolling stones , including some from the walls of the fort , down the hill on which it stands . The <unk> District of the Somerset Archaeological Society was taking steps to prevent such damage from happening again . 
 Some of the trees planted in the early 19th century had become very large , and their roots were growing into the archaeological structures . In 2005 , the <unk> Commission gave permission for North Somerset Council to fell 300 trees to reduce the subsequent risks . A member of the North Somerset Council , Christopher Richards , said : " If we had a storm up here and these trees came down , then the entire <unk> could be destroyed . " 
 Sir Daniel Michael Blake Day @-@ Lewis ( born 29 April 1957 ) is an English actor . He holds both British and Irish citizenship . Born and raised in London , he excelled on stage at the National Youth Theatre , before being accepted at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School , which he attended for three years . Despite his traditional actor training at the Bristol Old Vic , he is considered to be a method actor , known for his constant devotion to and research of his roles . He often remains completely in character for the duration of the shooting schedules of his films , even to the point of adversely affecting his health . He is one of the most selective actors in the film industry , having starred in only five films since 1998 , with as many as five years between roles . <unk> of his private life , he rarely gives interviews and makes very few public appearances . 
 Day @-@ Lewis shifted between theatre and film for most of the early 1980s , joining the Royal Shakespeare Company and playing Romeo in Romeo and Juliet and <unk> in A Midsummer Night 's Dream , before appearing in the 1984 film The Bounty . He starred in My Beautiful <unk> ( 1985 ) , his first critically acclaimed role , and gained further public notice with A Room with a View ( 1985 ) . He then assumed leading man status with The <unk> <unk> of Being ( 1988 ) . 
 One of the most acclaimed actors of his generation , Day @-@ Lewis has earned numerous awards , including three Academy Awards for Best Actor for his performances in My Left Foot ( 1989 ) , There Will Be Blood ( 2007 ) and Lincoln ( 2012 ) , making him the only male actor in history to have three wins in the lead actor category and one of only three male actors to win three <unk> . He was also nominated in this category for In the Name of the Father ( 1993 ) and <unk> of New York ( 2002 ) . He has also won four BAFTA Awards for Best Actor , three Screen Actors Guild Awards and two Golden Globe Awards . In November 2012 , Time named Day @-@ Lewis the " World 's Greatest Actor . " In June 2014 , he received a knighthood at Buckingham Palace for services to drama . 
 Day @-@ Lewis was born in Kensington , London , the son of poet Cecil Day @-@ Lewis and English actress Jill <unk> . His father , who was born in <unk> , County <unk> , Ireland , was of Protestant Anglo @-@ Irish and English background , lived in England from the age of two , and later became the Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom . Daniel 's mother was Jewish , and his maternal grandparents ' families had emigrated to England from Latvia and Poland . His maternal grandfather , Michael <unk> , an important figure in the history of British cinema , was the head of <unk> Studios . Two years after his birth , the family moved to <unk> 's Hill , Greenwich , south @-@ east London , where Day @-@ Lewis grew up along with his older sister , <unk> , who became a documentary filmmaker and television chef . 
 Living in Greenwich , Day @-@ Lewis found himself among tough South London children , and , being partially Jewish and " <unk> " , he was often bullied . He mastered the local accent and mannerisms and credits that as being his first convincing performance . Later in life , he has been known to speak of himself as very much a <unk> character in his younger years , often in trouble for <unk> and other petty crimes . 
 In 1968 , Day @-@ Lewis ' parents , finding his behaviour to be too wild , sent him to the independent <unk> School in Kent as a <unk> . At the school , he was introduced to his three most prominent interests : <unk> , acting , and fishing . His disdain for the school grew , and after two years at <unk> , he was transferred to another independent school , <unk> in <unk> , Hampshire , which his sister attended , and which had a more relaxed and creative ethos . The transfer led to his film debut at the age of 14 in Sunday Bloody Sunday in which he played a <unk> in an <unk> role . He described the experience as " heaven " , for getting paid £ 2 to <unk> expensive cars parked outside his local church . 
 For a few weeks in 1972 , he and his parents and sister lived at <unk> , the north London home of Kingsley <unk> and Elizabeth Jane Howard . Cecil Day @-@ Lewis had cancer and Howard invited the family to <unk> as a place they could use to rest and <unk> . Cecil died there in May that year . 
 Leaving <unk> in 1975 , Day @-@ Lewis 's unruly attitude had diminished and he needed to make a career choice . Although he had excelled on stage at the National Youth Theatre in London , he applied for a five @-@ year apprenticeship as a cabinet @-@ maker , but was rejected due to lack of experience . He was then accepted at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School , which he attended for three years , eventually performing at the Bristol Old Vic itself . At one point he played <unk> to Pete <unk> , with whom he would later co @-@ star in the film In the Name of the Father . John <unk> , Day @-@ Lewis 's acting teacher at Bristol Old Vic , recalls , " There was something about him even then . He was quiet and polite , but he was clearly focused on his acting – he had a burning quality . He seemed to have something burning beneath the surface . There was a lot going on beneath that quiet appearance . There was one performance in particular , when the students put on a play called Class Energy , when he really seemed to shine – and it became obvious to us , the staff , that we had someone rather special on our hands . " 
 During the early 1980s , Day @-@ Lewis worked in theatre and television including Frost in May ( where he played an <unk> man @-@ child ) and How Many Miles to Babylon ? ( as a World War I officer torn between <unk> to Britain and Ireland ) for the BBC . Eleven years after his film debut , Day @-@ Lewis continued his film career with a small part in Gandhi ( 1982 ) as Colin , a South African street <unk> who racially <unk> the title character , only to be immediately <unk> by his high @-@ strung mother . In late 1982 he had his big theatre break when he took over the lead in Another Country . The following year , he had a supporting role as the conflicted , but ultimately loyal first mate in The Bounty , after which he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company , playing Romeo in Romeo and Juliet and <unk> in A Midsummer Night 's Dream . 
 In 1985 , Day @-@ Lewis gave his first critically acclaimed performance playing a gay man in an <unk> relationship in the film My Beautiful <unk> , set in 1980s London during the period when Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister . Day @-@ Lewis gained further public notice with A Room with a View ( 1985 ) . Set in the <unk> period of turn @-@ of @-@ the @-@ twentieth @-@ century England , he portrayed an entirely different character : Cecil <unk> , the proper upper class fiancé of the main character . In 1987 , Day @-@ Lewis assumed leading man status by starring in Philip Kaufman 's adaptation of Milan <unk> 's The <unk> <unk> of Being , where he portrayed a Czech surgeon whose <unk> sex life is thrown into <unk> when he allows himself to become emotionally involved with a woman . During the eight @-@ month shoot he learned Czech and first began to refuse to break character on or off the set for the entire shooting schedule . During this period , Day @-@ Lewis and other young British actors of the time such as Gary Oldman , Colin Firth , Tim Roth , and Bruce Payne , were dubbed the " <unk> Pack " . 
 Day @-@ Lewis threw his personal version of method acting into full <unk> in 1989 with his performance as Christy Brown in Jim Sheridan 's My Left Foot , which garnered him numerous awards , including the Academy Award for Best Actor and BAFTA Award for Best Actor . Brown , a writer and painter , was born with <unk> <unk> and was only able to control his left foot . Day @-@ Lewis prepared for the role by making frequent visits to <unk> School <unk> in Dublin , where he formed friendships with several people with disabilities , some of whom had no speech . During filming , he refused to break character . Playing a severely <unk> character on screen , off screen Day @-@ Lewis had to be moved around the set in his wheelchair , and crew members would curse at having to lift him over camera and lighting wires , all so that he might gain insight into all aspects of Brown 's life , including the <unk> . Crew members were also required to spoon @-@ feed him . It was rumoured that he had broken two ribs during filming from assuming a <unk> @-@ over position in his wheelchair for so many weeks , something he denied years later at the 2013 Santa Barbara International Film Festival . 
 Day @-@ Lewis returned to the stage in 1989 to work with Richard <unk> , in Hamlet at the National Theatre , London , but collapsed during the scene where the ghost of Hamlet 's father appears before him . He began sobbing <unk> and refused to go back on stage ; he was replaced by Jeremy Northam who finished the performance word @-@ and @-@ action @-@ perfect and received a standing ovation . Ian <unk> then formally replaced Day @-@ Lewis for the rest of the run , except that ill @-@ health forced Northam to stand in again many times . Although the incident was officially attributed to exhaustion , Day @-@ Lewis later claimed to have seen the ghost of his own father . He has not appeared on stage since . The media attention following his breakdown on @-@ stage contributed to his decision to eventually move from England to Ireland in the mid @-@ 1990s to regain a sense of privacy amidst his increasing fame . 
 In 1992 , three years after his Oscar win , The Last of the <unk> was released . Day @-@ Lewis 's character research for this film was well @-@ publicized ; he reportedly underwent <unk> weight training and learned to live off the land and forest where his character lived , camping , hunting and fishing . Day @-@ Lewis also added to his wood @-@ working skills and learned how to make canoes . He carried a long rifle at all times during filming to remain in character and learned how to skin animals . 
 He returned to work with Jim Sheridan on In the Name of the Father , in which he played Gerry <unk> , one of the Guildford Four who were <unk> convicted of a bombing carried out by the Provisional IRA . He lost <unk> for the part , kept his Northern Irish accent on and off the set for the entire shooting schedule , and spent stretches of time in a prison cell . He also insisted that crew members throw cold water at him and verbally abuse him . The film earned him his second Academy Award nomination , third BAFTA nomination , and second Golden Globe nomination . 
 Day @-@ Lewis returned in 1993 , playing <unk> Archer in Martin Scorsese 's adaptation of the Edith <unk> novel The Age of Innocence . To prepare for the film , set in America 's <unk> Age , he wore 1870s @-@ period aristocratic clothing around New York City for two months , including top hat , cane and <unk> . 
 In 1996 , Day @-@ Lewis starred in The <unk> , a film version of the play by Arthur Miller . During the shoot he met his future wife , Rebecca Miller , the author 's daughter . He followed that with Jim Sheridan 's The <unk> as a former boxer and IRA member recently released from prison . His preparation included training with former boxing world champion Barry <unk> , and attending professional boxing matches such as the Nigel Benn vs. Gerald <unk> world title fight at London Arena . 
 Following The <unk> , Day @-@ Lewis took a leave of absence from acting by going into " semi @-@ retirement " and returning to his old passion of <unk> . He moved to Florence , Italy , where he became intrigued by the craft of <unk> , eventually <unk> as a <unk> with <unk> <unk> . For a time his exact whereabouts and actions were not made publicly known . 
 After a five @-@ year absence from filming , Day @-@ Lewis returned to act in <unk> of New York ( 2002 ) , directed by Scorsese and produced by Harvey Weinstein . In his role as the villainous gang leader William " Bill the <unk> " Cutting , he starred alongside Leonardo <unk> , who played Bill 's young protégé . He began his lengthy , self @-@ disciplined process by taking lessons as an apprentice <unk> , hiring a <unk> from <unk> , south London to instruct him in carving up carcasses . He also hired circus performers to teach him to throw knives . While filming , he was never out of character between takes ( including keeping his character 's New York accent ) . At one point during filming , having been diagnosed with pneumonia , he refused to wear a warmer coat or to take treatment because it was not in keeping with the period ; however , he was eventually persuaded to seek medical treatment . His performance in <unk> of New York earned him his third Academy Award nomination and won him his second BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role . 
 After <unk> of New York , Day @-@ Lewis 's wife , director Rebecca Miller offered him the lead role in her film The Ballad of Jack and Rose , in which he played a dying man with regrets over how his life had evolved and over how he had brought up his teenage daughter . During filming he arranged to live separately from his wife to achieve the " isolation " needed to focus on his own character 's reality . The film received mixed reviews . 
 In 2007 , Day @-@ Lewis starred in director Paul Thomas Anderson 's loose adaptation of the <unk> Sinclair novel Oil ! , titled There Will Be Blood . Day @-@ Lewis received the Academy Award for Best Actor , BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role , Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama , Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role ( which he dedicated to Heath Ledger , saying that he was inspired by Ledger 's acting and calling the actor 's performance in <unk> Mountain " unique , perfect " ) , and a variety of film critics ' circle awards for the role . In winning the Best Actor Oscar , Day @-@ Lewis joined Marlon Brando and Jack Nicholson as the only Best Actor winners awarded an Oscar in two non @-@ consecutive decades . 
 In 2009 , Day @-@ Lewis starred in Rob Marshall 's musical adaptation Nine as film director <unk> <unk> . Day @-@ Lewis was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and the <unk> Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role , as well as sharing nominations for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture and the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Cast and the <unk> Award for Best Cast – Motion Picture with the rest of the cast members . 
 Day @-@ Lewis played Abraham Lincoln in Steven Spielberg 's film Lincoln ( 2012 ) . Based on the book Team of <unk> : The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln , the film began shooting in Richmond , Virginia in October 2011 . Day @-@ Lewis spent a year in preparation for the role , a time he had requested from Spielberg . He read over 100 books on Lincoln , and long worked with the makeup artist to achieve a physical likeness to Lincoln . Lincoln received widespread critical acclaim , much of it directed to Day @-@ Lewis ' performance . It also became a commercial success , grossing over $ 275 million worldwide . In November 2012 , Day @-@ Lewis received the BAFTA Britannia Award for Excellence in Film . 
 At the 70th Golden Globe Awards on 14 January 2013 , Day @-@ Lewis won his second Golden Globe Award for Best Actor , and at the <unk> British Academy Film Awards on 10 February , he won his fourth BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role . At the 85th Academy Awards , Day @-@ Lewis became the first three @-@ time recipient of the Best Actor Oscar for his role in Lincoln . 
 John <unk> , Day @-@ Lewis 's acting teacher at Bristol Old Vic theatre school , lauded his achievement , " Although we have quite an impressive alumni – everyone from Jeremy <unk> to Patrick Stewart – I suppose he is now probably the best known , and we 're very proud of all he 's achieved . I certainly hold him up to current students of an example , particularly as an example of how to manage your career with great integrity . He 's never <unk> fame , and as a result he 's never had his private life <unk> upon by the press . He 's clearly not interested in celebrity as such – he 's just interested in his acting . He is still a great craftsman . " Shortly after winning the Oscar for Lincoln , Day @-@ Lewis announced he would be taking a break from acting , retreating back to his Georgian <unk> in County <unk> for the next five years , before making another movie . 
 Day @-@ Lewis rarely discusses his personal life . He had a relationship with French actress <unk> <unk> , which lasted six years and eventually ended after a split and reconciliation . Their son Gabriel @-@ Kane Day @-@ Lewis was born in 1995 in New York City , several months after the relationship ended . 
 In 1996 , while working on the film version of the stage play The <unk> , he visited the home of playwright Arthur Miller where he was introduced to the writer 's daughter , Rebecca Miller . They married later that year . The couple have two sons , <unk> <unk> Day @-@ Lewis ( born 1998 ) and <unk> Blake Day @-@ Lewis ( born 2002 ) and divide their time between their homes in New York City and Ireland . 
 Day @-@ Lewis became an Irish citizen in 1993 and currently holds British and Irish dual citizenship . He has lived in <unk> , County <unk> since 1997 . He stated " I do have dual citizenship , but I think of England as my country . I miss London very much but I couldn 't live there because there came a time when I needed to be private and was forced to be public by the press . I couldn 't deal with it " . He is a supporter of South @-@ East London football club <unk> . 
 On 15 July 2010 , Day @-@ Lewis received an honorary doctorate in letters from the University of Bristol , in part because of his attendance of the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School in his youth . Day @-@ Lewis has stated that he had " no real religious education " and that he " suppose [ s ] " he is " a die @-@ hard agnostic " . In October 2012 , he donated to Oxford University papers belonging to his father , the poet Cecil Day @-@ Lewis , including early drafts of the poet 's work and letters from actor John Gielgud and literary figures such as W. H. <unk> , Robert Graves , and Philip <unk> . In July 2015 , he became the Honorary President of the Poetry Archive . A registered UK charity , the Poetry Archive is a free website containing a growing collection of recordings of English @-@ language poets reading their work . Upon accepting , Day @-@ Lewis commented " I so admire what you ’ re doing with the Poetry Archive and I ’ m very happy that you ’ ve invited me to be involved with it . " 
 In June 2014 , Day @-@ Lewis was made a Knight Bachelor in the 2014 <unk> Honours for services to drama . When , in 2008 , he received the Academy Award for Best Actor from Helen <unk> ( who was on presenting duty having won the previous year 's Best Actress Oscar for playing Queen Elizabeth II in The Queen ) Day @-@ Lewis <unk> before her and she <unk> him on each shoulder with the Oscar <unk> , to which he <unk> ; " That 's the closest I 'll come to ever getting a knighthood " . In November 2014 , Day @-@ Lewis was formally knighted by Prince William , Duke of Cambridge at Buckingham Palace . 
 <unk> is a para @-@ <unk> and para @-@ Nordic sit skiing sport class , a classification defined by the International Paralympic Committee ( IPC for people with <unk> in the lower <unk> and people with <unk> <unk> that affects the lower half of the body . Outside of skiing , the competitor in this class is unable to walk . For international competitions , classification is done through IPC <unk> <unk> or IPC Nordic <unk> . For sub @-@ international competitions , classification is done by a national federation such as <unk> Canada . 
 Generally to be eligible for a sit @-@ skiing classification , a <unk> needs to meet a minimum of one of several conditions including a single below knee but above ankle <unk> , <unk> that exhibits similar to below knee <unk> , legs of different length where there is at least a 7 centimetres ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) difference , combined muscle strength in the lower <unk> less than 71 . 
 The International Paralympic Committee ( IPC ) defines this para @-@ <unk> classification as " a . Athletes with disabilities in the lower limbs and a fair sitting balance b . <unk> with disabilities in lower <unk> " In 2002 , the Australian Paralympic Committee defined this classification for para @-@ <unk> as a sit skiing classification for " athletes with disabilities in their lower limbs and fair sitting balance . " The IPC defines this class for para @-@ Nordic skiing as for " those with <unk> in the lower limbs and trunk . The athlete retains the use of abdominal muscles and trunk <unk> muscles , especially those muscle <unk> to the <unk> . " Cross Country Canada described this para @-@ Nordic classification as " <unk> in the lower limbs and trunk with fair upper abdominal and trunk muscle activity with some functional sitting balance . <unk> is unable to stand . " 
 For international para @-@ <unk> skiing competitions , classification is done through IPC <unk> <unk> . A national federation such as <unk> Canada handles classification for domestic competitions . For para @-@ Nordic skiing events , classification is handled by IPC Nordic <unk> Technical Committee on the international level and by the national sports federation such as Cross @-@ Country Canada on a country by country level . When being assessed into this classification , a number of things are considered including reviewing the <unk> medical history and medical information on the <unk> 's disability , having a physical and an in person assessment of the <unk> training or competing . During the assessment process , a testing board is used for this classification with six different tests being conducted that look for balance on different planes and to test for upper body strength and levels of mobility . The <unk> scores for people to be assessed in this classification are 9 - 15 . 
 The IPC defines this class for para @-@ Nordic skiing as for " with <unk> in the lower limb ( s ) and the trunk . Athletes have near normal trunk muscles activation . " Cross Country Canada defined this para @-@ Nordic classification as " <unk> in the lower limbs and trunk . With good upper abdominal and trunk muscle activity and good sitting balance . <unk> may be able to stand " in 2012 . <unk> in this class may be able to " stand or walk with or without aid of <unk> " . They may also have Grade 2 or less hip extension . 
 In learning to <unk> , one of the first skills learned is getting into and out of the <unk> , and how to position the body in the <unk> in order to maintain balance . The <unk> then learns how to fall and to get up . The <unk> then works with the instructor on learning to <unk> on flat terrain , with the purpose of this exercise being to learn how to use the <unk> . The <unk> next learns how to get into and out of a <unk> . After this , the <unk> learns how to make basic turns , edging , medium radius turns and advance skiing techniques . 
 The <unk> method has been criticized not only because there is no good evidence it works , but also because it can have negative consequences for those who attempt to follow it : they might damage their eyes through <unk> of their eyes to sunlight , put themselves and others at risk by not wearing their <unk> lenses while driving , or neglect conventional eye care , possibly allowing serious conditions to develop . 
 <unk> is the process by which the eye increases optical power to maintain focus on the <unk> while shifting its gaze to a closer point . The long @-@ standing medical consensus is that this is accomplished by action of the <unk> muscle , a muscle within the eye , which <unk> the <unk> of the eye 's crystalline lens . This explanation is based in the observed effect of <unk> temporarily preventing accommodation when applied to the <unk> muscle , as well as images reflected on the crystalline lens becoming smaller as the eye shifts focus to a closer point , indicating a change in the lens ' shape . <unk> rejected this explanation , and in his 1920 book presented photographs that he said showed that the image remained the same size even as the eye shifted focus , concluding from this that the lens was not a factor in accommodation . However , <unk> Philip <unk> in a 1956 work characterized these photographs as " so blurred that it is impossible to tell whether one image is larger than the other " , in contrast to later photographs that clearly showed a change in the size of the reflected images , just as had been observed since the late nineteenth century . 
 Laboratory tests have shown that the human <unk> is far too rigid to spontaneously change shape to a degree that would be necessary to accomplish what <unk> described . <unk> small changes in axial length of the <unk> ( 18 @.@ 6 – 19 @.@ 2 micrometres ) are caused by the action of the <unk> muscle during accommodation . However , these changes are far too small to account for the necessary changes in focus , producing changes of only − 0 @.@ <unk> <unk> . 
 <unk> felt that <unk> lenses , which he characterized as " eye crutches " , are an <unk> to <unk> poor vision . In his view , " strain " would increase as the eyes adjust to the correction in front of them . He thus recommended that glasses be discarded by anyone applying his method . 
 In his writings , <unk> discussed several techniques that he claimed helped patients to improve their sight . He wrote " The ways in which people strain to see are infinite , and the methods used to relieve the strain must be almost equally varied , " emphasizing that no single approach would work for everyone . His techniques were all designed to help <unk> this " strain " from seeing and thereby achieve " central <unk> " , or seeing what is in the central point of vision without staring . He asserted that " all errors of refraction and all functional disturbances of the eye disappear when it sees by central <unk> " and that other conditions were often relieved as well . 
 <unk> suggested closing the eyes for minutes at a time to help bring about relaxation . He asserted that the relaxation could be deepened in most cases by " <unk> " , or covering the closed eyes with the <unk> of the hands , without putting pressure on the <unk> . If the covered eyes did not strain , he said , they would see " a field so black that it is impossible to remember , imagine , or see anything <unk> " , since light was excluded by the <unk> . However , he reported that some of his patients experienced " illusions of lights and colors " sometimes amounting to " <unk> appearances " as they " <unk> " , occurrences he attributed to his ubiquitous " strain " and that he claimed disappeared when one truly relaxed . This phenomenon , however , was almost certainly caused by <unk> or " dark light " . In fact , even in conditions of perfect darkness , as inside a cave , neurons at every level of the visual system produce random background activity that is interpreted by the brain as patterns of light and color . 
 <unk> placed importance on mental images , as he felt relaxation was the key to clarity of imagination as well as of actual sight . He claimed that one 's poise could be <unk> by the visual memory of black ; that the darker it appeared in the mind , and the smaller the area of black that could be imagined , the more relaxed one was at the moment . He recommended that patients think of the top letter from an eye chart and then visualize progressively smaller black letters , and eventually a period or comma . But he emphasized his view that the clear visual memory of black " cannot be attained by any sort of effort " , stating that " the memory is not the cause of the relaxation , but must be preceded by it , " and cautioned against " concentrating " on black , as he regarded an attempt to " think of one thing only " as a strain . 
 While <unk> preferred to have patients imagine something black , he also reported that some found objects of other colors <unk> to visualize , and thus were benefited most by remembering those , because , he asserted , " the memory can never be perfect unless it is easy . " <unk> reason that the only benefit to eyesight gained from such techniques is itself imagined , and point out that familiar objects , including letters on an eye chart , can be recognized even when they appear less than clear . 
 He thought that the manner of eye movement affected the sight . He suggested " shifting " , or moving the eyes back and forth to get an illusion of objects " swinging " in the opposite direction . He believed that the smaller the area over which the " swing " was experienced , the greater was the benefit to sight . He also indicated that it was usually helpful to close the eyes and imagine something " swinging " . By alternating actual and mental shifting over an image , <unk> wrote , many patients were quickly able to shorten the " shift " to a point where they could " conceive and swing a letter the size of a period in a newspaper " . One who mastered this would attain the " universal swing " , <unk> believed . 
 Perhaps finding <unk> ' concepts of " shifting " and " swinging " too complicated , some proponents of vision improvement , such as <unk> <unk> , suggested simply moving the eyes up and down , from side to side , and shifting one 's gaze between a near @-@ point and a far @-@ point . 
 <unk> believed that the eyes were benefited by exposure to sunlight . He stated that " persons with normal sight can look directly at the sun , or at the strongest artificial light , without injury or discomfort , " and gave several examples of patients ' vision purportedly improving after <unk> – this is at <unk> with the well @-@ known risk of eye damage that can result from direct sunlight observation . 
 <unk> cautioned that , just as one should not attempt to run a marathon without training , one should not immediately look directly at the sun , but he suggested that it could be worked up to . He acknowledged that looking at the sun could have ill effects , but characterized them as being " always temporary " and in fact the effects of strain in response to sunlight . He wrote that he had cured people who believed that the sun had caused them permanent eye damage . In his magazine , <unk> later suggested exposing only the white part of the <unk> to direct sunlight , and only for seconds at a time , after allowing the sun to shine on closed eyelids for a longer period . 
 <unk> publications of <unk> ' book omitted mention of the supposed benefits from direct sunlight shining on open eyes . 
 <unk> ' techniques have never been scientifically established to improve eyesight . Several of <unk> ' techniques , including " <unk> " , " swinging " , and " <unk> " , were combined with healthy changes to diet and exercise in a 1983 randomized controlled trial of <unk> children in India . After 6 months , the experimental groups " did not show any statistically significant difference in <unk> status " , though the children in the treatment group " <unk> … felt relieved of eye strain and other symptoms " . 
 In 1967 the British Medical Journal observed that " <unk> [ … ] advocated prolonged sun @-@ <unk> as the treatment of <unk> , with disastrous results . " 
 The philosopher Frank J. <unk> has argued that the method <unk> described would be difficult to test scientifically due to his emphasis on relaxation and <unk> . <unk> asked " How can we tell whether someone has relaxed or imagined something , or just thinks that he or she has imagined it ? " In regards to the possibility of a <unk> trial , <unk> commented " I cannot conceive of how we could put someone in a situation where he thinks he has imagined something while we know that he has not . " 
 After <unk> died in 1931 , his methods of treatment were continued by his widow Emily and other associates , some of whom incorporated exercises and dietary recommendations . Most subsequent proponents did not stand by <unk> ' explanation of how the eye focuses <unk> , but nonetheless maintained that relieving a <unk> " strain " was the key to improving sight . 
 Margaret <unk> Corbett first met <unk> when she consulted him about her husband 's eyesight . She became his pupil , and eventually taught his method at her School of Eye Education in Los Angeles . She was of the stated belief that " the <unk> <unk> is really part of the brain , and vision is nine @-@ tenths mental and one @-@ tenth only physical . " 
 In late 1940 , Corbett and her assistant were charged with violations of the Medical Practice Act of California for treating eyes without a licence . At the trial , many of her students testified on her behalf , describing in detail how she had enabled them to <unk> their glasses . One witness testified that he had been almost blind from <unk> , but that , after working with Corbett , his vision had improved to such an extent that for the first time he could read for eight hours at a stretch without glasses . Corbett explained in court that she was <unk> neither <unk> nor <unk> and represented herself not as a doctor but only as an " instructor of eye training " . Describing her method she said " We turn vision on by teaching the eyes to shift . We want the sense of motion to relieve staring , to end the fixed look . We use light to <unk> the eyes and to <unk> them to the sun . " 
 The trial attracted widespread interest , as did the " not guilty " verdict . The case spurred a bill in the Californian State Legislature that would have then made such vision education illegal without an <unk> or medical licence . After a lively campaign in the media , the bill was rejected . 
 In 1939 , at the age of 45 and with eyesight that continued to deteriorate , he happened to hear of the <unk> method and sought the help of Margaret Corbett , who gave him regular lessons . Three years later he wrote The Art of Seeing , in which he related : " Within a couple of months I was reading without <unk> and , what was better still , without strain and fatigue .... At the present time , my vision , though very far from normal , is about twice as good as it used to be when I wore <unk> . " Describing the process , <unk> wrote that " Vision is not won by making an effort to get it : it comes to those who have learned to put their minds and eyes into a state of alert <unk> , of dynamic relaxation . " He expressed indifference regarding the <unk> of <unk> ' explanation of how the eye focuses , stating that " my concern is not with the anatomical mechanism of accommodation , but with the art of seeing . " 
 His case generated wide publicity as well as scrutiny . <unk> Walter B. Lancaster , for example , suggested in 1944 that <unk> had " learned how to use what he has to better advantage " by training the " <unk> part of seeing " , rather than actually improving the quality of the image on the <unk> . 
 In 1952 , ten years after writing The Art of Seeing , <unk> spoke at a Hollywood banquet , wearing no glasses and , according to Bennett <unk> , apparently reading his paper from the <unk> without difficulty . In <unk> 's words : 
 Then suddenly he <unk> — and the disturbing truth became obvious . He wasn 't reading his address at all . He had learned it by heart . To <unk> his memory he brought the paper closer and closer to his eyes . When it was only an inch or so away he still couldn 't read it , and had to fish for a <unk> glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him . It was an <unk> moment . 
 In response to this , <unk> wrote " I often do use <unk> glasses where conditions of light are bad , and have never claimed to be able to read except under very good conditions . " This <unk> that he had not regained anything close to normal vision , and in fact never claimed that he had . 
 " Natural vision correction " or " natural vision improvement " continues to be marketed by practitioners offering individual instruction , many of who have no medical or <unk> credentials . Most base their approach in the <unk> method , though some also integrate vision therapy techniques . There are also many self @-@ help books and programs , which have not been subjected to randomized controlled trials , aimed at improving eyesight naturally . <unk> of such approaches argue that they lack the funds to formally test them . 
 The heavily advertised " See <unk> Method " ( of which sales were halted by a court order in November 2006 , in response to what were found to be dishonest marketing practices ) included " <unk> " and " light therapy " , both adapted from <unk> . The creators of the program , however , emphasized that they did not endorse <unk> ' approach overall . 
 In his 1992 book The <unk> Method , A Complete Guide to <unk> <unk> — Naturally , " <unk> method teacher " Peter Mansfield was very critical of eye care professionals for <unk> <unk> lenses , recommending most of <unk> ' techniques to improve vision . The book included accounts of twelve " real cases " , but did not report any information about <unk> error . 
 Czech native John <unk> claims to have created an " eye cure " that improves eyesight in three days , <unk> from ancient <unk> eye exercises , <unk> from the Seth Material , and the <unk> method . Although he has <unk> from his neighbor and others , several of his students indicate that he has greatly exaggerated their cases . <unk> 's self @-@ published manual , <unk> for the Eyes , was rejected by an <unk> who evaluated it , and <unk> no interest from the World Health Organization and St. Erik 's Eye Foundation in Sweden as he had not conducted double @-@ blind tests . 
 In support of the effectiveness of the <unk> method , proponents point to the many accounts of people allegedly having improved their eyesight by applying it . While these anecdotes may be told and passed on in good faith , several potential explanations exist for the phenomena reported other than a genuine reversal of a <unk> error due to the techniques practiced : 
 Some cases of <unk> are recognized as due to a transient <unk> of the <unk> muscle , rather than a <unk> <unk> . These are classed as <unk> , of which spontaneous reversal may account for some reports of improvement . 
 Research has confirmed that when <unk> subjects remove their <unk> lenses , over time there is a limited improvement ( termed " blur adaptation " ) in their unaided visual resolution , even though refraction indicates no corresponding change in <unk> error . This is believed to occur due to adjustments made in the visual system . One who has been <unk> <unk> ' techniques and notices such improvement may not realize that simply leaving the glasses off would have had the same effect , which may be especially pronounced if the <unk> was too strong to begin with . 
 Visual <unk> is affected by the size of the pupil . When it <unk> ( such as in response to an increase in light ) , the quality of focus will improve significantly , at the cost of a reduced ability to see in dim light . This is known as the " <unk> effect " . This concept is also used in photography when changing the <unk> size . 
 Some eye defects may naturally change for the better with age or in cycles ( <unk> Stewart Duke @-@ Elder suggested that this is what happened with <unk> <unk> ) . A <unk> when first setting in sometimes results in much improved eyesight for a short time . One who happens to have been <unk> the <unk> method will likely credit it for any improvement experienced regardless of the actual cause . 
 Some studies have suggested that a learned ability to interpret blurred images may account for perceived improvements in eyesight . <unk> Walter B. Lancaster had this to say : " Since seeing is only partly a matter of the image on the <unk> and the sensation it produces , but is in still larger part a matter of the <unk> processes of synthesis , in which memories play a principal role , it follows that by repetition , by practice , by exercises , one builds up a <unk> of memories useful for the interpretation of sensations and facilitates the syntheses which are the major part of seeing . " Lancaster faulted <unk> in general for <unk> the role of the brain in the process of seeing , " leaving to irregular , half @-@ trained workers the cultivation of that field " . 
 A 1952 study involving 100 subjects claiming to experience " flashes " of clear vision , in which eyesight momentarily becomes much sharper , found only one subject who " demonstrated unusually good transient <unk> ( a flash ) but she was unable to maintain it or repeat it for measurement of refraction " and concluded that " ' <unk> ' ( those who can obtain remarkably large transient increases in visual <unk> ) are uncommon " . A 2004 study proposed that such flashes may be caused by " negative accommodation " ( i.e. an active flattening of the lens by the <unk> muscles ) . 
 A 1982 study of subjects who underwent computer @-@ based visual training concluded that any perceived resulting improvement in visual <unk> is best explained as a contact lens @-@ like effect of moisture on the eye , based on increased tear action exhibited by 15 out of 17 subjects who experienced such improvement . 
 A 2003 study of claims that " positive suggestion ( e.g. , using hypnosis ) can significantly improve visual <unk> " found that " neither suggestion nor hypnotic phenomena are likely to significantly improve <unk> vision " . 
 In 2005 the <unk> Department of New Zealand 's <unk> Hospital published a review of forty @-@ three studies regarding the use of eye exercises . They found that " As yet there is no clear scientific evidence published in the mainstream literature supporting the use of eye exercises " to improve visual <unk> , and concluded that " their use therefore remains controversial . " 
 A frequent criticism of the <unk> method is that it has remained relatively obscure , which is seen as proof that it is not truly effective . Writer Alan M. <unk> concluded in a 1979 article that the " most telling argument against the <unk> system " and other alternative <unk> was that they " bore no fruit " . In regards to the <unk> method , he reasoned that " If <unk> , shifting , and swinging could really cure poor eyesight , glasses would be as obsolete by now as horse @-@ drawn carriages . " 
 <unk> one 's <unk> lenses , as <unk> recommended , or wearing lenses weaker than one 's prescribed correction , as some <unk> method advocates suggest , poses a potential safety hazard in certain situations , especially when one is operating a motor vehicle . James <unk> related that his father , shortly after discarding glasses on the advice of <unk> ' book , wrecked his car . <unk> method teachers often caution that when driving , one should wear the correction legally required . 
 One of the greatest potential dangers of faith in the <unk> method is that a believer may be <unk> to seek medical advice regarding what could be a sight @-@ threatening condition requiring prompt treatment , such as <unk> . Also , children with vision problems may require early attention by a professional in order to successfully prevent lazy eye . Such treatment may include exercises , but which are different from those associated with the <unk> method , and parents who <unk> to <unk> ' ideas may delay seeking conventional care until it is too late .

 Maneater is a 2007 American television natural horror film directed by Gary <unk> and produced by <unk> Entertainment , starring Gary <unk> , <unk> Wood , and Ian D. Clark . The film aired on various video on demand channels , before officially <unk> in the United States on the Syfy Channel on September 8 , 2007 . This film lends its name to the film series to which it belongs and is the third film in the series . Filmed in Winnipeg , Manitoba , Canada , the film is produced under an agreement with Syfy . Based on Jack Warner 's novel <unk> , the film details the killing <unk> of an escaped Bengal tiger after it gets loose in a small town along the Appalachian Trail . <unk> to stop it are Sheriff Barnes ( <unk> ) and big game hunter Colonel Graham ( Clark ) , while a young boy named Roy ( Wood ) who has a strange connection to the tiger , tries to save it . It is the 4th film in the Maneater Series . 
 Maneater is one of the few films in the series to break the standard formula of Syfy natural horror films with its use of a normal , living tiger rather than a CG animal or <unk> its behavior by having it be a mutant or genetically altered . Critics heavily panned the film citing <unk> acting , heavy use of stereotypical characters , a hole @-@ filled plot , unused subplots , and the use of a live tiger resulting in almost all attacks being implied rather than seen . 
 Two people disappear along the Appalachian Trail : a young man <unk> with his girlfriend and a <unk> who rarely leaves his home . Sheriff Grady Barnes ( Gary <unk> ) finds a trail in the woods which leads him to parts of the <unk> 's body . That night , young Roy <unk> ( <unk> Wood ) is reading by <unk> when a Bengal tiger briefly appears in front of his bedroom window . In the morning , his mother , Rose ( Marina <unk> Kerr ) , finds him <unk> in the woods in front of their house . A cast taken at the next victim 's scene points to a tiger as the <unk> 's killer , so Sheriff Barnes holds a press conference to warn the public . The Bengal Tiger visits Roy 's home again that night . 
 A tabloid paper offers a $ 10 @,@ 000 reward for the tiger causing the town to be inundated with hunters and reporters . The sheriff forbids anyone from going in the woods and hunting the tiger , but while out with Deputy Sharon <unk> ( Sarah <unk> ) , he sees Roy in the woods . They give chase , but instead find a dead tabloid reporter . The National Guard is called in to help . The sheriff later sees Roy in the woods again and warns him to stay out before taking him home and giving Rose the same warning . After he leaves , she mistakenly believes Roy told the sheriff lies about there being a tiger and <unk> him . 
 Later , at another press conference , a reporter reveals that Graham was exiled from India , his former home , after he failed to kill a tiger that <unk> over 200 people . The sheriff visits Graham that night and he explains that the situation had been beyond his control . Later that night , Roy dreams the tiger killed Graham and runs to his tent to check on him . Graham offers to walk him home , but they end up going to the store where Rose works when Roy says she is working late . 
 When they arrive , the Tiger attacks and kills her . They run into the store , but are separated . Graham calls for Roy , but the Tiger gets into the building and attacks him , Graham barely failing to kill the tiger with both shots he fires . Sheriff Barnes arrives after being alerted about a break @-@ in alarm and is chased into the store by the tiger . He finds Graham 's hat and a blood trail and tries to find him before hearing Roy calling out from under a truck outside . The sheriff dives under the truck and shields the boy as the Tiger tries to attack . When the Tiger jumps into the bed of the truck , they run to the sheriff 's truck . The sheriff shoots at the tiger , but hits a gasoline tank causing it to explode and kill the Tiger . Graham appears beside the building , bloody but alive . <unk> his hunting days are over , Graham returns home . Sheriff Barnes and his wife adopt the orphaned Roy . 
 In October 2006 , <unk> Entertainment made a deal with the Sci Fi Channel to produce a series of ten made @-@ for @-@ television natural horror films to air on the network the following year . Though the film series was dubbed " Maneater " by <unk> Entertainment , the actual Maneater film is the third in the series . Although the agreement called for the films to premiere on Sci Fi , the first six films in the series actually premiered on various video on demand channels months ahead of their Sci Fi <unk> . 
 Based on Jack Warner 's 2003 debut novel <unk> , Maneater was filmed in Winnipeg , Manitoba , Canada . The film uses no CGI special effects at all , with the " killer tiger " portrayed by actual trained tigers . In scenes where the tiger is chasing various characters , the tiger is actually on a <unk> with his trainer behind him . The <unk> and trainer were edited out of the scenes during post @-@ production . While Gary <unk> said the tigers were a " joy " to work with , Clark joked that he was hoping they would not think he was lunch , noting that it was his first time working with tigers . 
 Maneater premiered in Canada on the subscription @-@ based video on demand channel Movie Central on <unk> earlier in 2007 before it aired in the United States on the Sci Fi Channel on September 8 , 2007 as its Saturday night " Movie of the Week " premiere . On January 8 , 2008 , Genius Entertainment released the film on DVD . It included no extras , an <unk> widescreen transfer , and a <unk> Digital 5 @.@ 1 audio track . The film was re @-@ released on July 22 , 2008 as part of the first volume of the " Maneater Series Collection " sets . The volume also included Blood Monkey and In the <unk> 's Web , the first and second films in the series , respectively . 
 SM U @-@ 41 or U @-@ <unk> was a U @-@ 27 class U @-@ boat or submarine for the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy . U @-@ 41 , built by the Austrian firm of <unk> <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) at the Pola Navy Yard , was launched in November 1917 . When she was commissioned in February 1918 , she became the last boat of her class to enter service . She was also the last domestically constructed Austro @-@ Hungarian U @-@ boat to enter service . 
 She had a single hull just over 122 feet ( 37 m ) in length . She displaced 280 metric tons ( 276 long tons ) when surfaced and over 325 metric tons ( 320 long tons ) when submerged . Her two diesel engines moved her at up to 9 knots ( 17 km / h ) on the surface , while her twin electric <unk> propelled her at up to 7 @.@ 5 knots ( 13 @.@ 9 km / h ) while underwater . She was armed with two bow torpedo tubes and could carry a load of up to four torpedoes . She was also equipped with a 75 mm ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) deck gun and a machine gun . 
 During a short service career marred by repeated engine <unk> , U @-@ 41 sank one ship , the French steamer <unk> <unk> of 4 @,@ <unk> gross register tons ( <unk> ) . U @-@ 41 was at Cattaro at war 's end , and was ceded to France as a war reparation in 1920 . She was towed to <unk> and broken up within a year . 
 Austria @-@ Hungary 's U @-@ boat fleet was largely obsolete at the outbreak of World War I. The Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy satisfied its most urgent needs by purchasing five Type <unk> I submarines that comprised the U @-@ 10 class from Germany , by raising and <unk> the sunken French submarine <unk> as U @-@ 14 , and by building four submarines of the U @-@ 20 class that were based on the 1911 Danish <unk> class . 
 Once these steps had <unk> their most urgent needs , the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy selected the German Type <unk> II design for its newest submarines in mid 1915 . The Germans were reluctant to <unk> any of their wartime resources to Austro @-@ Hungarian construction , but were willing to sell plans for up to six of the <unk> II boats to be constructed under license in Austria @-@ Hungary . The Navy agreed to the proposal and purchased the plans from AG <unk> of <unk> , one of the two German shipyards building <unk> II submarines . 
 U @-@ 41 displaced 280 metric tons ( 276 long tons ) surfaced and 326 metric tons ( 321 long tons ) submerged . She had a single hull with saddle tanks , and was planned to be 121 feet 1 inch ( 36 @.@ 91 m ) long with a beam of 14 feet 4 inches ( 4 @.@ 37 m ) and a draft of 12 feet 2 inches ( 3 @.@ 71 m ) . For propulsion , she had two shafts , twin diesel engines of 270 <unk> ( 200 kW ) for surface running , and twin electric <unk> of 280 shp ( 210 kW ) for submerged travel . She was capable of 9 knots ( 16 @.@ 7 km / h ) while surfaced and 7 @.@ 5 knots ( 13 @.@ 9 km / h ) while submerged . Although there is no specific <unk> of a range for U @-@ 41 in Conway 's All the World 's Fighting Ships , 1906 – 1921 , the German <unk> II boats , upon which the U @-@ 27 class was based , had a range of over 6 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 11 @,@ 000 km ) at 5 knots ( 9 @.@ 3 km / h ) surfaced , and 45 nautical miles ( 83 km ) at 4 knots ( 7 @.@ 4 km / h ) submerged . U @-@ 27 @-@ class boats were designed for a crew of 23 – 24 . 
 U @-@ 41 was armed with two 45 cm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) bow torpedo tubes and could carry a complement of four torpedoes . She was also equipped with a 75 mm / 26 ( 3 @.@ 0 in ) deck gun and an 8 mm ( 0 @.@ 31 in ) machine gun . 
 U @-@ 41 was ordered from <unk> <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) as a replacement for U @-@ 6 ( which had been sunk in May 1916 ) . She was laid down on 23 February 1917 at the Pola Navy Yard . During construction , U @-@ 41 was lengthened by nearly 30 centimetres ( 12 in ) to accommodate diesel engines that had been ordered for U @-@ 6 before her loss . U @-@ 41 was launched on 11 November . 
 On 19 February 1918 , SM U @-@ 41 was commissioned into the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy under the command of <unk> Edgar Wolf . Previously in command of U @-@ 4 for a week in April 1915 , the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Wolf was a native of <unk> ( present @-@ day <unk> , Croatia ) . When she entered service , U @-@ 41 was the last boat of her class to do so . She was also the last domestically constructed U @-@ boat completed and commissioned into the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy . Wolf and U @-@ 41 departed Pola on 17 March for a patrol in the Mediterranean . On 30 March , Wolf attempted to torpedo a steamer off the coast of Africa , but missed his target . Three days later , the left diesel engine failed and Wolf steered his boat back to port , arriving at Cattaro on 5 April . U @-@ 41 sailed for Pola on 9 April and , completing the journey two days later , underwent repairs over the next six weeks . While conducting a diving trial out of Pola on 25 May , the boat <unk> a leak at the depth of 50 metres ( 160 ft ) . She returned to Pola and underwent more extensive repairs , remaining there until August . 
 After making way to the submarine base at <unk> , U @-@ 41 set out on another patrol into the Mediterranean on 29 August , but put into <unk> the next day for engine repairs . <unk> her patrol after a day 's delay , U @-@ 41 reached her patrol area east of Malta . Wolf and U @-@ 41 scored their first success on 13 September , when they torpedoed and sank the steamer <unk> <unk> west of <unk> . The 4 @,@ <unk> @-@ ton French ship was carrying horses and a general cargo from <unk> for <unk> when she was attacked . Six were killed in the attack on the French ship . On 26 September , U @-@ 41 attacked another steamer west of <unk> , but was apparently unsuccessful . U @-@ 41 ended her patrol at Cattaro on 28 September . 
 On October 6 , Wolf and U @-@ 41 set out from Cattaro to patrol off <unk> and the <unk> coast . After nine days without success , the boat returned to Cattaro , and remained there through the end of the war . On 1 November , U @-@ 41 was taken over by a British commission , who controlled the vessel until she was ceded to France as a war reparation in 1920 . U @-@ 41 and sister boats U @-@ 29 and U @-@ 31 were towed to <unk> . U @-@ 29 <unk> en route , but U @-@ 31 and U @-@ 41 reached their destination and were scrapped within the next year . 
 Hurricane Carla ranks as the most intense U.S. tropical cyclone landfall on the Hurricane <unk> Index . The third named storm and first Category 5 hurricane of the 1961 Atlantic hurricane season , Carla developed from an area of <unk> weather in the southwestern Caribbean Sea on September 3 . Initially a tropical depression , it strengthened slowly while heading northwestward , and by September 5 , the system was upgraded to Tropical Storm Carla . About 24 hours later , Carla was upgraded to a hurricane . Shortly thereafter , the storm curved northward while approaching the Yucatán Channel . Late on September 7 , Carla entered the Gulf of Mexico while passing just northeast of the Yucatán Peninsula . By early on the following day , the storm became a major hurricane after reaching Category 3 intensity . <unk> its northwestward course , Carla continued intensification and on September 11 , it was upgraded to a Category 5 hurricane . Later that day , Carla weakened slightly , but was still a large and intense hurricane when the storm made landfall near Port O 'Connor , Texas . It weakened quickly inland and was reduced to a tropical storm on September 12 . Heading generally northward , Carla transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September 13 , while centered over southern Oklahoma . Rapidly moving northeastward , Carla 's remnants reached the <unk> Sea , Canada and dissipated on September 17 , 1961 . 
 While crossing the Yucatán Channel , the outer bands of Carla brought gusty winds and severe local flooding in western Cuba and the Yucatán Peninsula , though no damage or fatalities were reported . Although initially considered a significant threat to Florida , the storm brought only light winds and small amounts of precipitation , reaching no more than 3 @.@ 15 in ( 80 mm ) . In Texas , wind gusts as high as 170 mph ( 280 km / h ) were observed in Port <unk> . Additionally , several tornadoes spawned in the state caused notable impacts , with the most destructive <unk> resulting in 200 buildings severely damaged , of which at least 60 were destroyed , and 8 deaths and 55 injuries . Throughout the state , Carla destroyed 1 @,@ <unk> homes , 568 farm buildings , and 415 other buildings . Additionally , 50 @,@ <unk> homes , 5 @,@ 620 farm buildings , and 10 @,@ <unk> other buildings suffered damage . There were 34 fatalities and at least $ 300 million ( 1961 USD ) in losses in Texas alone . Several tornadoes also touched down in Louisiana , causing the destruction of 140 homes and 11 farms and other buildings , and major damage to 231 additional homes and 11 farm and other buildings . Minor to moderate damage was also reported to <unk> homes and 75 farm and other buildings . Six deaths and $ 25 million in losses in Louisiana were attributed to Carla . Heavy rainfall occurred in several other states , especially in Kansas , where flash flooding severely damaged crops and drowned 5 people . Overall , Carla resulted in $ 325 @.@ 74 million in losses and 43 fatalities . 
 As early as September 1 , a tropical disturbance – an area of convective activity – was observed tracking westward across the Caribbean Sea within the Intertropical Convergence Zone ( ITCZ ) . Around that time , an anticyclone was situated over the western Caribbean Sea at the upper @-@ tropospheric levels . Surface charts indicate that a low @-@ level circulation was developing early on September 3 . Thus , it is estimated that a tropical depression – a tropical cyclone with sustained winds with winds of less than 39 mph ( 63 km / h ) – developed about 175 miles ( <unk> km ) northwest of <unk> , Colombia at 1200 UTC . Initially , the center of circulation remained difficult to locate on surface charts due to lack of data . At San <unk> , winds shifted west at about 12 mph ( 19 km / h ) , while barometric pressures dropped to 1 @,@ <unk> mbar ( 29 @.@ 7 inHg ) . The Weather Bureau Office in Miami , Florida issued its first <unk> at 1600 UTC on September 4 , while the depression was centered about 250 miles ( 400 km ) east @-@ southeast of Cabo <unk> a <unk> , Nicaragua . 
 It is estimated that sustained winds reached 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) at 1200 UTC on September 5 , thus the depression strengthened into a tropical storm and was named Carla , while located just northeast of Cabo <unk> a <unk> . A reconnaissance aircraft flight reported that Carla was continuing to intensify , with surface winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) . <unk> reported an unusually large tropical cyclone , with convective bands extending about 520 miles ( 840 km ) outward from the center . Around 0000 UTC on September 6 , Carla passed near Swan Island , which reported a barometric pressure of about 995 mbar ( 29 @.@ 4 inHg ) and wind gusts of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) from the southwest . Based on observations obtained by a reconnaissance aircraft at 1100 UTC on September 6 – namely a barometric pressure of <unk> mbar ( 29 @.@ 0 inHg ) – a <unk> issued by the Weather Bureau an hour later indicated that the storm had " probably reached hurricane intensity " . According to post @-@ season analysis , Carla reached hurricane status at that time . 
 Shortly after becoming a hurricane on September 6 , Carla curved northward in the northwestern Caribbean Sea . At 1200 UTC on September 7 , the storm intensified into a Category 2 hurricane while located east @-@ northeast of <unk> , <unk> Roo , Mexico ( actual use of the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale , which was developed in 1971 , was not in effect ) . Shortly thereafter , Carla crossed the Yucatán Channel and entered the Gulf of Mexico . A strong high pressure area forced Carla to resume its original northwesterly course . Early on September 8 , the storm strengthened into a Category 3 hurricane while located just north of the Yucatán Peninsula . Thus , Carla was the third major hurricane of the season . Carla was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane early on September 10 , while approaching the Gulf Coast of the United States . At 0000 UTC on September 11 , Carla strengthened into a Category 5 while located in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico . Six hours later , the storm reached its maximum sustained wind speed of 175 mph ( 280 km / h ) . 
 Although it weakened back to a Category 4 hurricane late on September 11 , Carla reached its minimum barometric pressure of <unk> mbar ( 27 @.@ 5 inHg ) . Later that day , the storm struck Matagorda Island , Texas ( seven miles south of Port O 'Connor ) with winds of 145 mph ( 230 km / h ) . Carla rapidly weakened inland , and degenerated to a Category 2 hurricane on September 12 , while passing just east of Port <unk> . Six hours later , the storm was downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane near <unk> , shortly before being downgraded to a tropical storm between Taylor and <unk> . Beginning late on September 12 , the storm curved just east of due north . After reaching Oklahoma early on September 13 , Carla transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while located over rural Johnston County . The extratropical remnants of Carla moved rapidly northeastward and brought heavy rainfall to some areas of the Great Plains and Midwestern United States . By September 14 , it entered Canada near <unk> <unk> . Marie , Ontario . Continuing swiftly northeastward across Ontario , Quebec , and <unk> , before the remnants dissipated over the <unk> Sea on September 17 . 
 <unk> a year after Hurricane <unk> , officials in the Florida Keys took precautions to <unk> for potential impact from the storm . The United States Navy flew their planes out of Key West , while Coast Guardsmen evacuated <unk> Reef Light , American <unk> Light , and <unk> Key Light . Ships docked at Key West sailed out to sea to ride out the squalls . On the morning of September 7 , a hurricane watch was issued from the entire coast of Louisiana eastward to <unk> , Florida . On September 8 , a hurricane watch was issued along the southwest coast of the state from <unk> Bay westward . It was later extended westward to include the entire coast of Texas , and eastward to <unk> , Florida . A portion of the hurricane watch from Aransas Pass , Texas to Grand Isle , Louisiana was upgraded to a hurricane warning at 1600 UTC on September 9 . An estimated 500 @,@ 000 people fled the coasts of Texas and Louisiana , making it the largest evacuation in the history of the United States , at the time . Further , at least half of those people were from Texas . In small towns along the coast of Texas , 90 – 100 % of their populations evacuated , while 20 % of people left the larger cities . Many in Galveston stayed due to protection from the Galveston <unk> . 
 Carla spawned the largest hurricane @-@ related tornado outbreak on record at the time , when 26 tornadoes touched down within its circulation . However , it was overwhelmingly surpassed by Hurricane <unk> in 1967 , which spawned at least 115 tornadoes . Throughout its path , 43 fatalities and about $ 325 @.@ 74 million in damage were attributed to Carla . Most of the impact occurred in Texas , where the storm made landfall as a large and strong Category 4 hurricane . 
 The most significant damage to property occurred between Port Arthur and Corpus Christi . Port O 'Connor , lying nearest to the location of Carla 's landfall , was virtually destroyed . In Victoria , the highest sustained wind speed was 110 mph ( 180 km / h ) , while gusts reached 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) . About 4 @,@ 260 homes were damaged , with around 500 severely damaged or destroyed . 43 businesses and 26 public buildings were also significantly impacted . Damage in the city of Victoria reached $ 10 million . Of the 26 tornadoes spawned by Carla , eight of them in Texas caused significant impact . A tornado near Bay City destroyed two radio towers and damaged several buildings . Near Jacksonville , a tornado injured three people , caused the destruction of one house and impacted 3 others , resulting in $ 25 @,@ 000 in damage . Twenty @-@ two people were injured , 18 homes and 6 commercial buildings were destroyed , and 40 additional homes were damaged in a tornado in <unk> , located near Houston ; losses reached $ 200 @,@ 000 . In the early morning hours of September 13 , an <unk> tornado moved across Galveston Island along a 15 @-@ mile ( 24 @-@ kilometer ) long , 230 @-@ yard @-@ wide path ( it crossed into Galveston Bay as well ) , severely damaging 200 buildings , of which at least 60 were destroyed , and causing eight deaths and 55 injuries . A few hours later , another <unk> in the area resulted in the destruction of six houses and extensive lesser damage . In <unk> , a tornado damaged six homes . Several structures sustained impact during a tornado in <unk> . The final <unk> occurred during the late afternoon hours in Latex . It caused two injuries , and resulted in $ 5 @,@ 000 in losses , after damaging two houses and three <unk> . 
 Then little @-@ known <unk> Dan Rather reported live from the Galveston <unk> during the storm , an act that would be imitated by later reporters . This marked the first live television broadcast of a hurricane . Rather also alerted the public of the size of Carla in a way that " literally changed the way the world sees hurricanes " , according to a fellow reporter . Broadcasting live at the Weather Bureau Office in Galveston , Rather asked a meteorologist to draw an outline of the Gulf of Mexico on a transparent sheet of plastic . He then held the map over the black and white radar screen , which put the size of Carla into perspective . CBS was so impressed with Rather 's work that he was offered the position of correspondent . Throughout Texas , Carla destroyed 1 @,@ <unk> homes , 568 farm buildings , and 415 other buildings . Additionally , 50 @,@ <unk> homes , 5 @,@ 620 farm buildings , and 10 @,@ <unk> other buildings suffered damage . There were 460 injuries according to the American Red Cross , though the Monthly Weather Review listed a slightly higher number , <unk> . The storm caused 34 fatalities in Texas . Causes of death include 20 people drowning , eight from tornadoes , four <unk> , and one heart attack . Overall , damage in the state was " <unk> " estimated at $ 300 million . A breakdown of damage indicates $ 200 million incurred to property and $ 100 million to crops , mostly from <unk> rice and lesser impact to cotton and citrus . 
 In southeastern Louisiana , abnormally high tides <unk> the coast , though no beach erosion was reported . Rainfall was heavy , peaking at 13 @.@ 9 inches ( 350 mm ) in Many . Other observed precipitation totals include 5 @.@ 6 inches ( 140 mm ) in <unk> Rouge , 5 @.@ 57 inches ( 141 mm ) in Morgan City , 4 @.@ 25 inches ( 108 mm ) in Shreveport , 3 @.@ 16 inches ( 80 mm ) in New Orleans , 2 @.@ 25 inches ( 57 mm ) in Lafayette , 2 @.@ 19 inches ( 56 mm ) in Alexandria , 2 @.@ 1 inches ( 53 mm ) in <unk> and West Monroe , and 1 @.@ 37 inches ( 35 mm ) in Lake Charles . In the western portions of Louisiana , sustained winds peaked at 44 mph ( 71 km / h ) and gusts reached 55 mph ( 89 km / h ) . Only minor damage occurred , limited to roofs , glass , and downed tree limbs . Winds caused a local river to reach 1 foot ( 0 @.@ 30 m ) above flood stage . The 11 tornadoes spawned by Carla in Louisiana destroyed 140 homes and 11 farm and other buildings , while causing major damage to 231 additional homes and 11 farm and other buildings . Additionally , <unk> homes and 75 farm and other buildings suffered minor to moderate damage . Six fatalities and 199 injuries occurred , mostly related to the tornadoes . Damage in Louisiana totaled to about $ 25 million . A breakdown of losses include $ 6 million to agriculture , $ 5 million to buildings , $ 4 million to boats and beach property , $ 3 million to roads and bridges , $ 5 million to oil platforms just offshore , and $ 2 million in <unk> damage . 
 Carla and its remnants brought heavy rainfall and strong winds to portions of Oklahoma . About 2 – 8 inches ( 51 – 203 mm ) of rain fell in Grant , <unk> , <unk> Counties . <unk> amounts of at least 5 inches ( 130 mm ) fell in <unk> and <unk> County . Precipitation in the state peaked at 7 @.@ 68 inches ( 195 mm ) in <unk> . More than 140 city blocks were flooded with up to 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) in residential areas of <unk> and up to 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) in business areas . 225 homes and buildings in the city suffered water damaged . Throughout the state , damage in other areas included 90 homes and buildings in <unk> , 50 homes each in El <unk> and Oklahoma City , and 10 homes in Pawnee . Additionally , water inundation washed out several bridges and highways in northeastern parts of the state , leaving roads impassable . Sustained winds between 30 and 55 mph ( 48 and 89 km / h ) and gusts up to 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) were recorded in Oklahoma . Winds injured two people due to airborne debris . Winds and rain combined severely disrupted electrical and telephone services and caused $ <unk> @,@ 000 in damage , with $ 600 @,@ 000 to property and $ 70 @,@ 000 to crops . 
 The storm dropped precipitation amounts of 7 inches ( 180 mm ) throughout northwestern Illinois , with a peak of 8 @.@ 18 inches ( 208 mm ) in Mount Carroll . Thus , Carla is the second wettest tropical cyclone in Illinois , behind only Hurricane <unk> in 1957 . Additionally , up to 6 @.@ 29 inches ( 160 mm ) fell in 24 hours . Severe local flooding occurred , especially in the northern portions of the state . Heavy property and agricultural damage occurred . Streets and <unk> were reported to have flooded , while bridge approaches and a few small bridges were washed out . Precipitation of 2 @.@ 5 – 3 @.@ 5 inches ( 64 – 89 mm ) in Chicago flooded about 60 <unk> and 1 @,@ 000 <unk> . After the Chicago River rose 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) , the lock gate to Lake Michigan was opened to release excess water . However , the abrupt <unk> of water resulted in about $ 75 @,@ 000 in damage to boats at <unk> Harbor . 
 Winds in Key West reached 30 mph ( 48 km / h ) , while much of Florida reported rainfall from the outer bands of Carla . In Kansas , 4 to 7 inches ( 100 to 180 mm ) of rain in only 6 hours caused flash flooding . With a peak amount of 8 @.@ 52 inches ( 216 mm ) in Haddam , Carla was the <unk> tropical cyclone in Kansas , until being surpassed by Hurricane <unk> in 1986 and Tropical Storm Frances in 1998 . Severe crop damage occurred , especially in areas of <unk> and <unk> Counties and to the south of the Kansas River . Many highways were left impassable due to water inundation . A family of 4 drowned after their car was swept off a road near Waverly . A fifth fatality occurred after a car with one <unk> was swept into a tributary of the <unk> River near Fort Scott . The storm persistently produced winds of 35 to 50 mph ( 56 to 80 km / h ) , causing further agricultural damage . 
 In Cuba , broadcasts reported severe flooding near <unk> del <unk> , and in Los <unk> and Punta de <unk> . Offshore Honduras on Swan Island , a rainfall amount of 3 @.@ 89 inches ( 99 mm ) was reported along with wind gusts up to 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) . The remnants of Carla brought tropical storm force winds to some areas of Canada . In Ontario , gusty winds caused power outages in the Clarkson – Port Credit area . Electrical services were are disrupted in New Brunswick , due to winds up to 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) in Saint John . Winds of 57 mph ( 92 km / h ) <unk> Halifax in Nova Scotia , thus the Halifax Public Gardens closed for threat of falling trees and branches . 
 Shortly after the storm , Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson , a lifelong resident of Texas , toured the devastation in the state and met with officials from 18 different counties , remarking that " as always , <unk> are arising to a challenge ... We have suffered hurricane , tornado , and floods , but we in Texas are a bold and brave people . " After his report to President John F. Kennedy and Congress , $ 55 million was approved in aid for Texas , though Kennedy later requested an additional $ 65 million . President Kennedy issued a disaster declaration for Texas , allowing all jurisdictions in the state to apply for public assistance . The president also declared 6 parishes in Louisiana a disaster area . <unk> deployed 88 United States Marines to Galveston to patrol devastated areas . A United States Navy task force composed of medical and construction work teams was also sent to the area . Members of the United States National Guard assisted refugees in returning to their homes and worked to prevent looting . Owing the hurricane 's intensity and destruction , the name Carla was retired and will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane . It was replaced by Carol in the 1965 season . 
 <unk> Mohammed al @-@ <unk> ( Arabic : <unk> <unk> , <unk> ash @-@ <unk> ; also <unk> as <unk> ) ( July 31 , 1973 – September 11 , 2001 ) was one of five <unk> of American Airlines Flight 11 , which was <unk> and flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center as part of the September 11 attacks . 
 <unk> was an elementary school teacher from <unk> <unk> in the <unk> region of Saudi Arabia . In early 2000 he traveled to <unk> to seek treatment for mental problems . He and his younger brother <unk> traveled to Afghanistan in March 2000 and joined an Al @-@ <unk> training camp . The brothers were chosen , along with others from the same region of Saudi Arabia , to participate in the September 11 attacks . Once selected , <unk> returned to Saudi Arabia in October 2000 to obtain a clean passport , then returned to Afghanistan . In March 2001 , he recorded his last will and testament on video . 
 <unk> arrived in the United States in early June 2001 , staying in budget <unk> in the <unk> Beach area of south Florida . On September 5 , 2001 , <unk> traveled to Boston and checked into a <unk> with his brother . Six days later , <unk> arrived early in the morning at Boston 's Logan International Airport and boarded American Airlines Flight 11 . Fifteen minutes after take off , the flight was <unk> and deliberately crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center at 8 : 46 a.m. 
 In the aftermath of the attacks , some news reports mistakenly reported <unk> as a trained pilot and son of a Saudi diplomat , who was still alive and well . The <unk> family in <unk> <unk> spoke to the media , denying those early reports , saying that the <unk> brothers had disappeared and have not been heard from since . 
 On June 5 , 2001 , <unk> obtained an International Driving <unk> , which was issued in <unk> in the United Arab Emirates . <unk> al @-@ <unk> arrived together with fellow al @-@ <unk> member Ahmed al @-@ <unk> at Miami International Airport , via London , from Dubai on June 8 . Both were admitted as tourists for six months . <unk> opened a bank account at <unk> Bank in Florida on June 18 , with a deposit of $ 8 @,@ 000 that came from American Express traveler 's <unk> purchased on June 7 in the United Arab Emirates . 
 On August 28 , 2001 , <unk> and <unk> al @-@ <unk> made reservations on American Airlines Flight 11 , using the Mail <unk> <unk> in Hollywood , Florida as their address . The <unk> brothers contacted American Airlines on September 3 by telephone to change their first @-@ class seat assignments for American Airlines Flight 11 , selecting seats on the side of the aircraft that offered a direct view of the cockpit . <unk> and <unk> al @-@ <unk> left Florida for Boston on September 5 , traveling together on Delta Air Lines Flight <unk> . 
 By 07 : 40 , all five <unk> were aboard the flight , which was scheduled to depart at 07 : 45 . <unk> and <unk> al @-@ <unk> sat together in first class in seats <unk> and <unk> respectively . The aircraft <unk> away from Gate 26 , and departed Logan International Airport at 07 : 59 , following a 14 @-@ minute delay . Flight 11 was <unk> at approximately 08 : 14 , which is when the pilot stopped responding to air traffic control . Once the <unk> began , the brothers are suspected of having stabbed two flight attendants . At 08 : 46 : 40 , Mohamed <unk> deliberately crashed Flight 11 into the northern facade of the North Tower ( Tower 1 ) of the World Trade Center . The immediate damage destroyed any means of escape from above the impact zone , trapping 1 @,@ 344 people . The North Tower collapsed at 10 : 28 , after burning for 102 minutes . 
 Saudi officials later stated that the names of the <unk> were in fact correct , and that 15 of the 19 <unk> were Saudi . In response to 9 / 11 conspiracy theories surrounding its original news story suggesting <unk> were still alive , the BBC issued a response in 2006 , saying that later reports on the <unk> superseded the original story . The BBC also explained that confusion arose with the Arabic names that were common . 
 Red <unk> Stranger is a 1975 album by American outlaw country singer Willie Nelson . After the wide success of his recordings with Atlantic Records , coupled with the negotiating skills of his manager , Neil <unk> , Nelson signed a contract with Columbia Records , a label that gave him total creative control over his works . The concept for the album was inspired by the " Tale of the Red <unk> Stranger " , a song that Nelson used to play as a disk jockey on his program in Fort Worth , Texas . After signing with Columbia he decided to record the song , and arranged the details during his return to Austin , Texas , from a trip to Colorado . It was recorded at low cost at Autumn Sound Studios in Garland , Texas . The songs featured sparse arrangements , largely limited to Nelson 's guitar , piano and drums . Nelson presented the finished material to Columbia executives , who were dubious about releasing an album that they at first thought was a demo . However , Nelson had creative control , so no further production was added . 
 A concept album , Red <unk> Stranger is about a fugitive on the run from the law after killing his wife and her lover . The content consists of songs with brief poetic lyrics and arrangements of older material such as Fred Rose 's " Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain " , Wolfe Gilbert 's " Down <unk> " and <unk> <unk> ' " O <unk> the Waves " . Despite Columbia 's doubts and the limited instrumentation , Red <unk> Stranger was a blockbuster among country music and mainstream audiences . It was certified multi @-@ platinum , and made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music . The cover of " Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain " , released as a single previous to the album full release became Nelson 's first number one hit . The title of the album would become a lasting nickname for Nelson . It was ranked # 183 on Rolling Stone 's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time , and number one on <unk> 's 40 Greatest Albums in Country Music . In 2010 it was inducted to the National Recording <unk> . 
 In 1986 Nelson starred as the Red <unk> Stranger in a movie of the same name , based on the story of the album . The album has had a strong cultural impact ; the song " Time of the Preacher " has been used often in the series Edge of Darkness , and its lyrics were used as well in the first issue of the comic Preacher . 
 In 1973 Nelson signed a contract for US $ 25 @,@ 000 per year with Atlantic Records , the first country artist signed by the label . His first album with Atlantic was the critically acclaimed <unk> Willie , which was followed by one of the first concept albums in country music , <unk> and <unk> . Due to the success of these recordings , Nelson signed with Columbia Records , and was given complete creative control . 
 Nelson started to look for a studio in Texas to record his new material , to avoid the modifications that they did to his recordings in his previous sessions . Engineer Phil York , who was hired free @-@ lance by the recently opened Autumn Sound Studios in Garland , Texas , heard about his need . York , an acquaintance of Nelson 's <unk> Mickey Raphael , offered Nelson a day of free recording to boost the popularity of the studio . Nelson and his band went to the trial session during January , and recorded five songs . Later , <unk> called back York , announcing that Nelson would record the entire album there . After hearing the tapes by Nelson , the band started to improvise to the song " Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain " . <unk> the result , Nelson decided to strip down the instrumentation . Nelson also instructed York to <unk> the <unk> he performed on the tracks , remarking that it was the method his producers used in Nashville . The recording took five days , with an additional day for the mixing , that summed up to US $ 4 @,@ 000 in studio <unk> <unk> costs took the total to US $ 20 @,@ 000 . 
 Nelson featured arrangements of acoustic guitar , accompanied by piano , played by his sister , <unk> , as well complementary arrangements of drums , harmonica and mandolin . The sparsely <unk> acoustic arrangements caused Columbia directors to doubt the wisdom of releasing the album as presented , feeling it was under @-@ produced and no more than a demo . However , Nelson had complete creative control , and it was released without any further modifications . 
 The story begins with " Time of the Preacher " , where the character evokes his love for his wife , whom he suspects is <unk> . In the following song , " I Couldn 't Believe It Was True " , the <unk> is revealed . This leads to a short version of " Time of the Preacher , " wherein the singer ends with the line " Now the lesson is over , and the killing 's begun " . The reaction of the husband is depicted by Nelson in a medley of " Blue Rock , Montana " and " Red <unk> Stranger " . The first song describes the double murder of the <unk> woman and her lover by the Stranger , who states " And they died with a smile on their faces . " This leads to the second song of the medley , which describes the grief of the Stranger . This section is followed by Nelson 's cover of the 1947 Fred Rose , song " Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain " , where the fugitive laments the loss of his wife . In " Red <unk> Stranger , " the protagonist commits a subsequent murder — he kills a woman he believes is stealing his horse . The horse , to which he undoubtedly holds a sentimental attachment , had belonged to the Stranger 's wife . 
 The story continues with the Stranger traveling south . In the song " Denver , " the character falls in love with a woman he meets in a bar in town . One of the lines from " Blue Rock Montana " is repeated , with a variation : " And they danced with a smile on their faces " . The following song , " Can I Sleep in Your Arms ? " , shows the desire of the Stranger for redemption and love . Next is " Remember Me " , where he announces that his vows to his deceased wife are broken and he is free to love . The story ends with " Hands on the Wheel " , which depicts the Stranger as an old man who is accompanied by a child , presumably his grandson , and his new love . The song marks the end of the <unk> of the Stranger , and his redemption years later . The album ends with the instrumental song " <unk> " . 
 Red <unk> Stranger reached number one on the Billboard chart for Top Country Albums , and number 28 during a 43 @-@ week stay in the Top <unk> & Tapes chart . On March 11 , 1976 , it was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America , and on November 21 , 1986 , it was certified double @-@ platinum . 
 Rolling Stone writer Paul Nelson wrote : " Red <unk> Stranger is extraordinarily ambitious , cool , tightly controlled .... <unk> , who <unk> an art of sharp outlines and <unk> phrases , used to say that the full power of his composition was accessible only between the lines ; and Nelson , on this LP , ties precise , evocative lyrics to not quite remembered , never really forgotten folk melodies to create a similar effect , haunting yet utterly <unk> . That he did not write much of the material makes his accomplishment no less singular . " Meanwhile , critic Robert Christgau wrote , " Some of the individual pieces are quite nice , but the <unk> is the concept album at its most counterproductive — the lyrics render the nostalgic instrumental parts <unk> ironic and lose additional charm in narrative context . " 
 Music critic <unk> <unk> wrote in a Texas Monthly article entitled " <unk> , Mark , Luke and Willie : Willie Nelson 's latest album is more than a good country music ; it 's almost Gospel " : " The difference between Nelson 's Red <unk> Stranger and any current C & W album , and especially what passes for a soundtrack for Nashville , is <unk> . What Nelson has done is simply <unk> ; it is the only record I have heard that strikes me as <unk> . Red <unk> Stranger <unk> up such strange emotions and works on so many levels that listening to it becomes totally <unk> " . 
 Billboard described the album as " lots of instrumental work , with particularly fine piano by <unk> Nelson , and the usual highly stylized Willie Nelson vocals " . Mother Jones wrote : " <unk> have known for 15 years what Red <unk> Stranger finally revealed to the world – that Nelson is simply too brilliant a songwriter , interpreter , and singer – just too damn universal – to be defined as merely a country artist " . 
 In 1996 <unk> New Music Monthly wrote : " His Red <unk> Stranger was the Sgt. <unk> 's of country music , the first record to follow a coherent theme instead of merely compiling radio singles " . AllMusic described Red <unk> Stranger as " really elusive , as the themes get a little <unk> and the tunes themselves are a bit bare . It 's undoubtedly distinctive – and it sounds more distinctive with each passing year – but it 's strictly an intellectual triumph and , after a pair of albums that were musically and <unk> sound , it 's a bit of a <unk> , no matter how successful it was " . In 2003 it was included among the top 1 @,@ 000 albums of <unk> Survey magazine , and was rated five stars out of five . The magazine wrote , " Supporters ( of the album ) spread the gospel that it 's just a quintessential outlaw recording , but perhaps the greatest country album ever with a spare style that changed the way C & W was played " . 
 Red <unk> Stranger 's critical success cemented Nelson 's outlaw image , and made him one of the most recognized artists in country music . The title of the album became a long lasting nickname for him . The cover of Fred Rose 's 1945 song " Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain " , that had been released as a single previous to the album , became his first number one hit as a singer . In 2004 the album was ranked at number 184 on Rolling Stone 's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time , and number one in <unk> 's 40 Greatest Albums in Country Music in 2006 . In 2009 it was adopted into the National Recording <unk> because Red <unk> Stranger is " culturally , historically , or <unk> important , and / or informs or reflects life in the United States . " 
 At an appearance at the <unk> World Headquarters , a music venue in Austin , Texas , Nelson met publisher and screenwriter William D. <unk> . Because of the success of the album , <unk> decided to write a script for Nelson based on the story of the Red <unk> Stranger . In 1979 <unk> finished a draft of the project , which was turned over to Universal Studios . The studio budgeted the film at $ 14 million and sent the script to Robert <unk> , who turned it down . The movie project was <unk> , and <unk> and Nelson had to buy the script back from Universal . The script then went to HBO , who assigned the project a budget of $ 5 million , but this project was not completed either . Finally , Nelson and <unk> decided to finance the film themselves . Nelson portrayed the role of the stranger , and the movie was released in 1986 . 
 The first track , " Time of the Preacher " , was used in Bob Dylan 's 1978 film <unk> and <unk> and episodes of the 1985 television drama Edge of Darkness . The lyrics to " Time of the Preacher " were used in the opening pages of the first issue of the Vertigo comic book Preacher , with the song being used in the opening of the premiere of the TV series based on the comic . 
 The complete album was performed and recorded by Carla <unk> in 2003 . The Red <unk> Stranger included a guest appearance by Nelson . A first season episode of the <unk> series <unk> is entitled " Mr. <unk> and the Red @-@ <unk> Stranger , " and guest @-@ stars Willie Nelson . 
 The album was reissued by Columbia / Legacy in 2000 . The new issue features remastered sound , as well as the inclusion of previously unreleased songs . 
 The flag of West Virginia is the official flag of the U.S. state of West Virginia and was officially adopted by the West Virginia Legislature on March 7 , 1863 . The present flag consists of a pure white field bordered by a blue stripe with the coat of arms of West Virginia in the center , <unk> by <unk> maximum and topped by an <unk> red ribbon reading " State of West Virginia . " 
 The first flags to represent West Virginia following statehood were battle flags utilized by West Virginia regiments during the American Civil War . West Virginia 's first official state flag was adopted in 1905 , based upon the flag designed and used by the West Virginia State Commission at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in 1904 . This flag was altered in 1907 for the Jamestown Exposition and featured the coat of arms on the <unk> and a <unk> of <unk> maximum on the reverse . In order to reproduce the flag more <unk> , the West Virginia Legislature ratified the current flag with the state 's coat of arms integrated with the <unk> , which appears on both the <unk> and the reverse . The " <unk> of <unk> to the West Virginia State Flag " was unanimously adopted by the office of the Secretary of State of West Virginia in 1977 . 
 The state flag 's proportions are identical to those of the flag of the United States . When utilized for parade purposes , all but the staff side of the state flag are to be trimmed with gold fringe . When used concurrently with the flag of the United States during ceremonial occasions , the state flag is trimmed and mounted like the United States flag with regard to fringe , <unk> , <unk> , and mounting . 
 Prior to the adoption of the current state flag of West Virginia , the state had been represented by a number of flags since attaining statehood in 1863 , all of which proved impractical . The first West Virginia Legislature commissioned Joseph H. <unk> <unk> of <unk> County to design the Great Seal of West Virginia in 1863 . On September 26 , 1863 , the West Virginia Legislature officially adopted the seal designed by <unk> <unk> , a stylized version of which was also designated the state 's coat of arms . Despite the adoption of an official seal , the state did not decide upon an official state flag until 1905 . 
 Prior to West Virginia 's separation from Virginia on June 20 , 1863 , pro @-@ Union supporters in western Virginia created unique flags to show their support for the Union cause . In January 1861 , the residents of <unk> erected a flagpole measuring about 105 feet ( 32 m ) in height , and on it they <unk> a <unk> <unk> with the word " <unk> " prior to Virginia 's <unk> . During the war , western Virginia regiments in the Union Army carried flags <unk> by supportive women , as was the case with the Fifth Regiment Virginia Volunteer Infantry who carried a flag bearing the legend " 5th <unk> . Regiment " in 1861 . 
 In January 1864 , the West Virginia Legislature approved a flag for the Fourth Regiment West Virginia Volunteer Infantry to acknowledge the regiment 's battles at Charleston , <unk> , Jackson , and <unk> Ridge , all four of which were listed on the flag . This was the first among many battle flags to represent West Virginia after statehood which were utilized by soldiers of West Virginia regiments throughout the war . State battle flags were presented to each of West Virginia 's Union regiments during the course of the war . These early state flags were squares of silk cloth measuring 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) , and were dark blue and trimmed with golden fringe . The <unk> side of these flags were painted with the state 's newly minted seal within an oval , along with the name of the respective West Virginia regiment and the names and dates of the battles in which they had participated . On the reverse side , the United States national emblem was painted and consisted of a bald eagle with its wings <unk> , clutching a bundle of 13 arrows in its right <unk> and an olive branch in its left , and a <unk> shield placed across its breast . In its beak , the eagle <unk> a scroll with the national Latin motto E <unk> <unk> ( English : " Out of Many , One " ) . Following the conclusion of the American Civil War , the state of West Virginia had no official flag , and the matter was not taken up until the early 20th century . 
 The need for an official state flag arose in 1904 when the West Virginia State Commission to the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis reported that the state required a flag or <unk> to represent and distinguish itself among the other U.S. states at the <unk> . In lieu of an official state flag , the commission adopted and used a state flag of its own design at the West Virginia building at the <unk> , which was a " <unk> of mountain <unk> upon an <unk> white field with a pale blue border " . 
 In its report to the West Virginia Legislature , the West Virginia State Commission recommended the adoption of their flag design as the official state flag . On February 24 , 1905 , the West Virginia Legislature ratified the commission 's flag design following its passage of Joint Resolution Number 16 during the gubernatorial administration of Albert B. White . The legislature adopted the commission 's flag design , with the addition of a fringe or border of <unk> red . The state flag was approved by the legislature to be employed on occasions where a special display of the state 's individuality was necessary or regarded as appropriate . According to the 1905 joint resolution : 
 Said state flag shall be in length and breadth in the proportion of nine to thirteen , this being the same as the flag of the great American Republic of which West Virginia forms a part ; the field <unk> shall be pure white , upon the center of which shall be a <unk> of the <unk> maximum or " big <unk> , " having flowers and leaves ; and on the reverse side shall be the state coat @-@ of @-@ arms and the motto ; the field of pure white shall be bordered by a band or strip of blue , and this in turn shall be bordered by a strip of fringe of <unk> red ; and said flag shall be regarded and used as the West Virginia state flag on all occasions where a special display of the state 's individuality shall become necessary , or be regarded as appropriate . 
 Following its formal adoption by the legislature , schools and other institutions throughout West Virginia began flying the new state flag . The teachers and students at the schools in <unk> purchased the new state flag in June 1906 , which measured 5 @.@ 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 7 m ) in length , and used it along with the United States flag for <unk> and patriotic exercises . 
 By 1907 , the West Virginia Legislature found the 1905 state flag design to be completely <unk> due to the <unk> on one side reading toward the staff , and the differing colors on each respective side showing through the opposite side of the flag 's white field of cloth . The state legislature found that this destroyed " the distinctive features of the banner and leaving the state without a prescribed official flag " . The West Virginia Legislature sought to remedy the state flag 's design flaws in 1907 so that the state could be properly represented at the Jamestown Exposition in Norfolk . On February 25 , 1907 , during the administration of Governor William M. O. Dawson , the West Virginia Legislature passed Joint Resolution 2 , which amended the flag by removing the seal and motto from the reverse side and changing the color of the bordering fringe from <unk> red to old gold . Instead of the seal and motto , the reverse of the flag was changed to consist of " a spring or <unk> of the <unk> maximum " . According to the 1907 joint resolution : 
 Said state flag shall be in length and breadth in proportion the same as the flag of the great American Republic of which West Virginia forms a part ; the field <unk> shall be pure white , upon the center of which on the observe side shall be the great seal or coat of arms of the state , beneath which shall appear the legend " State of West Virginia , " in a scroll ; on the reverse side shall appear a <unk> or <unk> of the <unk> maximum , or big <unk> , our state flower , having <unk> and leaves ; the field of pure white shall be bordered by a band or strip of blue , and this in turn shall be bordered by a strip or fringe of old gold ; and said flag shall be regarded and used as the West Virginia state flag on all occasions where a special display of the state 's individuality shall become necessary , or be regarded as appropriate . 
 The flag design ratified in 1907 remained the state 's official flag until 1929 . The state of West Virginia sought a flag design that could be produced <unk> so that the state flag could be mass @-@ produced for the state 's public schools . The 1907 flag proved to be more costly to reproduce due to the two different symbols on each side of the banner , the state 's coat of arms on the <unk> and the state 's flower on the reverse . The West Virginia Legislature decided the state flag should be stamped with a design that would integrate both the coat of arms and the state flower on both sides . The design of the present state flag was officially adopted by the West Virginia Legislature on March 7 , 1929 , by West Virginia Senate Joint Resolution Number 18 . According to the joint resolution : 
 In 2001 , the North American <unk> Association surveyed its members and other flag enthusiasts on the designs of the 72 U.S. state , U.S. territorial , and Canadian provincial flags . Members ranked the West Virginia state flag at 51 out of the 72 flags surveyed . U.S. state flags with state seals on solid @-@ color fields , like the West Virginia state flag , proved unpopular in the survey . 
 The West Virginia Legislature has passed a series of laws in the West Virginia Code governing the usage of the West Virginia state flag . The state flag is not permitted to be placed above , or if on the same level , to the right of the United States flag . Both the United States and West Virginia state flags are to be flown over the West Virginia State Capitol building year @-@ round . Any United States or West Virginia state flag purchased with state funds must be manufactured in the United States ; and West Virginia county boards of education must only purchase state flags manufactured in the United States if board building funds are used . To honor the death of law @-@ enforcement officers within the state , the West Virginia Code permits the <unk> of the state flag over the coffin at no cost , upon the request of the next @-@ of @-@ <unk> . 
 <unk> July 18 , 2013 , the office of West Virginia Governor Earl Ray <unk> established guidelines in accordance with the United States Code and West Virginia precedent and customs regarding the half @-@ mast display of United States and West Virginia state flags on West Virginia state properties . Both the United States and West Virginia state flags are to be <unk> to full @-@ mast , before being lowered to the half @-@ mast position ; likewise both flags are to be <unk> full @-@ mast prior to being lowered for the day . Both flags are only to be displayed in the half @-@ mast position in accordance with Federal law on the following occasions : 
 Memorial Day ( the last Monday in May ) : flags are displayed at half @-@ mast from <unk> until noon , then raised to full @-@ mast . 
 Peace Officers Memorial Day ( May 15 ) : flags are displayed at half @-@ mast for the entire day , unless that day is also Armed Forces Day ( the third Saturday in May ) . 
 National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day ( December 7 ) : flags are displayed at half @-@ mast for the entire day . 
 Flags are displayed at half @-@ mast for 30 days following the day of death of either a current or former President of the United States . 
 Flags are displayed at half @-@ mast for ten days following the day of death of the Vice President of the United States , the Chief Justice or retired Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States , or the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives . 
 Flags are displayed at half @-@ mast from the day of death until the day of interment of a former Vice President , an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court , a Secretary of an executive or military department of the United States , or a Governor of a U.S. state , territory , or possession . 
 Flags are displayed at half @-@ mast on the day of death and the following day for a member of the United States Congress . 
 Flags displayed at half @-@ mast on state properties following a proclamation by the Governor of West Virginia during other unique instances outlined in the 2013 guidelines . 
 According to West Virginia state law , the <unk> of either the flag of the United States or the West Virginia state flag is an offense punishable as a <unk> and upon conviction , a guilty verdict can result in a fine " not less than five nor more than one hundred dollars , " or confinement in jail " for a period not exceeding thirty days " at " the discretion of the court or justice trying the case . " 
 However , such laws are <unk> as the United States Supreme Court in Texas v. Johnson , 491 U.S. <unk> ( 1989 ) , and reaffirmed in U.S. v. <unk> , <unk> U.S. 310 ( 1990 ) , has ruled that due to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution , it is unconstitutional for a government ( whether federal , state , or municipality ) to prohibit the <unk> of a flag , due to its status as " symbolic speech . " 
 On February 8 , 1977 , the office of the Secretary of State of West Virginia unanimously adopted the " <unk> of <unk> to the West Virginia State Flag . " The motion to adopt the pledge was made by Charles S. Smith and seconded by Carol J. Calvert . The pledge reads as follows : 
 I pledge allegiance to the flag of West Virginia , which serves as a constant reminder that " <unk> Are Always Free , " which stands as a symbol of her <unk> mountains , fertile forests , rich veins of coal , and the pride of her people . 
 The Battle of <unk> was the second <unk> of the Texas Revolution . In the early @-@ morning hours of October 9 , 1835 , Texas settlers attacked the Mexican Army soldiers garrisoned at <unk> La Bahía , a fort near the Mexican Texas settlement of <unk> . La Bahía lay halfway between the only other large garrison of Mexican soldiers ( at <unk> San Antonio de <unk> ) and the then @-@ important Texas port of <unk> . 
 The garrison at La Bahía was <unk> and could not mount an effective defense of the fort 's perimeter . Using axes borrowed from <unk> , <unk> were able to chop through a door and enter the complex before the bulk of the soldiers were aware of their presence . After a 30 @-@ minute battle , the Mexican garrison , under Colonel Juan López <unk> , surrendered . One Mexican soldier had been killed and three others wounded , while only one <unk> had been injured . The majority of the Mexican soldiers were instructed to leave Texas , and the <unk> confiscated $ 10 @,@ 000 worth of provisions and several cannons , which they soon transported to the <unk> Army for use in the Siege of <unk> . The victory isolated <unk> 's men in <unk> from the coast , forcing them to rely on a long overland march to request or receive reinforcements or supplies . 
 In 1835 , Mexico operated two major garrisons within its Texas territory , the <unk> at San Antonio de <unk> and <unk> La Bahía near <unk> . <unk> was the political center of Texas , and <unk> laid halfway between it and the major Texas port of <unk> . Military and civilian supplies and military personnel were usually sent by sea from the Mexican interior to <unk> Bay and then could be transported overland to the Texas settlements . 
 On October 6 , members of the <unk> militia in Matagorda convened at the home of <unk> <unk> . As their first order of business they elected George <unk> as their captain ; Dr. William Carleton was then named first lieutenant and D.C. <unk> became the unit 's second lieutenant . After appointing their leaders , the men decided to march on La Bahía . They intended to kidnap <unk> and , if possible , steal the estimated $ 50 @,@ 000 that was <unk> to accompany him . The <unk> sent messengers to alert nearby settlements of their quest . By afternoon , 50 <unk> were ready to march from Matagorda . During the march , for unknown reasons the men fired Carleton and appointed James W. Moore as the new first lieutenant . 
 The following day the expedition stopped at Victoria , where they were soon joined by English @-@ speaking settlers from other settlements and 30 <unk> led by <unk> <unk> . Although no accurate muster rolls were kept , historian Stephen <unk> estimated that the <unk> ranks swelled to 125 men . Forty @-@ nine of them signed a " Compact of Volunteers under <unk> " on October 9 . These men pledged that they were loyal to the Mexican federal government and would harm no one who remained loyal to the <unk> cause . 
 The main body of <unk> soldiers , under <unk> , became <unk> in the dark and wandered from the road . They were soon tangled in a <unk> thicket . While working their way back towards the road , the <unk> met Ben <unk> , a Texas <unk> who had recently escaped from prison in <unk> . <unk> joined the militia as a private , and the group soon rejoined the vanguard . 
 The Mexican soldiers opened fire , hitting Samuel <unk> , a former slave whom George <unk> had freed , in the shoulder . <unk> returned fire for approximately 30 minutes . During a pause in the fighting , a <unk> spokesman <unk> out that they would " massacre everyone of you , unless you come out immediately and surrender " . The Mexican garrison immediately surrendered . 
 <unk> was the only <unk> soldier to be wounded , and he later claimed to be the " first whose blood was shed in the Texas War for Independence " . This distinction earned him a permanent home ; a later law prohibited any freed slave from residing in the Republic of Texas , but in 1840 the Texas legislature specifically excluded <unk> , his family , and his descendants from its enforcement . The exclusion was reward for <unk> 's service and his injury . 
 <unk> troops confiscated the provisions they found at the fort . Although they found 300 <unk> , most of them were broken and unable to be repaired . <unk> hired two <unk> who were able to bring the remaining weapons into service . The food , clothing , blankets , and other provisions were valued at US $ 10 @,@ 000 . The new <unk> at the fort , John J. <unk> , reported that 175 barrels of flour were confiscated , along with a large supply of sugar , coffee , whiskey , and <unk> . For the next three months , the provisions were <unk> out among companies in the <unk> Army . The <unk> also gained control of several cannons . 
 The loss of <unk> meant that <unk> lost his means of communicating with <unk> Bay , the closest port to <unk> . The Mexican troops garrisoned at <unk> would now need to get supplies and reinforcements overland . 
 In music , noise is variously described as <unk> , indeterminate , uncontrolled , loud , <unk> , or <unk> sound . <unk> is an important component of the sound of the human voice and all musical instruments , particularly in <unk> percussion instruments and electric guitars ( using distortion ) . Electronic instruments create various colours of noise . Traditional uses of noise are unrestricted , using all the frequencies associated with pitch and <unk> , such as the white noise component of a drum roll on a <unk> drum , or the <unk> present in the prefix of the sounds of some organ pipes . 
 The influence of <unk> in the early 20th century lead composers such as Edgar <unk> to explore the use of noise @-@ based <unk> in an orchestral setting . In the same period the Italian <unk> Luigi <unk> created a " noise orchestra " using instruments he called <unk> . Later in the 20th century the term noise music came to refer to works consisting primarily of noise @-@ based sound . 
 In more general usage , noise is any <unk> sound or signal . In this sense , even sounds that would be perceived as musically ordinary in another context become noise if they interfere with the reception of a message desired by the receiver . Prevention and reduction of <unk> sound , from tape hiss to <unk> bass drum <unk> , is important in many musical <unk> , but noise is also used creatively in many ways , and in some way in nearly all genres . 
 In regard to what is noise as opposed to music , Robert <unk> in The Origin of Music : A Theory of the Universal Development of Music claims that while cultural theories view the difference between noise and music as purely the result of social forces , habit , and custom , " everywhere in history we see man making some selections of some sounds as noise , certain other sounds as music , and in the overall development of all cultures , this distinction is made around the same sounds . " However , <unk> Jean @-@ Jacques <unk> considers the difference between noise and music nebulous , explaining that " The border between music and noise is always culturally defined — which implies that , even within a single society , this border does not always pass through the same place ; in short , there is rarely a consensus ... By all accounts there is no single and <unk> universal concept defining what music might be . " 
 Musical tones produced by the human voice and all <unk> musical instruments incorporate noises in varying degrees . Most consonants in human speech ( e.g. , the sounds of f , v , s , <unk> , both voiced and <unk> <unk> , Scottish and German <unk> ) are characterised by distinctive noises , and even vowels are not entirely noise free . Wind instruments include the <unk> or <unk> sounds of air breaking against the edges of the <unk> , while bowed instruments produce audible rubbing noises that contribute , when the instrument is poor or the player <unk> , to what is perceived as a poor tone . When they are not excessive , listeners " make themselves <unk> " to these noises by ignoring them . 
 Many <unk> percussion instruments , such as the <unk> drum or <unk> , make use of the presence of random sounds or noise to produce a sound without any perceived pitch . See <unk> . <unk> percussion is typically used to maintain a rhythm or to provide accents , and its sounds are unrelated to the melody and harmony of the music . Within the orchestra <unk> percussion is termed auxiliary percussion , and this <unk> of the percussion section includes all <unk> instruments of the orchestra no matter how they are played , for example the pea whistle and <unk> . 
 An altogether darker picture of the function of this noise music is painted by <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> – 10 , written in the late first century BC . He describes " a Greek of mean condition ... a low operator in sacrifices , and a <unk> ... a teacher of secret mysteries " who imported to <unk> and then to Rome a <unk> cult which attracted a large following . All manner of <unk> were practised by this cult , including rape and 
 secret murders ... [ where ] the bodies could not even be found for burial . Many of their <unk> <unk> were brought about by <unk> , but most of them by force , and this force was concealed by loud shouting , and the noise of drums and <unk> , so that none of the cries uttered by the persons suffering violation or murder could be heard abroad . 
 A Tahitian traditional dance genre dating back to before the first contact with European explorers is <unk> , danced by a group of men accompanied solely by a drum ensemble . The drums consist of a slit @-@ log drum called <unk> ‘ <unk> ( which provides the main rhythmic pattern ) , a single @-@ headed upright drum called <unk> ‘ <unk> , a single @-@ headed hand drum called <unk> <unk> ‘ i <unk> , and a double @-@ headed bass drum called <unk> . 
 An important aspect of all of these examples of noise in European keyboard and string music before the 19th century is that they are used as sound effects in programme music . Sounds that would likely cause offense in other musical contexts are made acceptable by their <unk> function . Over time , their evocative effect was weakened as at the same time they became incorporated more generally into abstract musical contexts . 
 <unk> continued to use noise in the form of a percussion section , which expanded though the 19th century : Berlioz was perhaps the first composer to thoroughly investigate the effects of different <unk> on the tone color of timpani . However , before the 20th century , percussion instruments played a very small role in orchestral music and mostly served for punctuation , to highlight passages , or for novelty . But by the 1940s , some composers were influenced by non @-@ Western music as well as jazz and popular music , and began incorporating <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , bells , <unk> , <unk> , and drums . 
 Use of noise was central to the development of experimental music and avant @-@ garde music in the mid 20th century . <unk> was used in important , new ways . 
 <unk> <unk> challenged traditional <unk> of musical and non @-@ musical sound and instead incorporated noise based <unk> into his <unk> work , what he referred to as " organised sound . " <unk> stated that " to stubbornly conditioned ears , anything new in music has always been called noise " , and he posed the question , " what is music but organized noises ? " . 
 In the years immediately following the First World War , Henry Cowell composed a number of piano pieces featuring tone clusters and direct manipulation of the piano 's strings . One of these , titled The <unk> ( 1925 ) , features <unk> and <unk> sounds suggesting the terrifying cry of the <unk> from Irish folklore . 
 In 1938 for a dance composition titled <unk> , John Cage invented the prepared piano , producing both transformed pitches and colorful <unk> sounds from the piano . Many variations , such as prepared guitar , have followed . In 1952 , Cage wrote 4 ′ 33 ″ , in which there is no deliberate sound at all , but only whatever background noise occurs during the performance . 
 <unk> <unk> employed noise in vocal compositions , such as <unk> ( 1962 – 64 / 69 ) , in which the four choirs <unk> their hands , talk , and <unk> their feet , in order to mediate between instrumental and vocal sounds as well as to incorporate sounds normally made by audiences into those produced by the performers . 
 Robert Ashley used audio feedback in his avant @-@ garde piece The <unk> ( 1964 ) by setting up a <unk> between the microphone and loudspeaker and then singing into the microphone in way that <unk> the feedback with his voice . 
 In the 1980s , electronic white noise machines became commercially available . These are used alone to provide a pleasant background noise and to mask unpleasant noise , a similar role to conventional background music . This usage can have health applications in the case of individuals struggling with over @-@ stimulation or sensory processing disorder . Also , white noise is sometimes used to mask sudden noise in facilities with research animals . 
 While the electric guitar was originally designed to be simply amplified in order to reproduce its sound at a higher volume , guitarists quickly discovered the creative possibilities of using the amplifier to modify the sound , particularly by extreme settings of tone and volume controls . 
 As well as distortion , rock musicians have used audio feedback , which is normally undesirable . The use of feedback was pioneered by musicians such as John Lennon of The Beatles , Jeff Beck of The <unk> , Pete <unk> of The Who , and Jimi Hendrix . Hendrix was able to control feedback and turn it into a musical quality , and his use of noise has been described as " sculpted - liquid and fire expertly shaped in mid @-@ air as if by a glass <unk> . " Other techniques used by Hendrix include distortion , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and loud volume . 
 The hip hop group Public Enemy in particular has been noted for its use of noise in its music . The group 's second album , It Takes a Nation of Millions to <unk> Us Back , was backed by the production team The <unk> Squad , who helped craft the album 's layered , anti @-@ harmonic , <unk> noise . Michael Eric <unk> describes the album as a " powerful mix of music , beats , screams , noise , and rhythms from the streets " , and considers it an example of the revival of black radical and nationalist thought . Public Enemy member Chuck D acknowledges that the group 's use of noise was an intentional attempt to blur the boundaries between popular music and the noise of everyday life , a decision which writer Jason W. <unk> says " ran directly counter to the values of mainstream music of the time . " He explains that " without a doubt " this intentional use of noise influenced not only the next decade of hip @-@ hop , but of rock as well . Furthermore , notes <unk> , the incorporation of noise served a political function , elevating the ordinary and thus suggesting that common , ordinary people should consider themselves on the same footing as their political and cultural leaders . 
 <unk> music ( also referred to simply as noise ) has been represented by many genres during the 20th century and subsequently . Some of its proponents reject the attempt to classify it as a single overall genre , preferring to call noise music a non @-@ genre , an aesthetic , or a collection of genres . Even among those who regard it as a genre , its scope is unclear . Some commentators use the phrase " noise music " ( or " noise " ) to refer specifically to Japanese noise music , while others instead use the term <unk> . 
 While noise music is often <unk> associated with extreme volume and distortion and produced by electronic <unk> , the tradition dates back at least to the <unk> Luigi <unk> , who rejected melody , constructed original instruments known as <unk> and assembled a " noise orchestra " in 1917 . It was not well received . In his 1913 manifesto The Art of <unk> he observes : 
 At first the art of music sought purity , <unk> and <unk> of sound . Then different sounds were amalgamated , care being taken , however , to <unk> the ear with gentle harmonies . Today music , as it becomes continually more complicated , <unk> to <unk> the most <unk> , strange and harsh sounds . In this way we come ever closer to noise @-@ sound . 
 Most often , musicians are concerned not to produce noise , but to minimise it . <unk> reduction is of particular concern in sound recording . This is accomplished by many techniques , including use of low noise components and proprietary noise reducing technologies such as <unk> . 
 <unk> created by mobile phones has become a particular concern in live performances , particularly those being recorded . In one notable incident , <unk> Alan Gilbert halted the New York Philharmonic in a performance of Gustav Mahler 's Symphony No. 9 until an audience member 's <unk> was <unk> . 
 Music played at excessive volumes is often considered a form of noise pollution . Governments such as that of the United Kingdom have local procedures for dealing with noise pollution , including loud music . 
 Music @-@ induced hearing loss is still a controversial topic for hearing researchers . While some studies have shown that the risk for hearing loss increases as music exposure increases , other studies found little to no correlation between the two .

The Wolverines appeared in the national championship game for the first time since 1989 – appearances in 1992 and 1993 were vacated due to a scandal . Following the season , at the 2013 NBA Draft , Burke and <unk> were selected ninth and twenty @-@ fourth , respectively , becoming the first pair of first @-@ round NBA draft choices from Michigan since the 1994 NBA Draft . 
 Glenn Robinson III , son of former first overall NBA draft pick Glenn Robinson , verbally committed on September 14 , 2010 as the first commitment in Michigan ’ s class of 2012 . On March 26 , 2011 , Michigan received its second verbal commitment of the class of 2012 from Canadian wing guard <unk> <unk> . On November 3 , Mitch <unk> , who was ranked as the number two prospect in the nation at the time , announced his verbal commitment to Michigan . Within hours of the commitment , ESPN announced that Michigan ranked as the fifth best class in the nation . Each of the three signed a National <unk> of Intent with the team on November 9 . After several other schools announced their commitments , the signing of <unk> moved Michigan from outside the top 25 at the end of October to the number 7 class in the nation by mid @-@ November , according to ESPN . That November , <unk> , Robinson and <unk> ranked 3 , 34 , and 79 , respectively , in the <unk> Class of 2012 Top 150 .

 Michigan enjoyed high expectations from the national media as well during the preseason . Sporting News named them to the number 5 position in its preseason poll , while conference <unk> Indiana and Ohio State were ranked number 1 and 3 , respectively . Michigan also earned the number 5 ranking in both the preseason Coaches ' Poll and preseason Associated Press poll , but behind Indiana ( # 1 ) and Ohio State ( # 4 ) in both . This was Michigan 's highest preseason ranking since the 1992 – 93 team . Sports Illustrated ranked Michigan number 9 in its October preseason power rankings , again behind Indiana ( # 1 ) and Ohio State ( # 6 ) , but when it printed its November preseason poll listed Michigan at number 6 ahead of Ohio State ( # 7 ) , but behind Indiana ( # 1 ) . Prior to the first exhibition game on November 1 , senior Josh <unk> was named team captain .

The shirts use the school colors with blue with <unk> <unk> . On February 12 , 2013 , when Michigan played the first of two regularly scheduled rivalry games against Michigan State , students in the <unk> at the <unk> Center wore T @-@ shirts with " <unk> <unk> " printed in <unk> colors ( green and white ) .

 " <unk> " – <unk> is also an acronym for " <unk> Excellence " , which is chiefly used by the team . <unk> Excellence calls for players and managers to focus on its five core values : integrity , unity , passion , <unk> and appreciation . 
 " <unk> " – <unk> represented each player 's individual commitment to season @-@ long improvement . There was a " U @-@ M Fuse Box " ( mock @-@ University of Michigan set of switches ) in the Men 's Basketball locker room in <unk> Center . Each player had selected one word on which to focus during the season and before every practice and game , each player flipped their switch " on . " This represented each player 's commitment to improvement every day . 
 Prior to the season , the five freshman were dubbed the " Fresh Five " , a moniker <unk> <unk> of the incoming freshman class of 1991 , known as the <unk> Five , that led Michigan to back @-@ to @-@ back Championship games while starting the majority of games .

By mid @-@ December of his freshman season , the students in the <unk> Rage ( Michigan student section at <unk> Arena ) had begun cheering <unk> on with such a flag . The Michigan Public & Media Relations office started mentioning the flag before Christmas . The flag was mentioned widely in the press as he continued his hot shooting into January . Through the first week of January , <unk> was shooting 53 @.@ 7 % on three @-@ point shots as the team held a 15 – 0 record . 
 The team , which represented Michigan Basketball for the ninety @-@ sixth season in the Big Ten Conference , is sometimes referred to as Team 96 or Squad 96 . Although this team represented Michigan for the ninety @-@ sixth consecutive year , there was controversy as to whether the team should in fact be marketed as Team 96 because the 1908 – 09 Michigan Wolverines men 's basketball team was not properly accounted for among the prior teams .

 <unk> theology ( sometimes referred to as the prosperity gospel , the health and wealth gospel , or the gospel of success ) is a religious belief among some Christians that financial blessing is the will of God for them , and that faith , positive speech , and donations ( possibly to Christian <unk> ) will increase one 's material wealth . They are based on interpretations of the Bible traditional in Judaism ( with respect to the Hebrew Bible ) , though less so in Christianity . <unk> theology views the Bible as a contract between God and humans : if humans have faith in God , he will deliver his promises of security and prosperity . <unk> these promises to be true is perceived as an act of faith , which God will honor . 
 The doctrine emphasizes the importance of personal <unk> , proposing that it is God 's will for his people to be happy . The <unk> ( reconciliation with God ) is interpreted to include the <unk> of sickness and poverty , which are viewed as <unk> to be broken by faith . This is believed to be achieved through donations of money , <unk> , and positive confession , and is often taught in mechanical and contractual terms . 
 <unk> theology has been criticized by leaders in the <unk> and <unk> movements , as well as other Christian denominations . These leaders maintain that it is irresponsible , promotes idolatry , and is contrary to scripture . Some critics have proposed that prosperity theology <unk> authoritarian organizations , with the leaders controlling the lives of the adherents . The doctrine has also become popular in South Korea ; academics have attributed some of its success to its parallels with the traditional <unk> culture . <unk> theology has drawn followers from the American middle class and poor , and has been likened to the cargo cult phenomenon , traditional African religion , and black liberation theology . 
 According to historian Kate <unk> , the prosperity gospel was formed from the intersection of three different <unk> : <unk> , New Thought , and " an American gospel of <unk> , <unk> , and upward mobility . " This " American gospel " was best exemplified by Andrew Carnegie 's Gospel of <unk> and Russell <unk> 's famous sermon " Acres of Diamonds " , in which <unk> equated poverty with sin and asserted that anyone could become rich through hard work . This gospel of wealth , however , was an expression of <unk> Christianity and understood success to be the result of personal effort rather than divine intervention . 
 The New Thought movement , which emerged in the 1880s , was responsible for popularizing belief in the power of the mind to achieve prosperity . While initially focused on achieving mental and physical health , New Thought teachers such as Charles <unk> made material success a major emphasis of the movement . By the 20th century , New Thought concepts had saturated American popular culture , being common features of both self @-@ help literature and popular psychology . 
 E. W. Kenyon , a Baptist minister and <unk> of the Higher Life movement , is credited with introducing mind @-@ power teachings into early <unk> . In the 1890s , Kenyon attended Emerson College of <unk> where he was exposed to the New Thought movement . Kenyon later became connected with well @-@ known <unk> leaders and wrote about supernatural revelation and positive declarations . His writing influenced leaders of the nascent prosperity movement during the post @-@ war American healing revival . Kenyon and later leaders in the prosperity movement have denied that he was influenced by the New Thought movement . <unk> Simon Coleman argues that there are " obvious parallels " between Kenyon 's teachings and New Thought . 
 Kenyon taught that Christ 's <unk> <unk> secured for <unk> a right to divine healing . This was attained through positive , faith @-@ filled speech ; the spoken word of God allowed <unk> to appropriate the same spiritual power that God used to create the world and attain the provisions promised in Christ 's death and resurrection . Prayer was understood to be a binding , legal act . Rather than asking , Kenyon taught <unk> to demand healing since they were already legally entitled to receive it . 
 Kenyon 's blend of evangelical religion and mind @-@ power beliefs — what he termed " overcoming faith " — <unk> with a small but influential segment of the <unk> movement . <unk> had always been committed to faith healing , and the movement also possessed a strong belief in the power of speech ( in particular speaking in <unk> and the use of the names of God , especially the name of Jesus ) . Kenyon 's ideas would be reflected in the teachings of <unk> <unk> F. F. Bosworth and John G. Lake ( who co @-@ led a congregation with New Thought author Albert C. <unk> prior to 1915 ) . 
 Oral Roberts began teaching prosperity theology in 1947 . He explained the laws of faith as a " blessing pact " in which God would return donations " seven fold " , promising that donors would receive back from unexpected sources the money they donated to him . Roberts offered to return any donation that did not lead to an equivalent unexpected payment . In the 1970s , Roberts characterized his blessing pact teaching as the " seed faith " doctrine : donations were a form of " seed " which would grow in value and be returned to the donor . Roberts began recruiting " partners " , wealthy donors who received exclusive conference invitations and ministry access in exchange for support . 
 In 1953 , faith <unk> A. A. Allen published The Secret to <unk> Financial Success and promoted merchandise such as " miracle tent <unk> " and prayer <unk> <unk> with " miracle oil " . In the late 1950s , Allen increasingly focused on prosperity . He taught that faith could <unk> solve financial problems and claimed to have had a <unk> experience in which God <unk> changed one @-@ dollar bills into twenty @-@ dollar bills to allow him to pay his debts . Allen taught the " word of faith " or the power to speak something into being . 
 In the 1960s , prosperity became a primary focus in healing revivals . T. L. <unk> began emphasizing prosperity in the 1960s and became known for his often <unk> displays of personal wealth . During that decade , Roberts and William <unk> criticized other prosperity <unk> , arguing that their fund @-@ raising tactics <unk> pressured attendees . These tactics were prompted in part by the expense of developing nationwide radio networks and campaign schedules . At the same time , leaders of the <unk> <unk> of God denomination often criticized the focus on prosperity taken by independent healing <unk> . 
 During the 1960s , prosperity gospel teachers embraced <unk> and came to dominate religious programming in the United States . Oral Roberts led the way , developing a syndicated weekly program that became the most watched religious show in the United States . By 1968 , television had <unk> the tent meeting in his ministry . 
 Reverend Ike , a pastor from New York City , began preaching about prosperity in the late 1960s . He soon had widely aired radio and television programs and became distinguished for his <unk> style . His <unk> about love for material possessions and teachings about the " Science of the Mind " led many <unk> to distance themselves from him . 
 In the 1980s , public attention in the United States was drawn to prosperity theology through the influence of prominent <unk> such as Jim <unk> . <unk> 's influence <unk> , however , after he was implicated in a high @-@ profile scandal . In the aftermath , Trinity Broadcasting Network ( <unk> ) emerged as the dominant force in prosperity <unk> , having brought Robert <unk> and Benny <unk> to prominence . 
 Although nearly all of the healing <unk> of the 1940s and ' 50s taught that faith could bring financial rewards , a new prosperity @-@ oriented teaching developed in the 1970s that differed from the one taught by <unk> <unk> of the 1950s . This " <unk> Confession " or " Word of Faith " movement taught that a Christian with faith can speak into existence anything consistent with the will of God . 
 Kenneth <unk> was credited with a key role in the expansion of prosperity theology . He founded the <unk> Bible Training Center in 1974 , and over the next 20 years , the school trained more than 10 @,@ 000 students in his theology . As is true of other prosperity movements , there is no theological governing body for the Word of Faith movement , and well @-@ known <unk> differ on some theological issues . The teachings of Kenneth <unk> have been described by Candy <unk> Brown of Indiana University as the most " orthodox " form of Word of Faith prosperity teaching . 
 The Neo @-@ <unk> movement has been characterized in part by an emphasis on prosperity theology , which gained greater acceptance within charismatic Christianity during the late 1990s . By 2006 , three of the four largest congregations in the United States were teaching prosperity theology , and Joel <unk> has been credited with spreading it outside of the <unk> and <unk> movement through his books , which have sold over 4 million copies . Bruce Wilkinson 's The Prayer of <unk> also sold millions of copies and invited readers to seek prosperity . 
 By the 2000s , adherents of prosperity theology in the United States were most common in the Sun Belt . In the late 2000s , proponents claimed that tens of millions of Christians had accepted prosperity theology . A 2006 poll by Time reported that 17 percent of Christians in America said they identified with the movement . There is no official governing body for the movement , though many <unk> are unofficially linked . 
 <unk> theology teaches that Christians are entitled to well @-@ being and , because physical and spiritual <unk> are seen as one <unk> reality , this is interpreted as physical health and economic prosperity . Teachers of the doctrine focus on personal <unk> , promoting a positive view of the spirit and body . They maintain that Christians have been given power over creation because they are made in the image of God and teach that positive confession allows Christians to exercise dominion over their souls and material objects around them . <unk> of the movement view the <unk> as providing for the <unk> of sickness , poverty , and spiritual corruption ; poverty and illness are cast as <unk> which can be broken by faith and righteous actions . There are , however , some prosperity churches which seek a more moderate or reformed paradigm of prosperity . <unk> Caldwell , pastor of a Methodist mega @-@ church , supports a theology of abundant life , teaching prosperity for the whole human being , which he sees as a path to combating poverty . 
 <unk> is interpreted in prosperity theology as a blessing from God , obtained through a spiritual law of positive confession , <unk> , and donations . This process is often taught in almost mechanical terms ; Kenneth <unk> , an American author and <unk> , argues that prosperity is governed by laws , while other teachers portray the process <unk> . Journalists David van <unk> and Jeff Chu of Time have described Word of Faith pastor <unk> Dollar 's teachings about prosperity as an <unk> contract between God and humanity . 
 The prosperity theology teaching of positive confession stems from its proponents ' view of scripture . The Bible is seen as a faith contract between God and <unk> ; God is understood to be faithful and just , so <unk> must fulfill their end of the contract to receive God 's promises . This leads to a belief in positive confession , the doctrine that <unk> may claim whatever they desire from God , simply by speaking it . <unk> theology teaches that the Bible has promised prosperity for <unk> , so positive confession means that <unk> are speaking in faith what God has already spoken about them . <unk> confession is practiced to bring about what is already believed in ; faith itself is a confession , and speaking it brings it into reality . 
 The teaching is often based on non @-@ traditional interpretations of Bible verses , the Book of <unk> often being given special attention . While <unk> has generally been celebrated by Christians for its passages about the <unk> , teachers of prosperity theology usually draw attention to its descriptions of physical wealth . <unk> quoted verses include : 
 <unk> 3 : 10 : " <unk> to the <unk> a full tenth of what you earn so there will be food in my house . Test me in this , " says the Lord All @-@ Powerful . " I will open the windows of heaven for you and pour out all the blessings you need " ( <unk> ) . 
 John 10 : 10 : " I am come that they might have life , and that they might have it more <unk> " ( <unk> ) . 
 <unk> 4 : 19 : " My God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus " ( <unk> ) . 
 3 John 1 : 2 : " Beloved , I wish above all things that thou <unk> <unk> and be in health , even as thy soul <unk> " ( <unk> ) . 
 <unk> theology casts itself as the <unk> of true doctrine and thus part of a path to Christian dominion over secular society . It contends that God 's promises of prosperity and victory to Israel in the Old Testament apply to New @-@ Covenant Christians today , and that faith and holy actions release this prosperity . C. Peter Wagner , a leader of the New Apostolic Reformation , has argued that if Christians take dominion over aspects of society , the Earth will experience " peace and prosperity " . Some Latin Americans who have embraced prosperity theology argue that Christianity has historically placed an unnecessary focus on suffering . They often view this as a Roman Catholic doctrine that should be discarded and replaced with an emphasis on prosperity . <unk> theology advocates also argue that biblical promises of blessings awaiting the poor have been <unk> <unk> , and should be understood literally . 
 <unk> churches place a strong emphasis on the importance of giving . Some services include a teaching time focused on giving and prosperity , including Biblical references to <unk> ; and then a sermon on another topic which follows the offering . <unk> church leaders often claim a specific blessing can be exchanged for the money being donated to their ministry ; some have been reported to instruct <unk> to hold their donations above their heads during the prayer . 
 <unk> in prosperity churches are encouraged to speak positive statements about aspects of their lives that they wish to see improved . These statements , known as positive <unk> , ( distinct from <unk> of sin ) are said to <unk> change aspects of people 's lives if spoken with faith . <unk> churches also encourage people to " live without limits " and <unk> optimism about their lives . T. D. <unk> , pastor of The Potter 's House non @-@ denominational mega @-@ church , has argued in favor of prosperity , rejecting what he sees as the <unk> of success . He views poverty as a barrier to living a Christian life , suggesting that it is easier to make a positive impact on society when one is affluent . 
 While some prosperity churches have a reputation for manipulating and <unk> the poor , many are involved in social programs . <unk> these programs is a theology of <unk> and human flourishing with the goal of releasing people from a " welfare " or " victim " mentality . Many prosperity churches hold <unk> on financial responsibility . Kate <unk> , an academic who studies prosperity theology , has criticized such <unk> , arguing that though they contain some sound advice the <unk> often emphasize the purchase of expensive possessions . Hanna <unk> of The Atlantic argues that prosperity theology contributed to the housing bubble that caused the late @-@ 2000s financial crisis . She maintains that home ownership was heavily emphasized in prosperity churches , based on reliance on divine financial intervention that led to <unk> choices based on actual financial ability . 
 In the 2000s , churches teaching prosperity theology saw significant growth in the Third World . According to Philip Jenkins of Pennsylvania State University , poor citizens of impoverished countries often find the doctrine appealing because of their economic <unk> and the doctrine 's emphasis on miracles . One region seeing explosive growth is Western Africa , particularly Nigeria . In the Philippines , the El <unk> movement , part of the Catholic <unk> <unk> , has spread prosperity theology outside Protestant Christianity . One South Korean prosperity church , <unk> Full Gospel Church , gained attention in the 1990s by claiming to be the world 's largest congregation . 
 Most churches in the prosperity movement are non @-@ denominational and independent , though some groups have formed networks . <unk> churches typically reject Presbyterian polity ( or governance ) and the idea that a pastor should be <unk> to elders ; it is common for <unk> of prosperity churches to be the highest <unk> authority figure . Critics , including Sarah <unk> and Joe <unk> , maintain that prosperity teachers <unk> authoritarian organizations . They argue that leaders attempt to control the lives of adherents by claiming divinely bestowed authority . Jenkins contends that prosperity theology is used as a tool to justify the high salaries of <unk> . 
 In the United States , the movement has drawn many followers from the middle class and is most popular in commuter towns and urban areas . In <unk> the American Gospel : Global Christian <unk> Steve <unk> , Paul <unk> , and Susan Rose speculate that the movement was fueled by a prevailing disdain for social <unk> in the United States that began in the 1970s . <unk> argues that prosperity theology emerged because of broader trends , particularly American economic optimism in the 1950s and 1990s . Tony Lin of the University of Virginia has also compared the teaching to manifest destiny , the 19th @-@ century belief that the United States was entitled to the West . Marvin Harris argues that the doctrine 's focus on the material world is a symptom of the <unk> of American religion . He sees it as an attempt to fulfill the American Dream by using supernatural power . 
 <unk> theology has become popular among poor Americans , particularly those who seek personal and social advancement . It has seen significant growth in black and Hispanic churches and is particularly popular among immigrants . <unk> for the movement note its ethnic diversity and argue that it encompasses a variety of views . Joel <unk> of Cambridge University notes that most <unk> attribute the theology 's appeal to the poor — especially in the Global South — to the fact that it promises security and helps explain capitalism . Simon Coleman developed a theory based on the doctrine 's rhetoric and the feeling of belonging it gave parishioners . In a study of the Swedish Word of Life Church , he noted that members felt part of a complex gift @-@ exchange system , giving to God and then awaiting a gift in return ( either from God directly or through another church member ) . <unk> Church , the largest congregation in Australia , teaches a form of prosperity theology that emphasizes personal success . Marion <unk> has argued that this message has drawn a significant number of <unk> mobile Australians . 
 Historian Carter <unk> of Boston University has drawn parallels between contemporary prosperity theology and the medieval indulgence trade . Coleman notes that several pre @-@ 20th century Christian movements in the United States taught that a holy lifestyle was a path to prosperity and that God @-@ ordained hard work would bring blessing . 
 Coleman has speculated that modern @-@ day prosperity theology <unk> heavily from the New Thought movement , though he admits that the connection is sometimes unclear . Jenkins notes that critics draw a parallel between prosperity theology and the cargo cult phenomenon . While citing the popularity of prosperity theology in agrarian African communities , he argues that it can also bear similarities to traditional African religious rituals . J. Matthew Wilson of Southern Methodist University compares the movement to Black liberation theology owing to its focus on <unk> <unk> groups , though he notes that it differs in its concentration on individual success rather than corporate political change . 
 Other critics of the movement <unk> promises made by its leaders , arguing that the broad freedom from problems they promise is irresponsible . <unk> are often criticized for <unk> the faith of their listeners by <unk> themselves through large donations . <unk> theology has been opposed for not adequately explaining the poverty of the Apostles . For instance , some theologians believe that the life and writings of Paul the <unk> , who is believed to have experienced significant suffering during his ministry , are particularly in conflict with prosperity theology . <unk> <unk> , religion writer in an opinion piece in the Washington Post , points to the conflict with basic Christian teachings " Jesus was born poor , and he died poor . During his earthly tenure , he spoke time and again about the importance of spiritual wealth and health . When he talked about material wealth , it was usually part of a <unk> tale . " 
 In 1980 , the General Council of the <unk> of God criticized the doctrine of positive confession , noting examples of negative <unk> in the Bible ( where Biblical figures express fears and doubts ) that had positive results and contrasting these examples with the focus on positive <unk> taught by prosperity theology . The Council argues that the biblical Greek word often translated as " confess " literally translates as " to speak the same thing " , and refers to both positive and negative <unk> . The statement also criticizes the doctrine for failing to recognize the will of God : God 's will should have precedence over the will of man , including their desires for wealth , and Christians should " recognize the sovereignty of God " . The statement further criticizes prosperity theology for overlooking the importance of prayer , arguing that prayer should be used for all requests , not simply positive confession . The Council noted that Christians should expect suffering in this life . They urge readers to apply practical tests to positive confession , arguing that the doctrine appeals to those who are already in affluent societies but that many Christians in other societies are impoverished or imprisoned . Finally , the paper criticizes the distinction made by advocates of prosperity theology in the two Greek words that mean " speaking " , arguing that the distinction is false and that they are used <unk> in the Greek text . The Council accused prosperity theology of taking passages out of context to fulfill its own needs , with the result that doctrine of positive confession is contradictory to the <unk> message of the Bible . 
 On the August 16 , 2015 episode of his HBO weekly series Last Week Tonight , John Oliver <unk> prosperity theology by announcing that he had established his own tax @-@ exempt church , called Our Lady of <unk> <unk> . In a lengthy segment , Oliver focused on what he characterized as the predatory conduct of <unk> who appeal for repeated gifts from people in financial distress or personal <unk> , and he criticized the very loose requirements for entities to obtain tax exempt status as churches under U.S. tax law . Oliver said that he would ultimately donate any money collected by the church to Doctors Without Borders .

 Newton House is a Grade II * listed country house situated just to the west of the market town of <unk> in <unk> , Wales . It is owned and maintained by the National Trust and lies within <unk> Park ( sometimes <unk> as " <unk> " ) and the grounds of <unk> Castle . The original house was built during the Medieval period on a site which has been occupied for at least two millennia . The current house was built by Edward Rice in the <unk> style in 1660 , though extensive changes were made in the 1850s in the Venetian Gothic style . The house played a role in the Rebecca <unk> of 1843 , when the <unk> of the house at the time , Colonel George Rice , received a death threat with an empty grave dug in the ground . After 1956 the property fell into turbulent times when two owners died within the space of a few years . It was sold in 1974 , and later fell into disrepair ; it was occupied by squatters and thieves who removed beams and furniture . 
 The house , along with <unk> Castle , have since been restored by the National Trust and Cadw respectively . It is a three @-@ storey <unk> structure , built from grey stone , with four tall towers in each corner , with sloping slate roofs . The front features a grand central porch . Two rooms are open to the public , including a <unk> and exhibition in the basement and ground floor which contain numerous displays related to the history of the estate and occupants . The deer park which surrounds the property was <unk> by <unk> Brown in 1775 . The surrounding woodland consists mainly of oak and <unk> <unk> . Newton House is cited as one of the most haunted houses in Wales , noted in particular for its ghost of Walter the Butler , a former employee whose tobacco smoke purportedly <unk> through the air . 
 <unk> Park has a history of occupation spanning at least two millennia . A polished stone axe dated to the Neolithic period was unearthed on the site in 1976 , and during the Iron Age , a farm existed on the property . The Romans later built a pair of forts here , with one partly <unk> the other . There are traces of Roman roads and tracks , some of which may have been part of the <unk> @-@ <unk> Roman road . A Roman milestone and a coin hoard were unearthed near <unk> Castle , and pieces of amphorae and <unk> items have been excavated near <unk> Farm . 
 During the 12th century , <unk> Castle was built by Lord Rhys . The castle and grounds were seized by Henry VIII in <unk> , and the estate owners , who changed their family surname to Rice , subsequently had to buy back their property from the Crown . The family were elevated to the peerage of Great Britain as Baron <unk> . Mary I is documented to have restored some of the land back to the Rhys family , but it was not until the reign of Charles I that the family fully regained their properties . 
 Newton House was originally built during the medieval period at some distance from the castle . It is documented to have been later modified in <unk> and 1603 . The current Newton House was completed in 1660 under the command of Edward Rice . In the late <unk> , George Rice and his wife Cecil began the construction of a landscape garden , and hired eminent architect <unk> Brown in 1775 to assume responsibility for the development . <unk> and <unk> were added between <unk> and <unk> , giving the property a more <unk> appearance . During the Rebecca <unk> of 1843 , Colonel George Rice was <unk> one night in September and found an empty grave dug in the grounds , warning him that he would be buried in it by October 10 . 
 Newton House fell into a turbulent period after the death of the 7th Baron <unk> in 1956 . His son Charles Arthur <unk> , the 8th Baron , died just six years later , and most of the estate and a number of family 's assets had to be sold off to pay duties . In 1974 , the property was sold by the current Baron <unk> , and later fell into disrepair : it was occupied by squatters and thieves who removed beams and furniture . The house , along with <unk> Castle , have since been restored by Cadw and the National Trust respectively . The National Trust acquired the deer park in 1987 and Newton House three years later . 
 The house contains several paintings of note , including William Powell <unk> 's Mary , Queen of Scots <unk> <unk> to France ( <unk> ) and Godfrey <unk> 's portrait of the Bishop of Salisbury , William <unk> , dated to <unk> . Two <unk> at the house are open to the public . Aside from the <unk> , the exhibition in the basement and ground floor contains numerous displays related to the Rhys family , the history of the estate and World War II , and is designed as if the year is 1912 . 
 The house is surrounded by a deer park which was <unk> by <unk> Brown from 1775 . He established a winding path , known as <unk> Brown path , through the park and planted deciduous trees in key places to frame the house and castle . The deer park contains notable herds of rare White Park cattle and fallow deer . A small garden behind the house , overlooking the deer park , <unk> in style with a central fountain , has been restored to its former glory . Brown 's beech clumps survive in the present day . 
 The manuscript came from <unk> , a Greek island , and has survived in a fragmentary condition . It was brought to England in 1821 and transferred to Cambridge University in 1985 . It is often cited in critical editions of the Greek New Testament . 
 The lower text of the manuscript contains fragments of the chapters 1 : 1 @-@ 11 : 33 of the Gospel of Luke . The <unk> comprises 86 thick , coarse <unk> leaves and three partial leaves ; it measures 36 x 29 cm . The text was written in a single column with well @-@ formed <unk> script . The letters are large , round and narrow , without <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , or accents . The manuscript was written by two scribes . 
 The <unk> uses a peculiar system of chapter divisions , which it shares with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> . A more common system divides chapters according to their titles . The capital letters at the beginnings of sections stand out in the margin as in the <unk> <unk> and <unk> . 
 The book contains the following chapters and verses of the Gospel of Luke : 1 : 1 @-@ 9 @,@ 19 @-@ 23 @,@ 27 @-@ 28 @,@ 30 @-@ 32 @,@ 36 @-@ 60 @,@ 77 ; 2 : 19 @,@ 21 @-@ 22 @,@ 33 @-@ 3 ; 3 : 5 @-@ 8 @,@ 11 @-@ 20 ; 4 : 1 @-@ 2 @,@ 6 @-@ 20 @,@ 32 @-@ 43 ; 5 : 17 @-@ 36 ; 6 : 21 ; 7 : 6 @,@ 11 @-@ 37 @,@ 39 @-@ 47 ; 8 : 4 @-@ 21 @,@ 25 @-@ 35 @,@ 43 @-@ 50 ; 9 : 1 @-@ 28 @,@ 32 @-@ 33 @,@ 35 ; 9 : 41 ; 10 : 18 @,@ 21 @-@ 40 ; 11 : 1 @-@ 4 @,@ 24 @-@ 33 . 
 The textual character of the <unk> is representative of the late Alexandrian text @-@ type , and is similar to the <unk> <unk> . Kurt and Barbara <unk> gave the following textual profile of it : 21 , 82 , 21 / 2 , 3s . This means the text of the <unk> agrees with the Byzantine standard text 2 times , it agrees 8 times with the original text against the Byzantine and it agrees both with the Byzantine and original text 2 times . There are 3 independent or distinctive readings . On the basis of this profile <unk> considered the quality of the text to suit his Category III . According to the <unk> <unk> Method , it represents the Alexandrian text in Luke 10 and mixed Byzantine text @-@ type in Luke 1 , which probably indicates sporadic Byzantine corrections . 
 The text of the <unk> is cited in some critical editions of the Greek New Testament ( <unk> ) in the following places : Matthew 10 : 4 ; 11 : 17 ; 12 : 47 ; 13 : 13 ; 14 : 22 ; 18 : 10 ; 22 : 30 ; 26 : 27 ; 28 : 9 ; Mark 1 : 27 ; 2 : 10 @.@ 26 ; 4 : 16 @.@ 20 ; 6 : 2 @.@ 2 @.@ 3 @.@ 33 . It is not cited in <unk> . 
 <unk> dated the manuscript to the 8th century . <unk> was aware that the handwriting is typical for the 6th century , but the handwriting of the commentary is much older . The letters <unk> are round , high , and narrow , and could not have been written before the 8th century . C. R. Gregory supported <unk> 's point of view . According to Nicholas <unk> , the manuscript could not have been written before the 6th century nor after the 8th century . 
 William <unk> in 1937 , on the basis of <unk> data , suggested that the <unk> should be dated to the 6th century . It does not use <unk> and accents and the text of the commentary is written in <unk> script . <unk> supported <unk> 's point of view . This date is accepted by the majority of scholars . 
 David C. Parker in 2004 argued that manuscript was written later the 6th century , because it has a small number of square letters , and the handwriting is not typical for the 6th century . Some letters were compressed ( <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ) , the bar over the letter <unk> is short and the letter <unk> is written in several ways . According to Parker the manuscript should be dated to the 7th century . 
 The early history of the manuscript is unknown . In 1821 it was brought by general Colin <unk> to England from the Greek island <unk> in the <unk> Sea . The manuscript was placed in the library of the British and Foreign Bible Society ( <unk> 24 ) in London . 
 Nicholas <unk> found errors in <unk> ' edition , but William <unk> thought it satisfactory . J. Harold <unk> corrected <unk> ' errors and edited the list of corrections in 1957 , which was examined by William <unk> . In 1959 <unk> published a commentary . The <unk> probably needs another examination with modern technology . 
 In 1985 it was moved to the Cambridge University Library ( <unk> <unk> 213 ) . In December 2013 , the Bible Society announced plans to sell some manuscripts , among them the <unk> <unk> , to raise funds for a <unk> Centre in Wales . The University was given right of first refusal and has until February 2014 to raise the money to acquire the <unk> . 
 Ernest Cotton Deane MC ( 4 May 1887 – 25 September 1915 ) was a medical officer of the British Indian Army and an Irish international rugby player . Born in the city of Limerick , Ireland , he went to school in Kingstown ( present day <unk> <unk> ) in County Dublin and then studied medicine at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland ( <unk> ) , graduating in 1909 . He was selected to play rugby for Ireland in one match , against England in February 1909 . His rugby career was cut short when he broke his leg in a match against Oxford University . 
 Deane was commissioned into the Royal Army Medical Corps in 1911 , after a period as house surgeon at the Adelaide Hospital , Dublin . In 1913 , he was posted to India and served in Burma . He was stationed in <unk> at the start of the First World War . From there , he travelled to France with the <unk> Brigade of the Indian Expeditionary Force , landing in Marseille in September 1914 . He was deployed immediately to the Western Front , where he served first with the 20th Field Ambulance and then as medical officer of the 2nd Battalion , The Royal <unk> Regiment . His unit saw much active service . On 22 August 1915 , he was awarded the Military Cross after running out under machine gun fire to rescue four men who had been wounded by artillery fire . A month later , his regiment participated in the Battle of <unk> , and was almost entirely obliterated . He was shot dead after going to help some injured soldiers : his action earned him a mention in despatches . Deane was one of 60 <unk> doctors to receive the Military Cross in the First World War , and one of 17 to be killed in action . 
 Ernest Deane , born in the city of Limerick , Ireland on 4 May 1887 , was the third of the four sons of Thomas and <unk> Deane of Kingstown ( present day <unk> <unk> ) , County Dublin . He went to <unk> School , Kingstown , from 1901 to 1904 then went on to study medicine at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland from 1904 to 1909 . He became house surgeon at the Adelaide Hospital , Dublin . 
 Deane was an all @-@ round <unk> , skilled in golf , lawn tennis , horse @-@ riding and shooting . Furthermore , at <unk> , Deane was captain of the school 's rugby XV , and later he captained the Adelaide Hospital XV , and the <unk> XV . He was selected to play wing for Ireland in the match against England at Lansdowne Road , Dublin , on 13 February 1909 , which Ireland lost 5 – 11 . It was England 's first victory on Irish soil since 1895 . Deane 's opposite number that day was the New Zealand @-@ born Alexander Palmer of London Hospital FC , whose speed allowed him to get around Deane , and to score two of England 's three tries , and a conversion . 
 At the start of the next season , on 29 November 1909 , Deane was part of the <unk> team to play Oxford University . During the game , he collided with Robert Bourne , breaking his own leg and bringing his rugby career to an end . 
 At the start of the 20th century , many Irish doctors joined the British armed forces . Deane himself was commissioned temporary lieutenant in the Royal Army Medical Corps ( RAMC ) on 28 July 1911 , confirmed 9 February 1912 . In October 1913 , he went to India and served in Burma . He was stationed at <unk> when the First World War broke out . He went to France with the <unk> Brigade of the 7th ( <unk> ) Division of the Indian Expeditionary Force , arriving in <unk> on 26 September 1914 . He was attached to the 20th Field Ambulance , and later served as medical officer of the 2nd Battalion , The Royal <unk> Regiment , in active service on the Western Front . 
 A few days before he died , Deane was awarded the Military Cross , one of 60 awarded to <unk> doctors in the war . Frederick Conway <unk> , president of the <unk> , proudly read out Deane 's citation in an address to students of the college , and commended recent <unk> to enter the RAMC . The citation in the Gazette said : 
 For conspicuous gallantry on 22nd August 1915 , near <unk> . A standing patrol 120 yards in front of our line was bombed by the enemy at about 10 p.m. , the only <unk> being two loud bomb explosions . Captain Deane , without any knowledge of the enemy 's strength , at once got over the parapet and ran by himself to the spot under rifle and machine gun fire . Finding four wounded men he returned for <unk> and got them back into safety . This is not the first time that Captain Deane 's gallantry under fire has been brought to notice . 
 On 25 September , Deane 's battalion , the 2nd <unk> , took part in the Battle of <unk> , in a diversionary attack by the Indian Corps to draw away German reserves from the main attack . According to the personal account of George <unk> <unk> , after the battle , the battalion ceased to exist , and most of the other regiments of the <unk> Division were decimated . The artillery bombardment prior to the infantry assault had failed to destroy all of the German barbed wire defences , and some men got caught up in them . Deane went to help . Returning across the open , he was killed instantly by a bullet to the head . His Colonel , who was himself badly wounded , wrote to his family saying : 
 He was the most <unk> fellow I ever met , and we all loved him in the regiment , both officers and men . He was just a part of us , and the few of us left <unk> his loss very deeply . We had a big battle on the 25th , and your son went out to try and help some wounded in and got killed . I believe his death was <unk> , but I am not sure , as I was wounded myself , and had to be taken back . His body was recovered and was buried by our <unk> , and I will give you exact location of cemetery afterwards . Everyone knew Deane as one of the <unk> of the brave , and it was only the other day that he got one of the best deserved and <unk> won honours , when he was awarded the Military Cross . 
 Captain Ernest Deane was one of 17 <unk> doctors killed in action during the war . He is buried at the Rue @-@ du @-@ <unk> No 1 Military Cemetery ( Grave <unk> ) , <unk> , France . 
 <unk> as the principal chief of the Lake Superior <unk> ( <unk> ) for nearly a half @-@ century until his death in 1855 , he led his nation into a treaty relationship with the United States Government . He signed treaties in 1825 , 1826 , 1837 , 1842 , 1847 , and 1854 . He was instrumental in resisting the efforts of the United States to remove the <unk> to western areas and secured permanent Indian reservations for his people near Lake Superior . 
 <unk> was born around the year 1759 at La <unk> on Madeline Island ( <unk> ) in the <unk> region . Now part of Wisconsin , La <unk> was a key <unk> village and trading center for the empire of New France , which was engaged in the Seven Years ' War with Great Britain at the time of <unk> 's birth . Throughout the 18th century , the <unk> spread out from La <unk> into lands conquered from the Dakota people , and settled several village sites . These bands in the western Lake Superior and Mississippi River regions regarded La <unk> as their " ancient capital " and center for spirituality . It had also become a center of trade . 
 Traditional <unk> government and society centers around kinship clans , each of which was symbolized by animal <unk> . Each <unk> had a traditional responsibility within the tribe . <unk> , or Buffalo as he was known to Europeans , belonged to the <unk> clan . 
 Although the <unk> were afforded respect as principal peace chiefs , this status was not permanent . The <unk> , led in Buffalo 's time by his sub @-@ chief <unk> , maintained that they were the hereditary chiefs . They said the <unk> ' status as <unk> <unk> upon recognition by the <unk> . A chief 's power in <unk> society was based on persuasion and consensus ; it was contingent , holding only as long as the community of elders , including the women , chose to respect and follow the chief 's lead . 
 Sources conflict as to the identity of Buffalo 's father , who may also have been named <unk> . He appears to have been a descendant or relative of the famous war chief <unk> . When he was about 10 , Buffalo and his parents moved from La <unk> to the vicinity of what now is Buffalo , New York , and lived there until about he was about 12 . The family then relocated to the Mackinac Island area for a while before returning to La <unk> . In his youth , he was admired as a skilled hunter and athlete . 
 In his long life , Buffalo had five wives and numerous children , many of whom became prominent <unk> leaders in the reservation era . He practiced the <unk> religion . He converted to Roman Catholicism on his death bed . 
 Details on Buffalo 's early life are sparse . Although he appears to have been favored by British traders and decorated by British authorities , few <unk> from Lake Superior fought in either the American Revolution or the War of 1812 . There is no record of Buffalo participating . 
 When <unk> 's War broke out , Buffalo and a number of other young warriors from the La <unk> area abandoned the <unk> for a time to follow the teachings of the <unk> prophet <unk> . While en route to <unk> to join the attack on the Americans , they were stopped by Michel <unk> , the respected Métis fur trader from La <unk> . <unk> convinced Buffalo and the others that it would be fruitless to fight the Americans . 
 After that incident , Buffalo is recorded as using only peaceful tactics in his relations with the United States , though he often opposed US Indian policy . He also drew a contrast between himself and his contemporaries <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> and Hole in the Day , two <unk> chiefs from present @-@ day Minnesota , who carried out a long war against the Dakota Sioux people . Although Armstrong records Buffalo winning a large victory over the Dakota in the 1842 Battle of the <unk> , 20th @-@ century historians have cast doubt on his account . That year Buffalo was recorded as saying he " never took a <unk> in his life , though he had taken prisoners whom he fed and well @-@ treated . " Overall , he seems to have supported efforts at peace between the <unk> and Dakota . 
 Buffalo inherited not only the status afforded his family , but also had skills praised in his grandfather <unk> . Noted for his abilities in hunting and battle , it was through his speaking abilities that Buffalo was recognized as chief by his people . By the time the <unk> of Wisconsin and Minnesota started treaty negotiations with the US Government , Buffalo was recognized as one of the primary <unk> for all the bands , not just for the <unk> from La <unk> . 
 A year later , the Treaty of Fond du Lac was signed at a meeting at the western edge of Lake Superior . The <unk> were listed by band , and Buffalo , recorded as <unk> , signed as the first chief from La <unk> . The treaty , mainly dealing with mineral rights for <unk> lands in what is now Michigan , had little immediate effect but foreshadowed future treaties . Buffalo did not speak on the copper issue . He praised the US officials for their ability to keep their young people under their control ; he asked for whiskey to accomplish the same ends among the younger members of his band . When the agent presented him with a silver medal as a symbol of his <unk> , he explained that his power stemmed from his clan and reputation , and not from anything received from the U.S. Government . 
 Shortly after the treaties , Henry <unk> Schoolcraft , acting in his capacity as US Indian agent , visited La <unk> . He reprimanded Buffalo for not stopping the continuing sporadic warfare between the <unk> and Dakota . Buffalo replied that he was unable to stop the young men of Lac <unk> <unk> , St. Croix , Lac du <unk> or other bands beyond La <unk> from going against the Dakota . Historians take this to mean that while he was regarded as the head spokesman of the <unk> in Wisconsin , he could not control the day @-@ to @-@ day affairs of all the bands , which were highly <unk> , particularly about warfare . Buffalo also said that , unlike the British before the War of 1812 , the U.S. Government had not done enough to help maintain the peace among the tribes . 
 In the next decades , there was pressure from Americans who wanted to exploit the mineral and timber resources of <unk> country , and the US government sought to acquire control of the territory through treaties . The <unk> of 1837 and 1842 covered La <unk> and territories held by other bands over which Buffalo held considerable influence . In both treaties , Americans recognized Buffalo 's position as the principal chief of all the Lake Superior <unk> . 
 In the Treaty of St. Peters ( 1837 ) , the government sought the pine timber resources on <unk> lands . They intended to float the harvested timber southwest into the Mississippi River . The negotiations took place at Fort Snelling , near present @-@ day Minneapolis . The <unk> from Minnesota and the St. Croix area arrived first and began discussions on July 20 . The assembled chiefs awaited the judgment of Buffalo before deciding to approve the treaty . Despite the <unk> of the territorial governor , Henry Dodge , the negotiations were delayed for five days as the assembled bands waited for Buffalo to arrive . While other chiefs spoke about the terms of mineral rights and annuity amounts , Buffalo discussed treatment of the mixed @-@ blood traders , stating : 
 I am an Indian and do not know the value of money , but the half @-@ breeds do , for which reason we wish you pay them their share in money . You have good judgment in what you do , and if you do not act yourself , you will appoint someone else to divide it between the half breeds . ... I have good reasons for saying to you what I have just said ; for at a certain Treaty held <unk> , there were some who got rich while others received nothing . 
 " The Indians acted like children ; they tried to <unk> each other and got cheated themselves . When it comes my turn to sell my land , I do not think I shall give it up as they did . " Regarding possible future land <unk> , he said : " Father I speak for my people , not for myself . I am an old man . My fire is almost out — there is but little smoke . When I sit in my <unk> & smoke my pipe , I think of what has past and what is to come , and it makes my heart shake . When business comes before us , we will try and act like Chiefs . If any thing is to be done , it had better be done straight . " 
 Five years later , Buffalo was presented with the Treaty of La <unk> covering his lands . Acting Superintendent of Indian Affairs Henry Stuart , who was promoting development of the Lake Superior copper industry , led the negotiations for the US government . No record of the negotiations was made . But materials written by missionaries , traders , and the <unk> through their agent indicated that Stuart used bullying and outright deception to force the <unk> to accept the terms . 
 Buffalo signed and was recorded as <unk> <unk> , 1st chief of La <unk> . Writing in 1855 , <unk> describes Buffalo 's " voice so potent at the treaty of ' 42 . " However , three months after the treaty , Buffalo dictated a letter to the government in Washington D.C. , saying he was " <unk> " of the way the treaty was conducted . He said that Stuart had refused to listen to any objections by the <unk> , and that Buffalo wanted to add a provision to ensure permanent reservations for the Ojibwe in Wisconsin . 
 The interpretation of the 1837 and 1842 treaties remains ambiguous , as the US government claimed the <unk> ceded title to the lands , and the <unk> claiming they ceded only resource rights . The government had stated that the lands of the <unk> were unsuitable for farming and white settlement . The <unk> did obtain annuity payments to be paid each year at La <unk> , and reserved the right to hunt , fish , gather , and move across any lands outlined in the treaties . They obtained the promise that the nation would not be removed across the Mississippi River , unless they somehow " <unk> . " 
 In 1830 , President Andrew Jackson had signed the Indian <unk> Act , which authorized the government to remove any Indian nations east of the Mississippi River across to the western side and offer land in exchange . As northern Wisconsin was not then under pressure for development by white settlers , as occurred in the Southeast , the <unk> were not among the first targets of the act . They watched closely as the government used the territorial claims defined by tribes in 1825 to force numerous tribes in Indiana , southern Michigan and southern Wisconsin to move west to Kansas , Iowa , Minnesota , and Indian Territory , present @-@ day Oklahoma . These included the <unk> and <unk> , two <unk> tribes closely related to and allied with the <unk> . 
 In 1848 , Wisconsin achieved statehood ; Indian nations were under increased pressure for removal and <unk> . <unk> US Indian agents controlled annuity payments , sometimes <unk> tribes , and took authority not granted them by the bands . They allowed white settlers to move onto <unk> lands and refused the Ojibwe the rights reserved by treaties . The <unk> complained to the President about the mistreatment and broken promises , but politicians were more <unk> to listen to western land <unk> , who saw possibilities for profit in removing the <unk> to Minnesota . 
 Even with the treaties of 1837 and 1842 , leaders worried about <unk> removal . Buffalo kept in constant contact with the other bands to ensure the <unk> upheld their obligations . He sent runners to all the bands to report back on any conduct by the <unk> that could construed as grounds for removal . Nothing was reported . But , President Zachary Taylor signed the removal order on February 6 , 1850 , under corrupt circumstances , claiming to be protecting the <unk> from " <unk> " whites . The Wisconsin legislature resisted the order and put aside plans for removal . Alexander Ramsey , the territorial governor of Minnesota , and Indian sub @-@ agent John <unk> conspired on a plan to force the <unk> to Minnesota anyway , as the two men stood to gain personal economic and political benefits from removal . 
 To force the <unk> to comply , the <unk> <unk> announced he would pay future <unk> only at Sandy Lake , Minnesota instead of La <unk> , where they had been paid previously . This change resulted in the Sandy Lake <unk> , when hundreds of <unk> <unk> or died of exposure in Minnesota and on the journey home because the promised annuity supplies were late , contaminated or inadequate . 
 And when a message was sent to me by our Indian agent to come and get our pay , I lost no time in arising & <unk> with my Agents voice and when I reached my point of destination , <unk> my Agent fed me with very bad flour it resembled green clay . Soon I became sick and many of my fellow <unk> also were taken sick , and soon the results were <unk> by the death of over two hundred persons of my tribe , for this <unk> , I laid blame to the provisions issued to us ... 
 Back in La <unk> , Buffalo took several actions to <unk> and prevent removal . He and other leaders petitioned the US government for the next two years to no <unk> . They did win considerable sympathy from whites who learned of the <unk> in Sandy Lake . Newspapers throughout the Lake Superior region ran <unk> condemning the removal effort . Buffalo sent two of his sons to St. Paul , the state capital , where they obtained a portion of the <unk> still owed . 
 Ramsey and <unk> continued to work to remove the <unk> to Sandy Lake . <unk> said they considered Sandy Lake a " graveyard , " but he still tried to move all the bands to Fond du Lac . Young <unk> men in Wisconsin were outraged at these developments and the threat of violent revolt grew . Buffalo called on the services of his well @-@ spoken sub @-@ chief <unk> , and son @-@ in @-@ law Benjamin Armstrong , a literate white interpreter married to Buffalo 's daughter . He drew up a petition that the 92 @-@ year @-@ old Buffalo would personally deliver to the president in Washington . 
 After spring <unk> in 1852 , the elderly Buffalo , <unk> , Armstrong , and four others set out from La <unk> for Washington , D.C. by birch bark <unk> . Along the way , they stopped in towns and mining camps along the Michigan shore of Lake Superior , securing hundreds of signatures in support of their cause . At <unk> <unk> . Marie , they were held by the US Indian agent , who told them that no unauthorized <unk> <unk> could go to Washington and they had to turn back . The men pleaded the urgency of their case and traveled to Detroit by steamship . There another Indian agent tried to stop them . Once allowed to proceed , they sailed to Buffalo , New York and then on to Albany and New York City . 
 In New York City , the Ojibwe attracted attention , gaining publicity and money for their cause . In Washington , however , they were turned away by Indian Affairs , and told they should never have come in the first place . <unk> , they drew the attention of the Whig Congressman Briggs from New York , who was scheduled a meeting with President <unk> <unk> the next day . At the meeting , Buffalo rose first . He performed the pipe ceremony with a pipe made especially for the occasion . He had the younger chief <unk> speak for more than an hour about the broken treaty promises and the disastrous attempt at removal . <unk> agreed to consider the issues . The next day , he announced that the removal order would be canceled , annuity payments would be made at La <unk> , and another treaty would set up permanent reservations for the Ojibwe in Wisconsin . 
 The delegation traveled back to Wisconsin by rail , spreading the good news to the various <unk> bands as they went . Buffalo also announced that all the tribal representatives should gather at La <unk> for payments the next summer ( 1853 ) , and he would reveal the specifics of the agreement . 
 As promised by <unk> , treaty commissioners arrived in La <unk> in 1854 to conclude a final treaty . <unk> the experiences of 1837 and 1842 , the <unk> leaders sought to control the negotiations in 1854 . <unk> in those treaties had been partially to blame for ensuing problems , so Buffalo insisted he would accept no interpreter other than Armstrong , whom he referred to as his adopted son . The <unk> insisted on a guarantee of the right to hunt , fish , and gather on all the ceded territory , and on the establishment on several reservations across western Upper Michigan , northern Wisconsin , and northeastern <unk> in his mid @-@ <unk> and in failing health , Buffalo directed the negotiations but left most of the speaking to other chiefs .

 " Pam 's <unk> " relates to Pam 's pregnancy ; Fischer was actually pregnant and her pregnancy was written into the series with Pam and Jim having their second baby . The episode received mixed reviews from critics . According to Nielsen Media Research , the episode received 5 @.@ 96 million viewers and received a 3 @.@ 0 rating / 7 % share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49 marking a slight drop in the ratings from the previous episode , " <unk> " . 
 Meanwhile , CEO Robert California ( James <unk> ) surprises Andy ( Ed Helms ) , Kevin ( Brian <unk> ) , and Darryl ( Craig Robinson ) when he asks to join their band after he finds them having a jam session in the warehouse . Soon thereafter , California 's friends , skilled musicians themselves , arrive to join in . Not having brought their own instruments , two of them take over Kevin 's drums and Darryl 's synthesizer , while Andy 's acoustic guitar is drowned out by the newcomer 's electric guitar . The three of them are thus relegated to playing percussion . Andy , Kevin and Darryl , with the help of warehouse worker <unk> , realize that they were ousted , and after a failed attempt to try getting their original band roles back , they instead <unk> jam outside by themselves . 
 The episode was written by consulting producer Allison Silverman , her first writing credit for the series after joining the writing staff in the eighth season . It was directed by Matt <unk> , one of the series ' <unk> and camera operators , his third directing credit for the series . The episode features a guest appearance from Lindsey Broad , and her character was described as " Pam ’ s competent and likable pal , " <unk> . She appeared in a recurring role in the eighth season . The episode also relates to Pam 's pregnancy . Jenna Fischer was actually pregnant and her pregnancy was written into the series with Pam and Jim having their second baby . The man who played Robert 's skilled drummer friend is Steve Moore , better known as " The Mad Drummer " for a viral video he was featured in . 
 In its original American broadcast , " Pam 's <unk> " was viewed by an estimated 5 @.@ 96 million viewers and received a 3 @.@ 0 rating / 7 % share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49 .

 " Pam 's <unk> " received generally mixed reviews from critics . HitFix writer Alan Sepinwall complimented the episode for staying true to the characters compared to the rest of the season , which he had criticized in an earlier review . He called the episode a " significant step up " albeit just " decent " in absolute terms . The A.V. Club reviewer Myles <unk> criticized the Andy – Kevin – Darryl subplot for its lack of continuity or any sort of <unk> . He was also critical of the Pam – Dwight plot for not staying true to the characters , and suggested that the writers needed to write the show as less of " a bland copy of itself " . He called it one of the <unk> half @-@ hours of the show and gave it a C − . <unk> White of IGN said that the episode needed a stronger A @-@ plot writing that the plots " felt like a meal made up of two <unk> side dishes " . She gave it a 7 out of 10 . Hanna Lawrence of <unk> praised the episode for being <unk> and for showing things that happen in real life . She also praised the Jim – Pam plot for showcasing the couple as not completely " perfect " . She called the band subplot " weak " . 
 WASP @-@ <unk> is a transiting planet in orbit around the young , active , and low @-@ mass star WASP @-@ 43 in the constellation <unk> . The planet is a Hot Jupiter with a mass twice that of Jupiter , and a radius equal to Jupiter 's . WASP @-@ <unk> was flagged as a candidate by the SuperWASP program before they conducted follow @-@ ups using instruments at La <unk> Observatory in Chile , which confirmed the planet 's existence and provided orbital and physical characteristics . The planet 's discovery was published on April 14 , 2011 . 
 At the time of its discovery , WASP @-@ <unk> had an orbital period of approximately 0 @.@ 8 days ( 19 @.@ 2 hours ) , the second shortest orbit ever detected , surpassed only by WASP @-@ <unk> . In addition , at the time of discovery , WASP @-@ <unk> was the most closely orbiting Hot Jupiter known , a phenomenon that can most likely be explained by its host star 's low mass . 
 WASP @-@ 43 was first flagged as host to a potential transiting event ( when a body crosses in front of and <unk> its host star ) by data collected by SuperWASP , a British organization working to discover transiting planets across the entirety of the sky . In particular , WASP @-@ 43 was observed first by the leg of WASP @-@ South at the South African Astronomical Observatory between January and May 2009 . 
 Later observation by both <unk> in the Northern and Southern <unk> led to the collection of 13 @,@ <unk> data points between January and May 2010 and to the use of the <unk> spectrograph at La <unk> Observatory in Chile . Fourteen measurements using the radial velocity method confirmed WASP @-@ <unk> as a planet , revealing its mass in the process . The use of La <unk> 's <unk> telescope helped the science team working on the planet to create a light curve of the planet 's transit in December 2010 . 
 In 2014 , secondary transit of the planet was reported . Full observation of phases of the planet was reported in the September of 2014 . 
 WASP @-@ 43 is a K @-@ type star in the <unk> constellation that is about 80 <unk> ( 261 light years ) away . The star has a mass of 0 @.@ 58 times that of the Sun , but is more diffuse with a radius of 0 @.@ 93 times that of the Sun . The star 's effective temperature is <unk> K , making the star cooler than the Sun , and is metal @-@ poor with regards to the Sun because it has a metallicity of [ Fe / H ] = − 0 @.@ 05 ( 89 % the amount of iron in the Sun ) . The star is young , and is estimated to be <unk> million years old ( as compared to the Sun 's 4 @.@ 6 billion years ) . Analysis of emission lines have indicated that WASP @-@ 43 is an active star . 
 WASP @-@ 43 has one detected planet in its orbit , WASP @-@ <unk> . The star has an apparent magnitude of 12 @.@ 4 , and thus is too faint to be seen with the unaided eye from Earth . 
 WASP @-@ <unk> , along with the planets WASP @-@ <unk> and WASP @-@ <unk> , conflicted with currently accepted models of <unk> movements derived from observations of the orbits of binary star systems . <unk> to the model with regard to planets were proposed to help the models conform to the orbital parameters of these planets . 
 In comparison , planet Mercury has an orbital period of 87 @.@ 97 days and lies at a mean distance of 0 @.@ <unk> AU from the Sun . 
 The flag of Poland consists of two horizontal stripes of equal width , the upper one white and the lower one red . The two colors are defined in the Polish constitution as the national colors . A variant of the flag with the national coat of arms in the middle of the white stripe is legally reserved for official use abroad and at sea . A similar flag with the addition of a swallow @-@ tail is used as the naval <unk> of Poland . 
 White and red were officially adopted as national colors in 1831 . They are of <unk> origin and <unk> from the <unk> ( colors ) of the coats of arms of the two constituent nations of the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth , i.e. the White Eagle of Poland and the <unk> of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania , a white knight riding a white horse , both on a red shield . Prior to that , Polish soldiers wore <unk> of various color combinations . The national flag was officially adopted in 1919 . Since 2004 , Polish Flag Day is celebrated on May 2 . 
 The flag is flown continuously on the buildings of the highest national authorities , such as the parliament and the presidential palace . Other institutions and many Polish people fly the national flag on national holidays and other special occasions of national significance . Current Polish law does not restrict the use of the national flag without the coat of arms as long as the flag is not <unk> . 
 <unk> <unk> of white and red being a relatively widespread design , there are several flags that are similar but unrelated to the Polish one . There are two national flags with the red stripe above the white one : those of Indonesia and Monaco . In Poland , many flags based on the national design also feature the national colors . 
 Legislation concerning the national symbols is far from perfect . The <unk> of Arms Act has been amended several times and refers extensively to executive <unk> , some of which have never been issued . Moreover , the Act contains errors , <unk> and inconsistencies which make the law confusing , open to various interpretations and often not followed in practice . 
 The state flag of the Republic of Poland is a rectangular piece of cloth in the colors of the Republic of Poland <unk> on a flagpole . 
 The state flag of the Republic of Poland is also the flag specified in paragraph 1 , with the coat of arms of the Republic of Poland placed in the middle of the white stripe . 
 The hoist to fly ratio for both flags is 5 : 8 . For the latter flag , the proportion between the <unk> of the coat of arms and the hoist is 2 : 5 . <unk> of both variations of the flag can be found in attachment no . 3 to the <unk> of Arms Act . 
 Polish law says that treating the national symbols , including the flag , " with <unk> and respect " is the " right and obligation " of every Polish citizen and all state organs , institutions and organizations . Public disrespect , destruction or intentional removal of the flag is considered a crime punishable by a fine , penal servitude or up to one year of imprisonment . Official statistics show that crimes against national symbols are rare : 43 such crimes in 2003 and 96 in 2004 were less than 0 @.@ 001 % of all crimes registered in Poland in those years . Other , unspecified violation of regulations on the Polish flag is an infraction , punishable by a fine or up to one month imprisonment . 
 According to the <unk> of Arms Act , everyone can use the Polish flag , especially during national and cultural events , as long as it is done in a respectful manner . This liberty in the use of national colors is a relative novelty . Until 2004 , Polish citizens were only allowed to fly the Polish flag on national holidays . The use of both variants was restricted , but only flying the flag with coat of arms was , from 1955 until 1985 , punishable by a fine or arrest for up to one year . After 1985 , unauthorized use of any national symbols was an infraction . A possible explanation to such harsh measures was the fact that the officially @-@ promoted holiday of May 1st was separated by only one day from the pre @-@ war ( and current ) national holiday of Poland , the anniversary of signing of the Constitution of May 3 , 1791 . While hoisting a flag on May 1 was acceptable , no later than the following day it must have been hidden . 
 This restriction and kind of state monopoly on the use of national symbols during the Communist regime made flying the Polish flag a symbol of resistance against the government . It became customary – and still is – for workers to hoist Polish flags on plant buildings when going on strike . This is why the Polish flag , as a symbol of patriotism and resistance against the Communist rule , is part of the <unk> trade union logo . 
 <unk> that are required by law to fly the national flag without coat of arms either on top or in front of their official buildings are : 
 the Council of Ministers ( cabinet ) and the President of the Council of Ministers ( Prime Minister ) ; 
 Additionally , the national flag without coat of arms is used as an <unk> for inland navigation . 
 While the ban on using the flag without coat of arms has been lifted , the use of the national flag with coat of arms is still legally restricted . This flag should be only flown : 
 on or in front of Polish embassies , <unk> and other representative offices and missions abroad , as well as by Polish ambassadors and <unk> on their residences and vehicles ; 
 In practice , however , this restriction is often ignored and the two flags – with and without coat of arms – are treated as interchangeable . The variant with the coat of arms is particularly often used by the <unk> , or Polish diaspora outside Poland , especially in the United States . 
 State and local government organs are legally required , and other institutions and organizations as well as all citizens are encouraged to fly the Polish flag on the following days : 
 Polish Flag Day ( formally : Flag of the Republic of Poland Day , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ) was first observed on May 2 , 2004 . It was established in order to educate the Polish people about the history and significance of national symbols . The date was chosen to coincide with the <unk> Day traditionally observed by the Polish diaspora outside Poland and the Polish Senate on May 2 . There was also a historical reason : under the Communist regime , May 2 was a day when national flags , <unk> for Labor Day on May 1 were being quickly removed before Polish Constitution Day ( May 3 ) , which was banned by the authorities . Since the re @-@ introduction of the Constitution Day in 1990 and establishment of the Polish Flag Day , the flag is flown continuously during the first three days of May . Unlike May Day and Constitution Day , the Flag Day is not a public holiday , although making a bridge , i.e. taking a day off on that day is common practice ( see <unk> in Poland ) . 
 August 15 – Polish Armed Forces Day ( mostly on military premises and at tombs of the Unknown Soldier ) 
 The flag is also popularly flown during important sporting events , such as the FIFA World Cup , if Polish athletes are participating ; and during an official visit of a particularly important person , especially a pope , in Poland . During a pope 's visit , the national flag is usually flown together with yellow and white Church flags , and white and blue Marian flags . It is uncommon to fly the national flag on personal occasions , such as <unk> or weddings . 
 According to polls , about one out of three Poles say they own a Polish flag , and about one out of four fly it on national holidays . Such public display of patriotism is much more common in western Poland , especially in Greater Poland , than in other parts of the country . 
 Flags in Poland are used according to a customary , rather than legal , flag protocol . Apart from the obligation to treat the flag with due respect , Polish law does not offer a detailed code of correct usage of the Polish flag . Some organizations and public institutions , such as the <unk> and <unk> Institute and the Supreme Chamber of Control have proposed written flag protocols for the Polish flag , based on custom , flag protocols of other countries such as India and the United States , and common sense . These guidelines , however , are not legally binding . 
 Traditionally , the national flag is reserved to serve either <unk> of <unk> purposes . A single specimen of the flag on or in front of a public office building indicates its official role . Multiple flags , on the other hand , are normally used to <unk> both public and private buildings to mark special occasions , such as national holidays . 
 In Polish <unk> , the <unk> of the charge has priority in relation to the <unk> of the field . In the case of Polish national colors , white , the color of the White Eagle , should always be placed in a more honorable position than red , the color of the field of the Polish coat of arms . In the most usual , horizontal alignment , this means that the white stripe is placed above the red one . If the alignment is vertical , the white stripe should be on the left from the <unk> 's point of view . If the flag is hung vertically above a street , the white stripe should be placed on the left when looking in the direction of increasing house numbers . If it <unk> a coffin , the white stripe should be placed over the heart . 
 The flag should be raised before 8 a.m. and lowered at sunset , and if flown at night , it should be illuminated . During a ceremonial raising of the flag , the national anthem is played so that the timing of the raising matches the duration of the anthem . <unk> pay respect by standing in a dignified manner ; additionally , men uncover their heads . Members of <unk> services stand at attention ; if their uniform includes headgear and they are not standing in an organized group , they also perform the two @-@ finger salute . Color guards dip their <unk> to the flag . ( See video ) 
 According to generally accepted standards of respect , the national flag should never be dipped to any person or thing . Care should be taken to prevent the flag from touching the ground , floor or water beneath it . It should be also secured from being torn off or falling to the ground and it should not be flown outdoors during a heavy rain , <unk> or very strong wind . The flag should never be flown dirty , torn or faded . When no longer in a fit condition to be used , it should be disposed of in a dignified manner , <unk> by cutting it in half so as to separate the colors and then , burning . 
 When displayed with other flags , the Polish flag should be raised first and lowered last . Each flag must be flown from a separate pole of the same height , but the flag of Poland should be always placed in the most honorable position . It means that if the total number of flags is even , the Polish flag should be placed to its right of the other flags . If the total number of flags is odd , it should be placed in the middle . Alternatively , two Polish flags may be placed , one at each end of the row of flags . The order of precedence for flags is as follows : 
 The President of the Republic may announce a period of national mourning . During that time Polish flags are flown at half @-@ staff . If a flag is flown from a wooden pole rather than a staff or mast , a black ribbon is attached to the pole as a sign of mourning or a black flag is flown to its left from the national flag . 
 In the times of the Polish @-@ Lithuanian Commonwealth ( 1569 – 1795 ) , a banner of the Commonwealth was also used , combining the <unk> symbols of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania . The Commonwealth banner was initially plain white <unk> with the arms of the Commonwealth which consisted of the <unk> charges of Poland ( White Eagle ) and Lithuania ( <unk> ) . Since both Polish and Lithuanian coats of arms consisted of white ( <unk> ) charges in a red ( <unk> ) field , these two colors started to be used for the entire banner . During the 17th century , the banner was usually divided into two , three or four horizontal , often swallow @-@ tailed , stripes of red and white . 
 In the 18th and 19th centuries , European nations used <unk> , or knots of colored ribbons pinned to the hat , to denote the nationality of their military . In Poland , until 1831 , there was no consensus as to what the colors of the national <unk> should be . Polish soldiers wore white , white @-@ and @-@ red , blue @-@ and @-@ red or blue @-@ white @-@ red <unk> . 
 During the uprising , the Sejm realized the need for unified national insignia that could be used by the Polish military . On February 7 , 1831 it adopted white and red , the <unk> ( colors ) of the Polish and Lithuanian coats of arms , as the national <unk> of Poland . The white @-@ and @-@ red <unk> was <unk> worn by Polish soldiers in the November Uprising , as well as by participants of the Kraków Uprising of 1846 , Polish freedom fighters in the Grand Duchy of <unk> and the Austrian Empire during the Spring of Nations of 1848 , and Polish insurgents during the January Uprising of 1863 – 1864 . White and red colors were also used by civilians to show their protest against the Russian rule , as well as by people in France , Britain , Germany , Belgium and other countries as a sign of their sympathy with the Polish cause . The Sejm 's decision was not , however , immediately accepted by all . Left @-@ wing politicians of the time , such as Joachim <unk> , continued to regard the revolutionary blue , white and red as true national colors . <unk> standards were used by some Polish guerrilla units during the January Uprising . 
 White @-@ and @-@ red flags were first <unk> during a patriotic demonstration on May 3 , 1916 in Warsaw . The organizing committee advised participants about the correct alignment of the colors , that is with the white stripe above the red one . Still , many demonstrators brought flags with the red stripe on top . On August 1 , 1919 , almost a year after Poland regained independence in November 1918 , the Sejm officially introduced a white @-@ and @-@ red bicolor as the Polish national flag . In order to avoid confusion with the white @-@ and @-@ red maritime signal flag used internationally by harbor pilots and <unk> , the same act of Sejm introduced a variant of the flag with the coat of arms in the white stripe for use as a civil <unk> and by Polish diplomats and <unk> abroad . 
 Apart from changes in the legal specifications of the shades of the national colors ( see the section below ) , the basic design of the Polish flag , including the 5 : 8 ratio , has remained unchanged to this day . The flag with coat of arms was only modified to adjust to the changes in the coat of arms itself . Major modifications included a change in the <unk> of the eagle from <unk> to Baroque in 1927 and the removal of the crown from the eagle 's head during the Communist rule from 1944 to 1990 . 
 Polish flags were also used by anti @-@ government demonstrators under the Communist rule . During the bloody riots of 1956 in <unk> and 1970 in <unk> , protesters carried flags that were blood @-@ stained on the white stripe . 
 The flag of the Grand Duchy of <unk> , a Polish @-@ populated autonomous province of the Kingdom of Prussia created in 1815 , was a red @-@ and @-@ white horizontal bicolor . Its colors were taken from the <unk> 's coat of arms which consisted of the Prussian Black Eagle with an <unk> of the Polish White Eagle . With Germany 's increasingly anti @-@ Polish policy and a rising identification of white and red as Polish national colors , the red @-@ and @-@ white flag of <unk> was replaced in 1886 with a white @-@ black @-@ white horizontal <unk> . No other part of Poland during the time of <unk> used a flag that would incorporate Polish national colors . 
 Today , many flags used in Poland are based on the design of the national flag . This applies especially to flags defined by Polish law and used by the Polish military and other <unk> services , such as the naval <unk> – a swallow @-@ tailed horizontal bicolor of white and red defaced with the arms of Poland in the white stripe . Flags of some administrative subdivisions also resemble the national flag . Examples include the former flag of the Lower <unk> <unk> – a horizontal bicolor of white and red defaced with the arms of the <unk> – or the flag of the Lesser Poland <unk> – a horizontal <unk> of white , yellow and red with the yellow stripe half as wide as any of the other two . 
 Due to the horizontal bicolor being a relatively simple and widespread flag design , and white and red being the most popular colors used on flags , there are many flags worldwide that are similar or near identical to the flag of Poland despite being unrelated to it . For example , the historical flag of Bohemia , the major historical region of Poland 's southern neighbor , the Czech Republic , consists of two horizontal stripes , white on top and red on bottom . Similarly to the flag of Poland , it is of <unk> origin , the coat of arms of Bohemia being <unk> , a lion rampant , queue <unk> <unk> , crowned , <unk> and armed Or , that is a silver double @-@ tailed lion in a red field . The white @-@ and @-@ red Bohemian flag came into use when Bohemia was a province of Austria @-@ Hungary and , after the end of the First World War in 1918 , it was shortly used as a flag of the newly formed <unk> @-@ <unk> Republic . In 1920 , in order to avoid confusion with the Polish flag , a blue triangle was added to create a flag used by <unk> until its dissolution in 1993 and currently used as the flag of the Czech Republic . 
 Other examples of flags that could be confused with the Polish one include the civil flags of the following regions : <unk> , Spain ; <unk> , Slovenia ; <unk> , Germany ; Upper Austria and <unk> , Austria ; as well the city of Honda , Colombia . Furthermore , the Dutch city of <unk> used a similar design between 1938 @-@ 1994 but <unk> its old flag to avoid confusion . There are currently two independent states – Indonesia and Monaco – whose national flags are horizontal <unk> of red and white , reversing the Polish flag . The Monaco and Indonesia flags differ in proportions and shades of the colors ( see Flag of Indonesia and Flag of Monaco ) . 
 The following cladogram generated by Archibald and colleagues show the possible phylogenetic position of <unk> among some ants of the subfamily <unk> ; it is possible that <unk> may be the ancestor of <unk> . 
 Like all Hawaiian volcanoes , <unk> was created as the Pacific <unk> plate moved over the Hawaiian <unk> in the Earth 's underlying mantle . The Hawaii island volcanoes are the most recent evidence of this process that , over 70 million years , has created the 6 @,@ 000 km ( 3 @,@ 700 mi ) <unk> Hawaiian – Emperor <unk> chain . The prevailing , though not completely settled , view is that the <unk> has been largely stationary within the planet 's mantle for much , if not all of the Cenozoic Era . However , while the Hawaiian mantle plume is well @-@ understood and extensively studied , the nature of <unk> themselves remains fairly <unk> . 
 Following the pattern of Hawaiian volcano formation , <unk> started as a submarine volcano , gradually building itself up through underwater eruptions of alkali basalt <unk> before emerging from the sea with a series of explosive eruptions about 50 @,@ 000 to 100 @,@ 000 years ago . Since then , the volcano 's activity has likely been as it is now , a continual stream of <unk> and explosive eruptions of roughly the same pattern as its activity in the last 200 or 300 years . 
 At most 600 @,@ 000 years old , <unk> is still quite young for a Hawaiian volcano ; the oldest volcano on the island , the northwestern <unk> , experienced almost 900 @,@ 000 years of activity before going extinct . The volcano 's foreseeable future activity will likely be much like it has been for the past 50 @,@ 000 to 100 @,@ 000 years ; Hawaiian and explosive activity will continue to <unk> <unk> 's summit , build up its rift zones , and fill and <unk> its summit <unk> . 
 All historical eruptions at <unk> have occurred at one of three places : its summit <unk> , its eastern rift zone , or its southwestern rift zone . Half of <unk> 's historical eruptions have occurred at or near <unk> 's summit <unk> . <unk> there was nearly continuous for much of the 19th century , capped by a massive explosive eruption in 1924 before <unk> out by 1934 . Recent activity has mostly shifted to <unk> 's eastern rift zone , the site of 24 historical eruptions , located mostly on its upper section ; by contrast , the volcano 's southwestern rift zone has been relatively quiet , and has only been the site of five events to date . 
 Geologists have dated and documented dozens of major eruptions over the volcano 's long history , bridging the long gap between <unk> 's oldest known rock and only extremely recent written records and historical observation . Historical <unk> flows from the volcano are generally recovered by scientists in one of three ways . The oldest flows , dating back 275 @,@ 000 to 225 @,@ 000 years , have been recovered from <unk> 's submerged southern slope by ship @-@ towed <unk> operated vehicles . These <unk> exhibit forms characteristic of early , submerged <unk> @-@ stage <unk> episodes , from when the volcano was still a rising <unk> that had not yet breached the ocean surface , and their surface exposure is unusual , as in most other volcanoes such <unk> would have since been buried by more recent flows . 
 The earliest reliable written records of historical activity date back to about 1820 , and the first well @-@ documented eruption occurred in 1823 , when the volcano was first put under observation ; although Native Hawaiians are thought to have first settled on the island around 1 @,@ 500 years ago , oral records <unk> European arrival on the island are few and difficult to interpret . One pre @-@ contact eruption in particular , a <unk> event in 1790 , was responsible for the death of a party of warriors , part of the army of <unk> <unk> , the last island chief to resist Kamehameha I 's rule ; their death is evidenced by a set of <unk> preserved within the Hawaii <unk> National Park which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places . <unk> has been the site of 61 separate eruptions since 1823 , easily making it one of the most active volcanoes on Earth . 
 During its observed history , the volume of <unk> erupted by <unk> has varied widely . In 1823 <unk> 's summit <unk> was far deeper than it is today , but was in the process of filling up under nearly continuous summit eruption , with 3 km3 ( 1 cu mi ) of <unk> erupted there alone by 1840 . The period between 1840 and 1920 saw approximately half that in <unk> volume , and in the thirty years between then and about 1950 , the volcano was unusually quiet and exhibited very little activity ; <unk> 's <unk> volume has increased steadily since then , with present activity comparable to that of the early 1800s . 
 The length and origin these eruptions has also varied . Events last anywhere between days and years , and occur at a number of different sites . Half of all eruptions occur at or near <unk> 's summit <unk> . <unk> there was nearly continuous for much of the 19th century , and after a <unk> between 1894 and 1907 , continued onwards until 1924 . There have been five historical eruptions at the volcano 's relatively southwestern rift zone , and 24 along its more active eastern rift zone , mostly along its upper section . 
 The volcano 's observed history has mostly been one of <unk> eruptions ; however , this is a relatively recent occurrence . Prior to the arrival of the first Europeans on the island , <unk> was the site of regular explosive activity , evidenced then by tribal <unk> referencing the volcano 's <unk> nature , and today by geological records of an explosively active mode of past activity . Although explosive activity still occurs at the volcano , it is not as intense as it once was , and the volcano would become much more dangerous to the general public if it returned to its old phase of activity once more . 
 <unk> erupted in 1823 and 1832 , but the first major eruption since the 1790 event occurred in 1840 , when its eastern rift zone became the site a large , <unk> Hawaiian eruption over 35 km ( 22 mi ) of its length , unusually long even for a rift eruption . The eruption lasted for 26 days and produced an estimated 205 to 265 million cubic meters of <unk> ; the light created by the event was so intense that one could reportedly read a newspaper in Hilo at night , 30 km ( 19 mi ) away . 
 Following the event , <unk> events yearly and nearly continuous , a state of activity that remains today . 1967 – 1968 saw a particularly large , 80 @-@ million @-@ cubic @-@ meter , 251 @-@ day event from <unk> <unk> . This event was superseded the very next year by the marathon <unk> <unk> eruption , a large <unk> eruption which lasted from May 24 , 1969 to July 24 , 1974 and added 230 acres ( 93 ha ) of new land to the island . After <unk> activity had died down , there was a magnitude 7 @.@ 2 earthquake that caused a partial summit collapse , after which activity did not resume at <unk> until 1977 . 
 In December 2014 , the June 27 flow from the ongoing eruption threatened to enter the town of <unk> , and to cut Highway 130 , the only route into and out of Lower <unk> . As a result , work was begun to reopen Chain of <unk> Road , initially as a one @-@ lane <unk> surface , and to make Railroad Avenue and Government Beach Road usable as emergency routes . However the flow stopped just short of entering <unk> , and by March 2015 the threat to the town was much reduced . 
 Because of its position more than 2 @,@ 000 miles from the nearest continental <unk> , the island of Hawaiʻi is one of the most geographically isolated <unk> on Earth ; this in turn has strongly influenced its ecology . The majority of the species present on the island are endemic to it and can be found nowhere else on Earth , the result of an isolated evolutionary <unk> sheltered from external <unk> influence ; this makes its ecosystem vulnerable both to invasive species and human development , and an estimated third of the island 's natural flora and fauna has already gone extinct . 
 <unk> 's bulk affects local climate conditions through the influence of trade winds coming predominately from the northeast , which , when squeezed upwards by the volcano 's height , results in a moister windward side and a comparatively arid <unk> flank . The volcano 's ecology is further complicated by height , though not nearly as much as with its other , far taller neighbors , and by the local distribution of volcanic products , which make for varied soil conditions . The northern part of <unk> is mostly below 1 @,@ 000 m ( 3 @,@ 281 ft ) and receives more than 75 in ( 191 cm ) mean annual rainfall , and can mostly be classified as a lowland wet community ; further south , the volcano has squeezed out much of the precipitation and receives less than 50 in ( 127 cm ) mean annual rainfall , and is considered mostly a lowland dry environment . 
 Some of the area alongside <unk> 's southwestern rift zone takes the form of the unusual <unk> Desert . Although not a " true " desert ( rainfall there exceeds the maximum 1 @,@ 000 mm ( 39 in ) a year ) , precipitation mixing with drifting volcanic sulfur dioxide forms acid rain with a <unk> as low as 3 @.@ 4 , greatly hampering regional plant growth . The deposited <unk> <unk> make the local soil very <unk> . Plant life in the region is practically <unk> . 
 The first Ancient Hawaiians to arrive on Hawaii island lived along the shores , where food and water were plentiful . <unk> birds that had previously known no predators became a staple food source . Early settlements had a major impact on the local ecosystem , and caused many <unk> , particularly amongst bird species , as well as introducing foreign plants and animals and increasing erosion rates . The prevailing lowland forest ecosystem was transformed from forest to grassland ; some of this change was caused by the use of fire , but the main reason appears to have been the introduction of the Polynesian rat ( <unk> <unk> ) . 
 This early era was followed by peace and cultural expansion between the 12th and late 18th century . Land was divided into regions designed for both the immediate needs of the populace and the long @-@ term welfare of the environment . These <unk> generally took the form of long strips of land oriented from the mountain <unk> to the coast . 
 The first foreigner to arrive at Hawaii was James Cook in 1778 . The first non @-@ native to observe <unk> in detail was William Ellis , an English missionary who in 1823 spent more than two weeks <unk> across the volcano . He <unk> the first written account of the volcano and observed many of its features , establishing the premise for future <unk> of the volcano . 
 One of the earliest and most important <unk> of <unk> was James Dwight Dana , who , staying with the missionary Titus <unk> , studied the island 's volcanoes in detail for decades first @-@ hand . Dana visited <unk> 's summit and described it in detail in 1840 . After publishing a summary paper in 1852 , he directed a detailed geological study of the island in 1880 and 1881 but did not consider <unk> a separate volcano , instead referring to it as a flank vent of <unk> <unk> ; it was not until another geologist , C. E. <unk> , had elaborated on Dana 's research during an 1884 expedition that <unk> came to be generally accepted as a separate entity . 
 The gray wolf or grey wolf ( Canis lupus ) , also known as the timber wolf or western wolf , is a <unk> native to the wilderness and remote areas of Eurasia and North America . It is the largest extant member of its family , with males averaging 43 – 45 kg ( 95 – 99 lb ) , and females 36 – 38 @.@ 5 kg ( 79 – 85 lb ) . Like the red wolf , it is distinguished from other Canis species by its larger size and less pointed features , particularly on the ears and muzzle . Its winter fur is long and bushy , and predominantly a mottled gray in color , although nearly pure white , red , or brown to black also occur . As of 2005 , 37 subspecies of C. lupus are recognised by <unk> . 
 The gray wolf is the second most specialised member of the genus Canis , after the Ethiopian wolf , as demonstrated by its morphological adaptations to hunting large prey , its more gregarious nature , and its highly advanced expressive behavior . It is nonetheless closely related enough to smaller Canis species , such as the eastern wolf , coyote , and golden <unk> to produce fertile hybrids . It is the only species of Canis to have a range encompassing both the Old and New Worlds , and originated in Eurasia during the Pleistocene , <unk> North America on at least three separate occasions during the <unk> . It is a social animal , travelling in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair , accompanied by the pair 's adult offspring . The gray wolf is typically an apex predator throughout its range , with only humans and tigers posing a serious threat to it . It feeds primarily on large ungulates , though it also eats smaller animals , livestock , <unk> , and garbage . 
 The gray wolf is one of the world 's best known and well researched animals , with probably more books written about it than any other wildlife species . It has a long history of association with humans , having been despised and hunted in most pastoral communities because of its attacks on livestock , while <unk> being respected in some agrarian and hunter @-@ gatherer societies . Although the fear of wolves is pervasive in many human societies , the majority of recorded attacks on people have been attributed to animals suffering from <unk> . Non @-@ <unk> wolves have attacked and killed people , mainly children , but this is rare , as wolves are relatively few , live away from people , and have developed a fear of humans from hunters and shepherds . 
 The English ' wolf ' stems from the Old English <unk> , which is itself thought to be derived from the Proto @-@ <unk> * <unk> . The Latin lupus is a Sabine <unk> . Both <unk> from the Proto @-@ Indo @-@ European root * <unk> / * <unk> . 
 Canis lupus was recorded by Carl Linnaeus in his publication Systema <unk> in 1758 . The Latin classification translates into English as " dog wolf " . The subspecies of Canis lupus are listed in <unk> Species of the World . The nominate subspecies is the Eurasian wolf ( Canis lupus lupus ) , also known as the common wolf . As of 2005 37 subspecies of C. lupus are recognised by <unk> , however the classification of several as either species or subspecies has recently been challenged . 
 The evolution of the wolf occurred over a geologic time scale of 800 thousand years , transforming the first Middle Pleistocene wolf specimen that is recognized as being <unk> similar to Canis lupus into today 's dog , <unk> and gray wolf . Ecological factors including habitat type , climate , prey <unk> and predatory competition will greatly influence the wolf 's genetic population structure and <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> . Wolves went through a population bottleneck 20 @,@ 000 years before present ( <unk> ) , which indicates that many wolf populations had gone extinct at a time that coincided with the Last <unk> Maximum and the expansion of modern humans worldwide with their technology for capturing large game . The domestic dog is the most widely abundant large <unk> and a descendant from one of those now @-@ extinct wolf populations . Today , the wolf is represented by the many extant subspecies of Canis lupus , which includes the dog and <unk> . 
 <unk> , C. lupus taxonomy has been subject to numerous revisions , particularly in North America . As of 2005 , 37 subspecies of C. lupus are recognised by <unk> . Its list includes the domestic dog , <unk> , eastern wolf and red wolf , but lists C. <unk> <unk> and C. <unk> <unk> as synonyms of C. <unk> lupus . 
 <unk> and gray wolves do not voluntarily <unk> in the wild , though they can produce fertile wolf @-@ dog offspring . In North America , black colored wolves acquired their coloration from wolf @-@ dog <unk> , which occurred 10 @,@ 000 – 15 @,@ 000 years ago . Like pure wolves , hybrids breed once annually , though their mating season occurs three months earlier , with <unk> mostly being born in the winter period , thus <unk> their chances of survival . However , one genetic study undertaken in the <unk> Mountains showed that as many as 10 % of dogs in the area , including livestock guardian dogs , are first generation hybrids . The captive breeding of wolf @-@ dog hybrids has <unk> in the USA , with 300 @,@ 000 such animals being present there . 
 Compared to its closest wild cousins ( the coyote and golden <unk> ) , the gray wolf is larger and heavier , with a broader snout , shorter ears , a shorter torso and longer tail . It is a slender , powerfully built animal with a large , deeply descending <unk> , a sloping back and a heavily muscled neck . The wolf 's legs are moderately longer than those of other <unk> , which enables the animal to move swiftly , and allows it to overcome the deep snow that covers most of its geographical range . Females tend to have narrower <unk> and <unk> , thinner necks , slightly shorter legs and less massive shoulders than males . 
 The gray wolf usually carries its head at the same level as the back , raising it only when alert . It usually travels at a <unk> pace , placing its paws one directly in front of the other . This gait can be maintained for hours at a rate of 8 – 9 km / h , and allows the wolf to cover great distances . On bare paths , a wolf can quickly achieve speeds of 50 – 60 km / h . The gray wolf has a running gait of 55 to 70 km / h , can leap 5 metres horizontally in a single bound , and can maintain rapid pursuit for at least 20 minutes . 
 The gray wolf is the largest extant member of the <unk> , excepting certain large breeds of domestic dog . Gray wolf weight and size can vary greatly worldwide , tending to increase proportionally with latitude as predicted by Bergmann 's Rule , with the large wolves of Alaska and Canada sometimes weighing 3 – 6 times more than their Middle Eastern and South Asian cousins . On average , adult wolves measure 105 – 160 cm ( 41 – 63 in ) in length and 80 – 85 cm ( 32 – 34 in ) in shoulder height . The tail measures 29 – 50 cm ( 11 – 20 in ) in length . The ears are 90 – 110 millimetres ( 3 @.@ 5 – 4 @.@ 3 in ) in height , and the hind feet are 220 – 250 millimetres ( 8 @.@ 7 – 9 @.@ 8 in ) . The skull averages 9 – 11 inches in length , and 5 – 6 inches wide . The mean body mass of the extant gray wolf is 40 kg ( 88 lb ) , with the smallest specimen recorded at 12 kg ( 26 lb ) and the largest at 80 kg ( 176 lb ) . Gray wolf weight varies geographically ; on average , European wolves may weigh 38 @.@ 5 kilograms ( 85 lb ) , North American wolves 36 kilograms ( 79 lb ) and Indian and Arabian wolves 25 kilograms ( 55 lb ) . Females in any given wolf population typically weigh 5 – 10 <unk> less than males . Wolves weighing over 54 kg ( 120 <unk> ) are uncommon , though exceptionally large individuals have been recorded in Alaska , Canada , and the forests of western Russia . The heaviest recorded gray wolf in North America was killed on 70 Mile River in east @-@ central Alaska on July 12 , 1939 and weighed 79 @.@ 4 kilograms ( 175 lb ) . 
 Wolves are highly territorial animals , and generally establish territories far larger than they require to survive in order to <unk> a steady supply of prey . Territory size depends largely on the amount of prey available and the age of the pack 's <unk> , tending to increase in size in areas with low prey populations or when the <unk> reach the age of 6 months , thus having the same nutritional needs as adults . Wolf packs travel constantly in search of prey , covering roughly 9 % of their territory per day ( average 25 km / d or 15 mi / d ) . The core of their territory is on average 35 km2 ( 14 sq mi ) , in which they spend 50 % of their time . Prey density tends to be much higher in the territory 's surrounding areas , though wolves tend to avoid hunting in the fringes of their range unless desperate , because of the possibility of fatal encounters with neighboring packs . The smallest territory on record was held by a pack of six wolves in northeastern Minnesota , which occupied an estimated 33 km2 ( 13 sq mi ) , while the largest was held by an <unk> pack of ten wolves encompassing a 6 @,@ 272 km2 ( 2 @,@ 422 sq mi ) area . Wolf packs are typically settled , and usually only leave their accustomed ranges during severe food shortages . 
 Wolves defend their territories from other packs through a combination of scent marking , direct attacks and <unk> ( see Communication ) . <unk> marking is used for territorial advertisement , and involves <unk> , defecation and ground scratching . <unk> marks are generally left every 240 metres throughout the territory on regular <unk> and junctions . Such markers can last for 2 – 3 weeks , and are typically placed near rocks , boulders , trees or the skeletons of large animals . Territorial fights are among the principal causes of wolf mortality , with one study concluding that 14 – 65 % of wolf deaths in Minnesota and the <unk> National Park and Preserve were due to predation by other wolves . 
 The gray wolf is generally monogamous , with mated pairs usually remaining together for life , unless one of the pair dies . Upon the death of one mated wolf , pairs are quickly re @-@ established . Since males often predominate in any given wolf population , <unk> females are a rarity . If a <unk> male gray wolf is unable to establish a territory or find a mate , he mates with the daughters of already established breeding pairs from other packs . Such gray wolves are termed " <unk> wolves " and , unlike males from established packs , they do not form pair bonds with the females they mate with . Some gray wolf packs may have multiple breeding females this way , as is the case in Yellowstone National Park . Gray wolves also practice <unk> care , in which a wolf pair may adopt the <unk> or <unk> of another . This might take place if the original parents die or are for some reason separated from them . In addition to heterosexual behavior , homosexual behavior has been observed in gray wolves . Male gray wolves often mount each other when the highest ranking female in the pack comes into heat . 
 The age of first breeding in gray wolves depends largely on environmental factors : when food is plentiful , or when wolf populations are heavily managed , wolves can rear <unk> at younger ages in order to better exploit abundant resources . This is further demonstrated by the fact that captive wolves have been known to breed as soon as they reach 9 – 10 months , while the youngest recorded breeding wolves in the wild were 2 years old . Females are capable of producing <unk> every year , with one litter annually being the average . Unlike the coyote , the gray wolf never reaches reproductive <unk> . <unk> typically occurs in late winter , with older , <unk> females entering <unk> 2 – 3 weeks earlier than younger females . During pregnancy , female wolves remain in a den located away from the peripheral zone of their territories , where violent encounters with other packs are more likely . Old females usually <unk> in the den of their previous litter , while younger females typically den near their birthplace . The gestation period lasts 62 – 75 days , with <unk> usually being born in the summer period . 
 Although social animals , single wolves or mated pairs typically have higher success rates in hunting than do large packs , with single wolves having occasionally been observed to kill large prey such as moose , bison and <unk> unaided . The gray wolf 's sense of smell is relatively weakly developed when compared to that of some hunting dog breeds , being able to detect <unk> <unk> no farther than 2 – 3 km . Because of this , it rarely manages to capture hidden hares or birds , though it can easily follow fresh tracks . Its auditory perception is acute enough to be able to hear up to a frequency of 26 kHz , which is sufficient to register the fall of leaves in the autumn period . A gray wolf hunt can be divided into five stages : 
 <unk> prey : The wolves travel in search of prey through their power of scent , chance encounter , and tracking . Wolves typically locate their prey by scent , though they must usually be directly <unk> of it . When a breeze carrying the prey 's scent is located , the wolves stand alert , and point their eyes , ears and nose towards their target . In open areas , wolves may <unk> the hunt with group ceremonies involving standing nose @-@ to @-@ nose and <unk> their tails . Once concluded , the wolves head towards their prey . 
 The stalk : The wolves attempt to conceal themselves as they approach . As the gap between the wolves and their prey closes , the wolves <unk> their pace , <unk> their tails , and peer <unk> , getting as close to their quarry as possible without making it flee . 
 The encounter : Once the prey <unk> the wolves , it can either approach the wolves , stand its ground , or flee . Large prey , such as moose , elk , and <unk> , usually stand their ground . Should this occur , the wolves hold back , as they require the stimulus of a running animal to proceed with an attack . If the targeted animal stands its ground , the wolves either ignore it , or try to <unk> it into running . 
 The rush : If the prey attempts to flee , the wolves immediately pursue it . This is the most critical stage of the hunt , as wolves may never catch up with prey running at top speed . If their prey is travelling in a group , the wolves either attempt to break up the herd , or isolate one or two animals from it . 
 The chase : A continuation of the rush , the wolves attempt to catch up with their prey and kill it . When chasing small prey , wolves attempt to catch up with their prey as soon as possible , while with larger animals , the chase is prolonged , in order to wear the selected prey out . Wolves usually give up chases after 1 – 2 km ( 0 @.@ 62 – 1 @.@ 3 mi ) , though one wolf was recorded to chase a deer for 21 km ( 13 mi ) . Both Russian and North American wolves have been observed to drive prey onto <unk> ice , <unk> , <unk> , slopes and steep banks to slow them down . 
 Similar to humans , gray wolves have facial color patterns in which the gaze direction can be easily identified , although this is often not the case in other <unk> species . In 2014 , a study compared the facial color pattern across 25 <unk> species . The results suggested that that the facial color pattern of <unk> species is related to their gaze communication , and that especially gray wolves use the gaze signal in <unk> communication . 
 Wolves supplement their diet with fruit and vegetable matter . They willingly eat the berries of mountain ash , <unk> of the valley , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . Other fruits include <unk> , apples and <unk> . They readily visit <unk> fields during the summer months . A well @-@ fed wolf stores fat under the skin , around the heart , intestines , <unk> , and bone marrow , particularly during the autumn and winter . <unk> only takes a few hours , thus wolves can feed several times in one day , making quick use of large quantities of meat . 
 Brown bears typically dominate wolf packs in disputes over carcasses , while wolf packs mostly prevail against bears when defending their den sites . Both species kill each other 's young . Wolves eat the brown bears they kill , while brown bears seem to only eat young wolves . Wolf interactions with American black bears are much rarer than with brown bears , because of differences in habitat preferences . The majority of black bear encounters with wolves occur in the species ' northern range , with no interactions being recorded in Mexico . Wolves have been recorded on numerous occasions to actively seek out black bears in their <unk> and kill them without eating them . Unlike brown bears , black bears frequently lose against wolves in disputes over kills . While encounters with brown and black bears appear to be common , polar bears are rarely encountered by wolves , though there are two records of wolf packs killing polar bear cubs . Wolves also kill the cubs of Asian black bears . 
 Wolves may encounter striped <unk> in Israel , Central Asia and India , usually in disputes over carcasses . <unk> <unk> feed extensively on wolf @-@ killed carcasses in areas where the two species interact . One @-@ to @-@ one , <unk> dominate wolves , but wolf packs can drive off single or outnumbered <unk> . However , there was a case of a female striped <unk> dominating 12 Arabian wolves . Two cases are known however from southern Israel , where wolves and striped <unk> associated closely with each other in an apparently <unk> way . 
 Large wolf populations limit the numbers of small to medium @-@ sized <unk> . Wolves encounter cougars along portions of the Rocky Mountains and adjacent mountain ranges . Wolves and cougars typically avoid encountering each other by hunting on different elevations . In winter , however , when snow <unk> forces their prey into valleys , interactions between the two species become more likely . Wolves in packs usually dominate cougars and can steal kills . They have been reported killing mothers and their kittens . Wolves hunt steppe cats , and may <unk> from snow leopard kills . Wolves may also reduce Eurasian <unk> populations . Wolves may kill <unk> by running them down , or killing them before they can escape into trees . Similar reports of encounters between wolves and <unk> have been documented . 
 <unk> of wolf kills are sometimes <unk> by <unk> . Wolverines usually wait until the wolves are done feeding , but have been known to drive away wolves from kills . However , there have been confirmed reports of wolf packs killing <unk> . 
 Other than humans , tigers appear to be the only serious predators of wolves . Wolf and tiger interactions are well documented in <unk> @-@ <unk> , where tigers depress wolf numbers , either to the point of localized extinction or to such low numbers as to make them a <unk> insignificant component of the ecosystem . Wolves appear capable of escaping competitive exclusion from tigers only when human persecution decreases tiger numbers . <unk> cases of tigers killing wolves are rare and attacks appear to be competitive rather than predatory in nature , with at least four proven records of tigers killing wolves without consuming them . 
 The gray wolf was once one of the world 's most widely distributed mammals , living throughout the northern hemisphere north of 15 ° N latitude in North America and 12 ° N in India . However , deliberate human persecution has reduced the species ' range to about one third , because of livestock predation and fear over attacks on humans . The species is now extinct in much of Western Europe , in Mexico and much of the United States . In modern times , the gray wolf occurs mostly in wilderness and remote areas , particularly in Canada , Alaska and northern USA , Europe , and Asia from about 75 ° N to 12 ° N. Wolf population declines have been arrested since the 1970s , and have fostered <unk> and reintroduction in parts of its former range , due to legal protection , changes in land @-@ use and rural human population shifts to cities . Competition with humans for livestock and game species , concerns over the danger posed by wolves to people , and habitat fragmentation pose a continued threat to the species . Despite these threats , because of the gray wolf 's relatively widespread range and stable population , it is classified as least concern by the IUCN . 
 Although wolf @-@ dog <unk> in Europe has raised concern among conservation groups fearing for the gray wolf 's purity , genetic tests show that <unk> of dog genes into European gray wolf populations does not pose a significant threat . Also , as wolf and dog mating seasons do not fully coincide , the likelihood of wild wolves and dogs mating and producing surviving offspring is small . 
 The <unk> of Northern Europe 's wolves first became an organized effort during the Middle Ages , and continued until the late 1800s . In England , wolf persecution was enforced by legislation , and the last wolf was killed in the early sixteenth century during the reign of Henry VII . Wolves lasted longer in Scotland , where they sheltered in vast tracts of forest , which were subsequently burned down . Wolves managed to survive in the forests of <unk> and Sutherland until 1684 . The <unk> of wolves in Ireland followed a similar course , with the last wolf believed to have been killed in 1786 . A wolf <unk> was introduced in Sweden in 1647 , after the <unk> of moose and reindeer forced wolves to feed on livestock . The Sami extirpated wolves in northern Sweden in organized drives . By 1960 , few wolves remained in Sweden , because of the use of <unk> in hunting them , with the last specimen being killed in 1966 . The gray wolf was <unk> in Denmark in 1772 and Norway 's last wolf was killed in 1973 . The species was decimated in 20th century Finland , despite regular <unk> from Russia . The gray wolf was only present in the eastern and northern parts of Finland by 1900 , though its numbers increased after World War II . 
 In Southern Europe , wolf <unk> was not as complete as in Northern Europe , because of greater cultural tolerance of the species . Wolf populations only began declining in the Iberian Peninsula in the early 19th @-@ century , and was reduced by a half of its original size by 1900 . Wolf <unk> were regularly paid in Italy as late as 1950 . Wolves were <unk> in the <unk> by 1800 , and numbered only 100 by 1973 , inhabiting only 3 – 5 % of their former Italian range . 
 The recovery of European wolf populations began after the 1950s , when traditional pastoral and rural economies declined and thus removed the need to heavily <unk> wolves . By the 1980s , small and isolated wolf populations expanded in the wake of decreased human density in rural areas and the recovery of wild prey populations . 
 The gray wolf has been fully protected in Italy since 1976 , and now holds a population of over 1 @,@ 269 @-@ 1 @,@ 800 . Italian wolves entered France 's <unk> National Park in 1993 , and at least fifty wolves were discovered in the western <unk> in 2000 . By 2013 the 250 wolves in the Western <unk> imposed a significant burden on traditional sheep and goat <unk> with a loss of over 5 @,@ 000 animals in 2012 . There are approximately 2 @,@ 000 wolves inhabiting the Iberian Peninsula , of which 150 reside in northeastern Portugal . In Spain , the species occurs in <unk> , Leon , and <unk> . Although hundreds of Iberian wolves are illegally killed annually , the population has expanded south across the river <unk> and east to the <unk> and Pyrenees Mountains . 
 In 1978 , wolves began <unk> central Sweden after a twelve @-@ year absence , and have since expanded into southern Norway . As of 2005 , the total number of Swedish and Norwegian wolves is estimated to be at least one hundred , including eleven breeding pairs . The gray wolf is fully protected in Sweden and partially controlled in Norway . The Scandinavian wolf populations owe their continued existence to neighbouring Finland 's <unk> with the Republic of <unk> , which houses a large population of wolves . Wolves in Finland are protected only in the southern third of the country , and can be hunted in other areas during specific seasons , though poaching remains common , with 90 % of young wolf deaths being due to human predation , and the number of wolves killed exceeds the number of hunting licenses , in some areas by a factor of two . Furthermore , the decline in the moose populations has reduced the wolf 's food supply . Since 2011 , Netherlands , Belgium and Denmark have also reported wolf sightings presumably by natural migration from adjacent countries . 
 Wolf populations in Poland have increased to about 800 – 900 individuals since being classified as a game species in 1976 . Poland plays a fundamental role in providing routes of expansion into neighbouring Central European countries . In the east , its range overlaps with populations in Lithuania , <unk> , Ukraine , and <unk> . A population in western Poland expanded into eastern Germany and in 2000 the first <unk> were born on German territory . In 2012 , an estimated 14 wolf packs were living in Germany ( mostly in the east ) and a pack with <unk> has been sighted within 15 miles of Berlin . The gray wolf is protected in <unk> , though an exception is made for wolves killing livestock . A few <unk> wolves disperse into the Czech Republic , where they are afforded full protection . Wolves in <unk> , Ukraine and Croatia may disperse into Hungary , where the lack of cover <unk> the buildup of an autonomous population . Although wolves have special status in Hungary , they may be hunted with a year @-@ round permit if they cause problems . 
 Romania has a large population of wolves , numbering 2 @,@ 500 animals . The wolf has been a protected animal in Romania since 1996 , although the law is not enforced . The number of wolves in <unk> and Macedonia is largely unknown , despite the importance the two countries have in linking wolf populations from Greece to those of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia . Although protected , sometimes wolves are still illegally killed in Greece , and their future is uncertain . Wolf numbers have declined in Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1986 , while the species is fully protected in neighbouring Croatia and Slovenia . 
 During the 19th century , gray wolves were widespread in many parts of the Holy Land east and west of the Jordan River . However , they decreased considerably in number between 1964 and 1980 , largely because of persecution by farmers . The species was not considered common in northern and central Saudi Arabia during the 19th century , with most early publications involving animals either from southwestern <unk> , northern rocky areas bordering Jordan , or areas surrounding <unk> . 
 There is little reliable data on the status of wolves in the Middle East , save for those in Israel and Saudi Arabia , though their numbers appear to be stable , and are likely to remain so . Israel 's conservation policies and effective law enforcement maintain a moderately sized wolf population , which radiates into neighbouring countries , while Saudi Arabia has vast tracts of desert , where about 300 – 600 wolves live undisturbed . The wolf survives throughout most of its historical range in Saudi Arabia , probably because of a lack of <unk> and abundant human waste . Turkey may play an important role in maintaining wolves in the region , because of its <unk> with Central Asia . The mountains of Turkey have served as a refuge for the few wolves remaining in Syria . A small wolf population occurs in the <unk> Heights , and is well protected by the military activities there . Wolves living in the southern <unk> desert are contiguous with populations living in the Egyptian Sinai and Jordan . Throughout the Middle East , the species is only protected in Israel . Elsewhere , it can be hunted year @-@ round by Bedouins . 
 Little is known of current wolf populations in Iran , which once occurred throughout the country in low densities during the mid @-@ 1970s . The northern regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan are important strongholds for the wolf . It has been estimated that there are about 300 wolves in approximately 60 @,@ 000 km2 ( 23 @,@ 000 sq mi ) of <unk> and <unk> in northern India , and 50 more in <unk> Pradesh . Overall , India supports about 800 @-@ 3 @,@ 000 wolves , scattered among several remnant populations . Although protected since 1972 , Indian wolves are classed as endangered , with many populations lingering in low numbers or living in areas increasingly used by humans . Although present in Nepal and <unk> , there is no information of wolves occurring there . 
 Wolf populations throughout Northern and Central Asia are largely unknown , but are estimated in the hundreds of thousands based on annual <unk> . Since the fall of the Soviet Union , continent @-@ wide <unk> of wolves has ceased , and wolf populations have increased to about 25 @,@ 000 – 30 @,@ 000 animals throughout the former Soviet Union . In China and Mongolia , wolves are only protected in reserves . Mongolian populations have been estimated at 10 @,@ 000 – 30 @,@ 000 , while the status of wolves in China is more fragmentary . The north has a declining population of an estimated 400 wolves , while Xinjiang and <unk> hold about 10 @,@ 000 and 2 @,@ 000 respectively . 
 Originally , the gray wolf occupied all of North America north of about 20 ° N. It occurred all over the mainland , save for the southeastern United States , California west of the Sierra Nevada , and the tropical and subtropical areas of Mexico . Large continental islands occupied by wolves included Newfoundland , Vancouver Island , southeastern <unk> islands , and throughout the Arctic Archipelago and Greenland . While <unk> and <unk> postulated that the gray wolf had never been present on Prince Edward Island , analysis of references to the Island ’ s native fauna in unpublished and published historical records has found that gray wolves were resident there at the time of the first French settlement in 1720 . In his 6 November 1721 letter to the French Minister of the Marine , Louis Denys de La <unk> reported that the Island was home to wolves “ of a prodigious size ” , and sent a wolf <unk> back to France to <unk> his claim . As the Island was cleared for settlement , the gray wolf population may have been extirpated , or relocated to the mainland across the winter ice : the few subsequent wolf reports date from the mid @-@ nineteenth century and describe the creatures as transient visitors from across the Northumberland Strait . 
 The decline of North American wolf populations coincided with increasing human populations and the expansion of agriculture . By the start of the 20th century , the species had almost disappeared from the eastern USA , excepting some areas of the <unk> and the northwestern Great Lakes Region . In Canada , the gray wolf was extirpated in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia between 1870 and 1921 , and in Newfoundland around 1911 . It vanished from the southern regions of Quebec and Ontario between 1850 and 1900 . The gray wolf 's decline in the <unk> began with the <unk> of the American bison and other ungulates in the 1860s – 70s . From 1900 – 1930 , the gray wolf was virtually eliminated from the western USA and adjoining parts of Canada , because of intensive predator control programs aimed at <unk> the species . The gray wolf was <unk> by federal and state governments from all of the USA by 1960 , except in Alaska and northern Minnesota . The decline in North American wolf populations was reversed from the 1930s to the early 1950s , particularly in southwestern Canada , because of expanding <unk> populations resulting from improved regulation of big game hunting . This increase triggered a resumption of wolf control in western and northern Canada . Thousands of wolves were killed from the early 1950s to the early 1960s , mostly because of poisoning . This campaign was halted and wolf populations increased again by the mid @-@ 1970s . 
 The species ' modern range in North America is mostly confined to Alaska and Canada , with populations also occurring in northern Minnesota , northern Wisconsin and Michigan 's Upper Peninsula , and portions of Washington , Idaho , northern Oregon , and Montana . A functional wolf population should exist in California by <unk> according to estimates by state wildlife officials . Canadian wolves began to naturally re @-@ <unk> northern Montana around Glacier National Park in 1979 , and the first wolf den in the western U.S. in over half a century was documented there in 1986 . The wolf population in northwest Montana initially grew as a result of natural reproduction and dispersal to about 48 wolves by the end of 1994 . From 1995 @-@ 1996 , wolves from Alberta and British Columbia were relocated to Yellowstone National Park and Idaho . In addition , the Mexican wolf ( Canis lupus <unk> ) was reintroduced to Arizona and New Mexico in 1998 . The gray wolf is found in approximately 80 % of its historical range in Canada , thus making it an important stronghold for the species . 
 Canada is home to about 52 @,@ 000 – 60 @,@ 000 wolves , whose legal status varies according to province and territory . First Nations residents may hunt wolves without restriction , and some provinces require licenses for residents to hunt wolves while others do not . In Alberta , wolves on private land may be <unk> and hunted by the landowner without requiring a license , and in some areas , wolf hunting <unk> programs exist . Large @-@ scale wolf population control through poisoning , trapping and aerial hunting is also presently conducted by government @-@ mandated programs in order to support populations of endangered prey species such as woodland <unk> . 
 In Alaska , the gray wolf population is estimated at 6 @,@ 000 – 7 @,@ 000 , and can be legally harvested during hunting and trapping seasons , with bag limits and other restrictions . As of 2002 , there are 250 wolves in 28 packs in Yellowstone , and 260 wolves in 25 packs in Idaho . The gray wolf received Endangered Species Act ( ESA ) protection in Minnesota , Wisconsin , and Michigan in 1974 , and was re @-@ classed from endangered to threatened in 2003 . <unk> Mexican wolves in Arizona and New Mexico are protected under the ESA and , as of late 2002 , number 28 individuals in eight packs . A female wolf shot in 2013 in Hart County , Kentucky by a hunter was the first gray wolf seen in Kentucky in modern times . DNA analysis by Fish and Wildlife laboratories showed genetic characteristics similar to those of wolves in the Great Lakes Region . 
 Wolves carry <unk> and <unk> , with wolves in the former Soviet Union having been recorded to carry at least 50 species . Most of these parasites infect wolves without adverse effects , though the effects may become more serious in sick or <unk> specimens . <unk> infection in wolves is of particular concern to people , as wolves can spread them to dogs , which in turn can carry the parasites to humans . In areas where wolves inhabit pastoral areas , the parasites can be spread to livestock . 
 Ancient Greek literature is similar : <unk> ( " the wolf itself " ) , <unk> ( " wolf @-@ work " ) . 
 The Latin for " female prostitute " is <unk> , and the most famous <unk> in Pompeii was the <unk> . 
 The wolf is a common motif in the <unk> <unk> and <unk> of peoples throughout Eurasia and North America ( corresponding to the historical extent of the habitat of the gray wolf ) . The obvious attribute of the wolf is its nature of a predator , and <unk> it is strongly associated with danger and destruction , making it the symbol of the warrior on one hand , and that of the devil on the other . The modern <unk> of the Big Bad Wolf is a development of this . The wolf holds great importance in the cultures and religions of the nomadic peoples , both of the Eurasian steppe and of the North American Plains . In many cultures , the identification of the warrior with the wolf ( <unk> ) gave rise to the notion of <unk> , the mythical or ritual identification of man and wolf . 
 Being the most abundant <unk> , feral and free @-@ ranging dogs have the greatest potential to compete with wolves . A review of the studies in the competitive effects of dogs on <unk> <unk> did not mention any research on competition between dogs and wolves . Competition would favor the wolf , which is known to kill dogs , however wolves tend to live in pairs or in small packs in areas where they are highly persecuted , giving them a disadvantage facing large groups of dogs . 
 Wolves kill dogs on occasion , with some wolf populations relying on dogs as an important food source . In Croatia , wolves kill more dogs than sheep , and wolves in Russia appear to limit stray dog populations . Wolves may display unusually bold behavior when attacking dogs accompanied by people , sometimes ignoring nearby humans . Wolf attacks on dogs may occur both in house yards and in forests . Wolf attacks on hunting dogs are considered a major problem in Scandinavia and Wisconsin . The most frequently killed hunting breeds in Scandinavia are <unk> , with older animals being most at risk , likely because they are less timid than younger animals , and react to the presence of wolves differently . Large hunting dogs such as Swedish <unk> are more likely to survive wolf attacks because of their better ability to defend themselves . 
 Although the numbers of dogs killed each year are relatively low , it <unk> a fear of wolves entering villages and <unk> to take dogs . In many cultures , there are strong social and emotional bonds between humans and their dogs that can be seen as family members or working team members . The loss of a dog can lead to strong emotional responses with demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations . 
 <unk> that are employed to guard sheep help to <unk> human – wolf conflicts , and are often proposed as one of the non @-@ lethal tools in the conservation of wolves . Shepherd dogs are not particularly aggressive , but they can disrupt potential wolf predation by displaying what is to the wolf ambiguous behaviors , such as <unk> , social <unk> , invitation to play or aggression . The historical use of <unk> dogs across Eurasia has been effective against wolf predation , especially when <unk> sheep in the presence of several livestock @-@ guarding dogs . However , <unk> dogs are sometimes killed by wolves . 
 Wild wolves are sometimes kept as exotic pets , and in some rarer occasions , as working animals . Although closely related to domesticated dogs , wolves do not show the same <unk> as dogs in living alongside humans , and generally , much more work is required in order to obtain the same amount of reliability . Wolves also need much more space than dogs , about 10 to 15 square miles so they can exercise . 
 In contemporary accounts <unk> was described as an <unk> speaker , and linguist <unk> <unk> suggests that he was among the first <unk> people to become fluent in English , which he learned through his many interactions with Anglo @-@ Americans . Like many <unk> men , <unk> was very tall , particularly by 19th @-@ century standards ; the United States Army estimated his height at 6 feet 4 inches ( 193 cm ) in 1861 . American author Albert S. Evans , writing in The <unk> Monthly , referred to him as " the old desert giant " . Edward Carlson , a soldier based at Fort <unk> who knew <unk> well in the 1860s , described him as having a powerful frame , but also a " very gentle " and " kind ... demeanor " . 
 On September 1 , 1857 , a joint force of <unk> and <unk> warriors launched a major attack with hundreds of warriors on a <unk> village close to <unk> Wells , Arizona , on the <unk> river . The Battle of <unk> <unk> was described by a group of white mail carriers who witnessed it . They stated that the battle was fought mostly with clubs , as well as bows and arrows , and that probably more than 100 warriors died , most of them from the attacking party . It is unknown whether <unk> participated in the attack , but given his status as <unk> , it is likely that he did . The battle has been described as the last major battle involving only Native American nations . This defeat put the <unk> on the defensive , wary of the possibility that whites would take this moment of weakness as an opportunity to begin settling on tribal lands . 
 Despite the accepted English translations , the words <unk> and <unk> do not mean a " ruler " or " boss " . <unk> describes <unk> government as " one of the least understood segments of <unk> culture " , and notes that while white officials " tended to act on the assumption that Indian chiefs exercised absolute authority " , as an elected leader <unk> was " primarily a servant of the tribe " . 
 <unk> moved on to Philadelphia and Washington , D.C. , where he earned great acclaim ; government officials and military officers lavished him with gifts of medals , swords , and photographs . In Washington he met with President Abraham Lincoln , who gave him a silver @-@ headed cane . He was the first Native American from the Southwest to meet an American president . The tour ended in April , when he and Moss sailed to California , again by way of Panama , and made their way back to <unk> 's Crossing from Los Angeles by wagon . 
 Upon <unk> 's return from Washington D.C. , he met with the <unk> while dressed in his major general 's uniform , with medals . He wore a European @-@ style hat and carried a long Japanese sword , and he told the <unk> about all the things he had seen . He tried to convince them that peace with the United States was in their best interests , and that war against them was futile , stressing their dominant military capabilities . Many <unk> were skeptical of his reports , and reacted with <unk> . 
 Mr. <unk> had marked out a reservation for the <unk> Indians in the upper part of the La <unk> valley on the East side of the Colorado River ... <unk> says this reservation is covered with sand and unfit for cultivation and the Indians are opposed to giving up their good lands in the <unk> Valley and moving to it ... <unk> says if he can have the valley below the Fort <unk> reserved for the home of the Indians , he is willing to give up all claims to lands on other parts of the river , and bring his Indians from La <unk> and other points to this valley ... I have full confidence in the friendship of <unk> towards white men , but not in his tribe , if troubles with any other Indians should occur , while he has more influence over them than any other chief , his control over them is not complete , and they are as likely to lead him ( as he is them ) . 
 Most of the <unk> refused to leave their ancestral <unk> for the reservation , but <unk> 's conviction that the reservation was their best option marked the beginning of a rift between his group and those who stayed behind to follow <unk> <unk> , the nation 's hereditary leader . According to an <unk> account by <unk> <unk> , <unk> explained his decision to move : 
 " You get angry sometimes ; I know you are brave men and think you can beat anybody . You thought you could beat the whites : you said so . I told you you could not ; the whites have beaten all tribes ; all are friends to them now . You did not listen to what I said when I told you that . You did what you thought , and many have got killed . If the soldiers come , you cannot resist them . You did not know that , but now you know it . The country down river from here , which we took away from another tribe [ the <unk> ] , I will live there . Those of you who want to go on fighting can stay here . I do not want to and will leave you . " 
 As the promised irrigation assistance was not immediately forthcoming , the first year at the reservation brought a drought that made it necessary for the <unk> to request food assistance . In 1867 , <unk> and the <unk> began to build an irrigation canal , digging by hand a ditch that ran for 9 miles ( 14 km ) . A report by a US official visiting the reservation in 1870 recorded that attempts by the <unk> at agricultural cultivation on the site were restricted to an area of not more than 40 acres ( 16 ha ) . 
 <unk> continued to lead the Colorado River band of <unk> during the 1860s . He pursued peaceful relations with the surrounding tribes and cooperated actively with US authorities . He also helped the <unk> and <unk> in ongoing conflicts with <unk> and <unk> . 
 The Colorado River band of <unk> never replaced <unk> ; he was their leader when he died at their reservation on May 3 or 4 , 1874 . His cause of death is unknown , but smallpox and natural causes are both cited . The <unk> <unk> deeply ; <unk> 's cremation and the rituals of mourning were reported in newspapers as far away as Omaha , Nebraska . <unk> was succeeded as leader on the Colorado <unk> by his nephew , <unk> <unk> of the <unk> clan , who upheld his uncle 's policies . 
 In 1966 , <unk> commented regarding <unk> 's legacy amongst the <unk> : " <unk> of his position in <unk> history from the <unk> viewpoint differs . To some he is an heroic figure , to others he was a white collaborator who did not stand up for <unk> rights . From the standpoint of white men who were conquering a wilderness , he was indeed the <unk> who worked <unk> for peace . " 
 The <unk> Society , a non @-@ profit charity run by the Colorado River Indian <unk> , was established in Parker , Arizona , in 1970 . The charity holds an annual <unk> <unk> or National Indian Days celebration . <unk> Hall , a sports venue in Parker , is also named after him . In 2002 , the US Bureau of Land Management designated 32 @,@ <unk> acres ( 13 @,@ 251 ha ) of the <unk> Mountains , contained largely within the Lake Mead National Recreation Area , as <unk> <unk> Wilderness . 
 The English poet Christopher Smart ( <unk> – 1771 ) was confined to mental <unk> from May 1757 until January 1763 . Smart was admitted into St Luke 's Hospital for <unk> , <unk> Green , London , on 6 May 1757 . He was taken there by his father @-@ in @-@ law , John <unk> , although he may have been confined in a private <unk> before then . While in St Luke 's he wrote <unk> <unk> and A Song to David , the poems considered to be his greatest works . Although many of his contemporaries agreed that Smart was " mad " , accounts of his condition and its ramifications varied , and some felt that he had been committed <unk> . 
 Smart was diagnosed as " <unk> " while at St Luke 's , and when they ran out of funds for his care he was moved to Mr. Potter 's <unk> . All that is known of his years of confinement is that he wrote poetry . Smart 's isolation led him to abandon the poetic genres of the 18th century that had marked his earlier work and to write religious poetry such as <unk> <unk> ( " <unk> in the Lamb " ) . His <unk> poetry reveals a desire for " <unk> revelation " , and it is possible that the self @-@ evaluation found in his poetry represents an expression of evangelical Christianity . 
 Late 18th @-@ century critics felt that Smart 's madness justified them in ignoring his A Song to David , but during the following century Robert <unk> and his contemporaries considered his condition to be the source of his genius . It was not until the 20th century , with the <unk> of <unk> <unk> ( not published until 1939 ) , that critics <unk> Smart 's case and began to see him as a revolutionary poet , the possible target of a plot by his father @-@ in @-@ law , a publisher , to silence him . 
 Christopher Smart was an English poet who was confined to <unk> during a time of debate about the nature of madness and its treatment . During the 18th century , madness was " both held to reveal inner truth and condemned to silence and exclusion as something <unk> by reason , and therefore threatening to society and to humanity " . It was commonly held to be an <unk> <unk> whose <unk> should be isolated from society . <unk> William <unk> — who later treated Smart — wrote : 
 [ we ] find that Madness is , contrary to the opinion of some <unk> persons , as <unk> as many other <unk> , which are equally <unk> and <unk> , and yet are not looked upon as <unk> , and that such unhappy objects ought by no means to be abandoned , much less shut up in <unk> prisons as criminals or <unk> to the society . 
 In 1758 , <unk> and others argued that those deemed " mad " were abused under the British <unk> system , and they pushed for parliamentary action . <unk> 's <unk> on Madness emphasised the problems of treating the hospitals as tourist attractions and the punitive measures taken against patients . The arguments of <unk> and others resulted in the passage of the Act for <unk> Private <unk> ( 1774 ) , but were too late to help Smart . 
 18th century treatment of <unk> was simple : they were to be fed daily a light diet of bread , <unk> , some meat or cheese , and a little amount of beer , which were inadequate in meeting daily nutritional needs ; they were denied contact with outsiders , including family members ; and they would be denied access to that which was deemed to be the cause of their madness ( these causes ranged from alcohol and food to working outside ) . If their actions appeared " <unk> and without <unk> cause " , then their condition would be labelled as " original " madness and deemed <unk> . An institution like St Luke 's , run by <unk> , held both " <unk> " and " <unk> " patients . There were few spots available for patients to receive free treatment , and many were released after a year to make room for new <unk> . 
 On 5 June 1756 , Smart 's father @-@ in @-@ law <unk> published , without permission , Smart 's Hymn to the Supreme Being , a poem which thanked God for recovery from an illness of some kind , possibly a " disturbed mental state " . During the illness , Smart was possibly confined to <unk> 's home and unable to write or be socially active . Out of sympathy for Smart , many of his friends , including writer and critic Samuel Johnson , began to write in the Universal <unk> to fulfill Smart 's contractual obligation to produce content for the magazine . The publication of Hymn to the Supreme Being marked the beginning of Smart 's obsession with religion and eventual confinement for madness because he began praying " without <unk> " . 
 Though the fortune as well as the constitution of Mr. Smart required the <unk> care , he was equally <unk> in the management of both , and his various and repeated <unk> acting upon an imagination <unk> <unk> , produced temporary <unk> of mind ; which at last were attended with <unk> so violent and continued as to render confinement necessary . 
 Hunter reports that Samuel Johnson visited Smart during the latter 's confinement , and it was Johnson that , " on the first approaches of Mr Smart 's <unk> , wrote several papers for a periodical publication in which that gentleman was concerned . " However , at no time did Smart ever believe himself to be insane ; these meetings began before Smart was ever put into <unk> because he still contributed , although not as significantly , to the Universal <unk> . In joking about writing for the Universal <unk> , Johnson claimed : " for poor Smart , while he was mad , not then knowing the terms on which he was engaged to write ... I hoped his <unk> would return to him . Mine returned to me , and I wrote in ' the Universal <unk> ' no longer . " 
 The specific events of Smart 's confinement are unknown . He may have been in a private <unk> before St Luke 's and later moved from St Luke 's to Mr Potter 's <unk> until his release . At St Luke 's , he transitioned from being " <unk> " to " <unk> " , and was moved to Mr Potter 's <unk> for monetary reasons . During Smart 's confinement time , his wife Anna left and took the children with her to Ireland . There is no record that he ever saw her again . His isolation led him into writing religious poetry , and he abandoned the traditional genres of the 18th century that marked his earlier poetry when he wrote <unk> <unk> . 
 During his time in <unk> , Smart <unk> himself with a daily ritual of writing poetry ; these lyric fragments eventually formed his <unk> <unk> and A Song to David . Smart might have turned to writing poetry as a way to focus the mind or as self @-@ therapy . Although 20th @-@ century critics debate whether his new poetic self @-@ examination represents an expression of evangelical Christianity , his poetry during his isolation does show a desire for " <unk> revelation " from God . There is an " inner light " that serves as a focal point for Smart and his poems written during his confinement , and that inner light connects him to the Christian God . 
 There is little information about Smart 's condition during his stay at St Luke 's , possibly because <unk> 's denied his patients from being visited , including by their own family members . One of the few records that survive of Smart 's time at St Luke 's was an entry in St Luke 's <unk> Book , which read : 
 Dr. <unk> having acquainted this Committee that Christopher Smart ( who was admitted on the 6th day of May 1757 ) continues disordered in his <unk> <unk> he has been admitted into this Hospital above 12 Calendar Months and from the present <unk> of his Case there is not <unk> reason to expect his <unk> Recovery And he being brought up and examined . <unk> . That he be discharged and that <unk> be sent to his <unk> to take him away . 
 During Smart 's confinement at St Luke 's , not even other doctors were allowed to see Smart unless they had received personal permission from <unk> . It was <unk> that Smart could have left the <unk> without being released by <unk> . Even if Smart would have attempted to obtain release via legal means , the rules for <unk> release would have been almost impossible to follow based on the system that <unk> had in place , which isolated the individual from all contact . Eventually , Smart was deemed " <unk> " and would not have been released by the hospital but for its lack of funds . 
 In London , only a few of his works were still being published , but the proceeds were taken by <unk> . However , Smart did get to see published a collection of his work under the pseudonym " Mrs Midnight " titled Mrs. Midnight 's <unk> ; and other Select <unk> : as they were spoken at the <unk> in the Hay @-@ Market , London . Smart did not profit from the work , but he was able to see at least some of his previous work being printed again . Smart , according to his 20th @-@ century biographer Arthur <unk> , had only " his God and his poetry " . A few of his loyal friends eventually grew tired of the treatment Smart received and freed him from Mr Potter 's . 
 Samuel Johnson 's biographer James Boswell described a moment when Charles Burney <unk> of his friend Johnson of Smart 's state . Johnson used the term " madness " to comment on the state of society before explaining to Burney that Smart 's actions that were deemed symptoms of madness were actually reasonable : 
 Madness frequently discovers itself merely by unnecessary <unk> from the usual mode of the world . My poor friend Smart <unk> the disturbance of his mind , by falling upon his knees , and saying his prayers in the street , or in any other unusual place . Now although , <unk> speaking , it is greater madness not to pray at all , than to pray as Smart did , I am afraid there are so many who do not pray , that their understanding is not called in question . 
 Concerning this unfortunate poet , Christopher Smart , who was confined in a mad @-@ house , he had , at another time , the following conversation with Dr [ Charles ] Burney : – Burney . ' How does poor Smart do , Sir ; is he likely to recover ? ' Johnson . ' It seems as if his mind had ceased to struggle with the disease ; for he grows fat upon it . ' Burney . ' Perhaps , Sir , that may be from want of exercise . ' Johnson . ' No , Sir ; he has partly as much exercise as he used to have , for he <unk> in the garden . Indeed , before his confinement , he used for exercise to walk to the <unk> @-@ house ; but he was carried back again . I did not think he ought to be shut up . His <unk> are not <unk> to society . He insisted on people praying with him ; and I 'd as <unk> pray with Kit [ = Christopher ] Smart as any one else . Another charge was that he did not love clean linen ; and I have no passion for it . ' – Johnson continued . ' <unk> have a great aversion to intellectual labour ; but even <unk> knowledge to be easily <unk> , more people would be content to be ignorant than would take even a little trouble to acquire <unk> 
 In an article printed in the Gentleman 's Magazine , <unk> <unk> , Smart 's acquaintance and Johnson 's close friend , argued that in many aspects Smart appears <unk> : 
 In every other transaction of life no man 's <unk> could be more regular than those of Smart , for this prevalence of one idea <unk> keeping the first place in his head had in no sense , except in what immediately related to itself , <unk> his judgement at all ; his opinions were unchanged as before , nor did he seem more likely to fall into a state of distraction than any other man ; less so , perhaps , as he <unk> every violent start of passion by prayer . 
 Beyond Smart 's circle of friends , few were willing to dismiss claims that Smart was affected by madness . Most contemporary literary critics knew of Smart 's time in <unk> and , upon publication of his A Song to David , called attention to aspects of the poem which they could use to claim that Smart was still " mad " . The view was widely held , and the poet William Mason wrote to Thomas Gray , " I have seen his Song to David & from <unk> conclude him as mad as ever . " 
 It was a century before a positive twist was put on Christopher Smart 's time in <unk> ; the Victorian poet Robert <unk> argued that A Song to David was great because Smart was mad at the time . In his poem <unk> ( 1887 ) , <unk> claimed : 
 To <unk> , Smart 's temporary madness was what allowed him to compose in A Song to David poetry similar to that of John Milton and John Keats . Christopher Smart , as <unk> 's poem continued , 
 <unk> 's remarks brought about a later appreciation of A Song to David and Smart 's madness . A review of <unk> 's <unk> claimed that Christopher Smart was " possessed by his subject ... and where there is true possession – where the fires of the poet 's imagination are not choked by self @-@ consciousness or by too much fuel from the <unk> – <unk> , <unk> , and even conventional formulae are for the time ' burnt and purged away ' . " 
 The 19th @-@ century poet Dante Gabriel <unk> emphasised the benefits of Smart 's madness and claimed that A Song to David was " the only great accomplished poem of the last century . " Two years later , Francis <unk> continued the theme when he wrote that the Song exhibited " noble <unk> and transitions from grandeur to <unk> , from Earth to Heaven " and that it was " unique in our Poetry . " Seven years after <unk> , critic John <unk> Collins agreed with <unk> and <unk> , but to a lesser extent , when he wrote , " This poem stands alone , the most extraordinary phenomenon , perhaps , in our literature , the one <unk> strain in the poetry of the eighteenth century , the work of a poet who , though he produced much , has not produced elsewhere a single line which indicates the power here displayed . " 
 Twentieth @-@ century critics favoured the view that Smart suffered from some kind of mental distress when writing his poems . A review by " Mathews " titled " <unk> <unk> " , in 30 March 1901 The Academy , claimed that : 
 Now Christopher Smart was a very <unk> poet of the eighteenth century [ ... ] but had not the smallest claim to rank with those great men beyond their common trade of poem . Kit Smart , in fact , though he wrote a <unk> deal of verse , could not write poetry — nor anything else [ ... ] <unk> mad , that is ; for he appears to have been very mad in his senses , and a decent citizen out of them . He went mad — legally and <unk> — once , and nothing came out of it , perhaps because he was not mad enough . Then he went mad again and being duly shut up in <unk> wrote one of the finest outbursts of lyric genius in the eighteenth century — perhaps the finest @-@ before the advent of Blake [ ... ] Smart regained his senses , and <unk> his <unk> inability to write poetry . And he never did anything after . 
 However , there are many that disagreed that Smart suffered from madness ; Edward <unk> and Charles <unk> , when discussing Smart 's Hymn to the Supreme Being , said , " The mind that composed this hymn was not <unk> . Yet in the poem one sees the <unk> religious mind which , in disorder , was to produce the <unk> <unk> , and , with order restored , the Song to David . Additionally , they claimed that Smart 's 
 <unk> excitement to prayer seems to have been poor Smart 's only real mental <unk> , unless his <unk> be considered <unk> . When his mind was removed entirely from the field of prayer , he was but little changed from his <unk> state . His powers of reason , though thus <unk> , were not taken from him , and he neither <unk> nor sank into mental <unk> . 
 Nevertheless , <unk> and <unk> were not completely <unk> about Smart 's diagnosis when they continued : " But when the desire to pray struck him , Smart abandoned what the world chose to call rationality . " 
 In 1960 , <unk> <unk> Brain diagnosed Smart as suffering from <unk> or manic depression . Brain based his diagnosis on Smart 's own claims about how he felt , and he concluded that " in Smart 's case the mental illness was not the result of his <unk> , but he drank because he was mentally unstable . " Arthur <unk> , in 1967 , argued that " The nature of Smart 's madness is impossible to <unk> at this distance in time " and then argued that : 
 The possible religious component of Smart 's condition was taken up by 20th @-@ century critics as an explanation for why the 18th century saw Smart as mad . Laurence <unk> , in 1934 , believed that religion played a major role in how society viewed Smart : " Smart 's madness seems to have taken the form of a literal interpretation of the injunction Pray without <unk> . He embarrassed visitors by insisting on their joining him in his <unk> [ ... ] <unk> with a fixed idea is a common form of <unk> . But such <unk> are a mental imprisonment ; whereas the Song is <unk> the expression of a great release . " <unk> 's idea was picked up by Sophia <unk> , in 1966 , who pointed out that society was <unk> against those who experienced enthusiasm , a strong spiritual connection to God . It was against religious prejudice that she argued , 
 The cause of Smart 's eclipse may be traced in part to a prejudice of the age , one which was founded in reason but developed in fear . There was one <unk> fact which hampered any clear perception of Smart 's work — he had been confined for madness . It was easier to use a difficult allusion or unusual image as evidence of madness than to interpret it . What could cause a fundamentally rational group of people to react so <unk> ? To some degree , it was the fear of ' enthusiasm ' . 
 In the 18th century , as <unk> continued , the word changed from possessed by god to inspired to falsely inspired . The result of this change was that British society viewed enthusiasm as the enemy to both reason and social order . Thus , " Smart , the hack @-@ writer , would not have been greeted by a hostile audience , but Smart , the enthusiast , would have been condemned immediately . The result would be obvious : his past work , previously lauded , would be ignored , and his future work would receive immediate <unk> such was the history of Smart 's contemporary reputation . " In determining if Smart was really mad or not , <unk> concluded , " in Smart 's day , any sign of enthusiasm would have been cause for the judgment of madness [ ... ] Two accounts of Smart and the nature of his madness have been preserved for us . Each permits some doubt that the poet was mad and could be regarded so in any age . " 
 " My Mother , the <unk> " is the ninth episode of the second season of the American mystery television series Veronica Mars , and the thirty @-@ first episode overall . Directed by Nick Marck , the episode was co @-@ written by Phil <unk> and <unk> <unk> North . The episode was first shown on November 30 , 2005 , on UPN . 
 The series depicts the adventures of Veronica Mars ( Kristen Bell ) as she deals with life as a high school student while <unk> as a private detective . In this episode , Veronica finds her mother 's old high school records and starts digging into her mother 's past , discovering information about the Kane family in the process . Meanwhile , Beaver ( Kyle <unk> ) proposes a business plan to help Kendall ( Charisma Carpenter ) . 
 " My Mother , the <unk> " features the third and final appearance by <unk> <unk> on the show . The show 's crew found it difficult to work an episode into <unk> 's schedule because of other projects . The episode was accompanied by an alternate ending , a publicity move made by executive producer Joel Silver and the UPN promotions department . The episode was initially viewed by 2 @.@ 82 million viewers and received mostly positive reviews . For example , Rowan Kaiser , of The A.V. Club , wrote " I am intrigued by the decisions to make Veronica less than pure , but this time , I 'm not as disappointed by the <unk> . " 
 Veronica asks Keith ( Enrico Colantoni ) about <unk> ’ s suspension , which she thinks was about spreading a rumor that Celeste was pregnant . Keith says that he doesn ’ t know anything about it . <unk> slips and falls during a play rehearsal . Beaver meets with Kendall and confronts her about selling his father ’ s possessions for little money . Beaver gives her his plan , which involves her being the face of his business idea . Keith checks the birth records and finds that no baby was born to either “ Kane ” or “ <unk> ” ( Celeste ’ s maiden name ) at that time . However , he finds a mysterious baby found in the girl ’ s bathroom at the Neptune high <unk> . Veronica bad @-@ mouths Celeste in Duncan ’ s room before Celeste comes in and Veronica learns that Duncan never told his parents about their relationship . Celeste insults Veronica ’ s mother , and Veronica <unk> that Celeste ’ s cleaning lady , <unk> , is probably her daughter . Weevil confronts Logan angrily , and they fight , despite agreeing that they need to team up to find out who actually killed Felix . 
 " My Mother , the <unk> " also marks <unk> 's third and final guest appearance on the show . <unk> was open to appearing in another episode , but she was unsure whether or not her busy schedule would allow it . She also felt that the character 's arc had come to a natural close in this episode . In an interview , Rob Thomas said that due to her busy schedule , it was difficult to write an episode featuring <unk> . On <unk> 's role in the episode and her future availability , Thomas commented : 
 Well , to work around <unk> ’ s schedule is really difficult for us . It ’ s hard to plan to write an episode with <unk> in it because we don ’ t know exactly what her free days are . Even the episode that we did with her , there was a huge <unk> , we actually had to slide that story line one episode down from when we originally wrote that . We ’ ve loved having <unk> in the show , and I ’ m sure we will again , some day , if she ’ s willing , because we ’ ve had a lot of fun with her . But we have nothing booked with her right now . 
 The episode also features a reappearance by Celeste Kane ( Lisa <unk> ) , a recurring character during the first season . The second season DVD includes an alternate ending to this episode , which was released around the airing of the episode as a promotional tool . The alternate ending starts the same way as the regular ending , with Veronica discovering that Meg is pregnant . But instead of the episode ending there , Meg 's mom comes into the room while Veronica hides in the bathroom . When the mom leaves , Meg is dead with a pillow over her face , indicating <unk> . However , Veronica takes the pillow off before a nurse comes in . Thomas commented that the alternate ending was never going to be the actual conclusion to the episode . He said : " We never seriously considered having that be the ending . There were various other endings that we did have , but they were so subtly different , it was like , ' When does Veronica enter the room ? ' " The idea to promote the alternate ending was a joint venture from the UPN promotions department and executive producer Joel Silver . After Thomas learned that others wanted an alternate ending , he decided to make it very different from the episode 's actual conclusion . " But once we could have a [ very different ] alternate ending , we thought , ' Let 's make it rock . ' The beauty of having that alternate ending is that we don 't have to play it out in the next episode . " 
 In its original broadcast , " My Mother , the <unk> " received 2 @.@ 82 million viewers , marking an increase from " <unk> , <unk> ! " and ranking 101st ( out of 112 ) in the weekly rankings . 
 The episode received mostly positive reviews . Price Peterson , of TV.com , gave the episode a positive review , writing that he " [ l ] <unk> this episode . That reveal was simultaneously shocking and heartbreaking . Plus it took one of the show 's most annoying characters ( <unk> ) and made her both sympathetic and heartbreaking . " He also praised the information found on Veronica 's mother : " It was nice that Veronica got to see a better side of her mother than we usually do … <unk> ! " Maureen Ryan , of the Chicago Tribune , called the episode " <unk> " and that it is a better use of a viewer 's time than Lost , which aired at the same time as Veronica Mars . 
 Rowan Kaiser , of The A.V. Club , lauded Veronica 's characterization as an <unk> in the episode . " I 've discussed times when [ Veronica has ] <unk> in ways that I 'm not certain are ethical , but this might be the most blatant case . [ … ] Once again , I am intrigued by the decisions to make Veronica less than pure , but this time , I 'm not as disappointed by the <unk> . " Television Without Pity gave the episode a " B " . Alan Sepinwall singled out the scene between Carpenter and <unk> and the Weevil and Logan subplot as particular points of praise . Sepinwall also called the alternate ending " an interesting little feature " while going on to state that he was " glad the real show didn 't go in that direction . " 
 <unk> ranked the episode 48th on its ranking of Veronica Mars episodes , writing that it made the viewer " bored . " On a similar list , TV Line ranked the episode 19th . 
 Rochdale Town Hall is a Victorian @-@ era municipal building in Rochdale , Greater Manchester , England . It is " widely recognised as being one of the finest municipal buildings in the country " , and is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building . The Town Hall functions as the ceremonial headquarters of Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council and houses local government departments , including the borough 's civil registration office . 
 Built in the Gothic Revival style at a cost of £ 160 @,@ 000 ( £ 13 @.@ 4 million in 2016 ) , it was inaugurated for the governance of the Municipal Borough of Rochdale on 27 September 1871 . The architect , William Henry <unk> , was the winner of a competition held in 1864 to design a new Town Hall . It had a 240 @-@ foot ( 73 m ) clock tower topped by a wooden spire with a gilded statue of Saint George and the Dragon , both of which were destroyed by fire on 10 April 1883 , leaving the building without a spire for four years . A new 190 @-@ foot ( 58 m ) stone clock tower and spire in the style of Manchester Town Hall was designed by Alfred <unk> , and erected in 1888 . 
 Art critic <unk> <unk> described the building as possessing a " rare picturesque beauty " . Its stained glass windows are credited as " the finest modern examples of their kind " . The building came to the attention of Adolf Hitler , who was said to have admired it so much that he wished to ship the building , brick @-@ by @-@ brick , to Nazi Germany had the United Kingdom been defeated in the Second World War . 
 Rochdale had developed into an increasingly large , populous , and prosperous urban mill town since the Industrial Revolution . Its newly built rail and canal network , and numerous factories , resulted in the town being " remarkable for many wealthy merchants " . In January 1856 the electorate of the Rochdale constituency petitioned the Privy Council for the grant of a charter of incorporation under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 , to constitute the town as a municipal borough . This would give it limited political autonomy via an elected town council , comprising a mayor , <unk> , and councillors , to oversee local affairs . The petition was successful and the charter was granted in September 1856 . The newly formed Rochdale Corporation — the local authority for the Municipal Borough of Rochdale — suggested plans to build a town hall in which to conduct its business in May 1858 . The site of an abandoned 17th @-@ century house known as The Wood was proposed . Six months later , in April 1860 , Rochdale Corporation arranged to buy the site on the outskirts of the town centre for £ 4 @,@ 730 ( £ <unk> @,@ 000 in 2016 ) . However , plans were <unk> due to lengthy negotiations and increasing land prices . In January 1864 the scheme resumed with a new budget of £ 20 @,@ 000 ( £ 1 @,@ 690 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) . 
 The wood and surrounding area were cleared , but it is unknown what became of the <unk> ; there was no legal requirement for the authorities to <unk> the former inhabitants . A design competition to find a " <unk> and elegant building " was held by the Rochdale Corporation , who offered the winning architect a prize of £ 100 ( £ 8 @,@ 900 in 2016 ) , and a Maltese cross <unk> . From the 27 entries received , William Henry <unk> 's was chosen . The Rochdale @-@ born Radical and Liberal statesman John Bright laid the foundation stone on 31 March 1866 . Construction was complete by 1871 although the cost had , by then , increased beyond expectations from the projected £ 40 @,@ 000 to £ 160 @,@ 000 ( £ 13 @,@ 440 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) . 
 In 1882 or 1883 dry rot was found in the 240 @-@ foot ( 73 m ) high spire . On the recommendation of Rochdale 's Borough <unk> , contractors were engaged to rebuild it . The spire was to be demolished to clear the way for a replacement . It was rumoured that the <unk> who were <unk> the top section of the wooden spire may have tried to speed up the <unk> process with matches and , at 9 : 20 am on 10 April 1883 , a <unk> was discovered . Despite the efforts of volunteers and the local fire brigade , 100 minutes after the discovery of the fire the entire spire , including a statue of Saint George and the Dragon , had been destroyed . The cause of the fire was never established , but Rochdale 's fire service was criticised for taking longer to respond to the <unk> than Oldham 's , ( based 5 miles ( 8 km ) south ) , despite the Rochdale Fire Brigade being based in the Town Hall . Alfred <unk> was given the task of designing a 190 @-@ foot ( 58 m ) stone replacement . His work on the clock tower , which was built between 1885 and 1887 about 15 yards ( 14 m ) further to the east than the original , shows many similarities to Manchester Town Hall , which he also designed . The tower was opened in 1888 ; an inscribed plaque commemorates the fire of 1883 . 
 On 15 January 1931 , at the height of the Great Depression in the United Kingdom , the Territorial Army was called to guard the Town Hall during a protest against unemployment and hunger . 
 In May 1938 , Rochdale @-@ born actress , singer and comedian Gracie Fields was granted Honorary Freedom of the Borough for her contribution to entertainment . " When the ceremony was over , Gracie went onto the town hall balcony to receive the cheers and good wishes of the thousands of people who were packing the streets below . " 
 Although it is not fully understood how it came to his attention , Rochdale Town Hall was admired by Adolf Hitler . It has been suggested a visit by Hitler in 1912 – 13 while staying with his half @-@ brother <unk> Hitler , Jr. in Liverpool , or military intelligence on Rochdale , or information from Nazi <unk> William Joyce ( who had lived in Oldham ) , brought the building to his attention . Hitler admired the architecture so much that it is believed he wished to ship the building , brick @-@ by @-@ brick , to Nazi Germany had German @-@ occupied Europe encompassed the United Kingdom . Rochdale was broadly avoided by German bombers during the Second World War . 
 At OS <unk> Reference <unk> ( 53 @.@ <unk> ° , − 2 @.@ <unk> ° ) , Rochdale Town Hall is the centerpiece of Rochdale , located in Town Hall Square to the south of The <unk> and the River <unk> . The Parish Church of St Chad is situated by the wooded hillside behind the Town Hall . In Town Hall Square , opposite the Town Hall , is a statue of John Bright , dated 1891 , and the Rochdale War Memorial . Bright was a Rochdale @-@ born <unk> , pacifist and Member of Parliament for Birmingham known for his campaigns to repeal the Corn Laws as well as his opposition to slavery in the United States and the Crimean War . <unk> Rochdale art gallery and local studies centre is across The <unk> . 
 The frontage and principal entrance of the Town Hall face the River <unk> , and comprises a portico of three arches intersected by buttresses . <unk> the main entrance are stone <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . Four gilded lions above a parapet around three sides of the portico bear shields carrying the coats of arms of Rochdale Council and the hundred of Salford . 
 Rochdale Town Hall is 264 feet ( 80 m ) wide , 123 feet ( 37 m ) deep , and is faced with <unk> grit <unk> from Blackstone Edge and <unk> . Although now <unk> by industrial pollution , the building has been described as a " rich example of domestic Gothic architecture " . <unk> carved foliage on the exterior recalls the style of <unk> Minster , and the architecture is influenced by <unk> Period and medieval town halls of continental Europe . The building has been likened to Manchester Town Hall , Manchester <unk> Courts , the Royal Courts of Justice , and St <unk> railway station , all products of the Gothic Revival architectural movement . The stained glass windows , some of which were designed by William Morris , have been described as " the finest modern examples of their kind " . At each end of the frontage is an octagonal staircase . 
 The present clock tower , which has a stone spire , was built to replace the one destroyed in the 1883 fire . It was designed by Alfred <unk> in a similar style to one of his earlier works , the clock tower of Manchester Town Hall . The first stone was laid by Thomas Schofield JP , <unk> and Rochdale Borough Councillor , on 19 October 1885 and the tower was declared complete on 20 June 1887 , the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria . It contains five bells which ring on the hour and at 15 @-@ minute intervals . The design of the original tower was more elaborate and 50 feet ( 15 m ) higher than its successor , which is 190 feet ( 58 m ) tall . 
 The tower rises from a <unk> and has four stages including the gable @-@ headed clock stage , which is also decorated with pinnacles . A small stone spire completes the composition . 
 The Town Hall was listed at Grade I on 25 October 1951 . Such buildings are defined as being of " exceptional interest , sometimes considered to be internationally important " . In February 2001 , it was one of 39 Grade I listed buildings , and 3 @,@ 701 listed buildings of all grades , in Greater Manchester . Within the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale , it is one of only three Grade I listed buildings , and 312 listed buildings of all grades . 
 Although the majority of local government functions take place in Rochdale 's Municipal <unk> building , Rochdale Town Hall continues to be used for cultural and ceremonial functions . For instance it is used for the Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale 's <unk> , civil registry , and for formal <unk> in British <unk> ceremonies . 
 Colin Leslie <unk> ( 9 December 1916 – 5 April 1986 ) was an Australian <unk> who played in 14 Tests from 1946 to 1950 . <unk> , born in <unk> , New South Wales , was an all @-@ <unk> who bowled leg spin and <unk> with a round arm action and as a lower order batsman was regarded as effective square of the wicket and against spin bowling . He made his Test <unk> against New Zealand in 1946 , taking a wicket with his second delivery . He was part of Donald Bradman 's <unk> team that toured England in 1948 but injury saw him miss selection in any of the Test matches . 
 A good tour of South Africa in 1949 – 50 was followed by a lack of opportunity in the next two seasons , leading <unk> to sign a contract to play professional cricket in the Lancashire League in 1953 . Three years later , Somerset County Cricket Club recruited <unk> where he was a success , especially as a middle @-@ order batsman ; he played five seasons and saw the club achieve its highest place in the County Championship since 1892 . He retired from cricket in 1960 and returned to Australia to work as a market <unk> . He died in Concord , New South Wales on 5 April 1986 . 
 <unk> enlisted on 12 September 1941 and served as a Pilot Officer with the No. 33 Squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) . <unk> in New Guinea , <unk> had reached the rank of Flight Lieutenant when he was discharged from the RAAF on 18 September 1945 . 
 After the war , he moved to Brisbane and was selected in the Queensland cricket team . Playing for Queensland , he formed a formidable partnership with wicket @-@ keeper Don <unk> . He was selected in the Australian team to tour New Zealand in 1945 – 46 , making his Test <unk> at the Basin Reserve in Wellington . He made seven runs in Australia 's only innings and took a wicket with his second ball in Test cricket ; the last man dismissed in the Test , Don McRae . 
 The following season , Wally Hammond 's England cricket team travelled to Australia for the 1946 – 47 Ashes series . In a warm @-@ up match before the series , <unk> performed well for Queensland against the English tourists at the Brisbane Cricket Ground ( the ' <unk> ) , taking nine wickets and " the English batsmen seemed like rabbits fascinated in the presence of a snake " . He was selected for the First Test at the same ground the following week . He just missed out on a century on his Ashes debut , scoring 95 and only bowling one over as Australia won the Test by an innings and <unk> runs . In the Second Test at Sydney , <unk> took eight wickets , including the prize wicket of Hammond twice . Australia won by an innings and 33 runs . The Third Test at Melbourne saw <unk> make his maiden Test century , 104 not out in a drawn match . The Melbourne businessman and underworld figure , John Wren had promised <unk> one pound for every run he made that innings ; this was at a time when ten pounds was the average weekly wage in Australia . The <unk> — given to <unk> the next day — allowed him to place a deposit on a house . 
 He played in the remaining two Tests , making 272 runs at an average of 54 and taking 18 wickets at just over 27 apiece . He took 5 / 44 in the Fifth Test . Wisden <unk> ' <unk> wrote that his batting featured " <unk> cuts " and " vigorous hooks " , opining that there were " few better players of spin bowling on a difficult pitch " . Wisden said that his slow and <unk> leg spin was " a clever mixture of leg @-@ breaks and <unk> " . 
 India toured Australia for the first time in 1947 – 48 . <unk> played in three Tests without much success , scoring only 46 runs and taking only four wickets . Nevertheless , he was selected as part of Australian team to tour England in 1948 that would be known as the <unk> . He took 57 wickets on the tour but bowling for long periods caused him to continually tear a <unk> on his third finger , used to <unk> spin on the ball . As a result , his captain , Don Bradman , felt compelled to leave him out of the Test matches , feeling that his finger would not be able to handle the necessarily long bowling spells . This decision was aided by the then existing rule allowing a new ball to be used every 55 overs , allowing Bradman to use his fast bowlers more often . For the rest of his career , <unk> was troubled by the skin rubbing off his spinning finger . <unk> and his fellow fringe members of the squad , Ron <unk> and Doug Ring , would refer themselves as the " ground @-@ staff " as it was unlikely that the tour <unk> would include them in the Test team that tour . The cricket writer Alan Gibson , who knew <unk> well in his later cricket career at Somerset , wrote that the omission " distressed him greatly at the time , though he could be philosophical enough about it later " . 
 He played in all five Tests on tour against South Africa . He took 51 wickets in all matches , including 5 / 41 in the Second Test at <unk> . In 1950 – 51 , <unk> was the leading wicket taker in the Sheffield Shield competition , however he was not selected in the Test team against the touring English ; nor against the West Indies the following season . 
 Prior to the 1953 Australian team to tour England , <unk> signed a professional contract with Lancashire League team East Lancashire , replacing fellow Australian leg spinner Bruce <unk> . In his first season in the league , he was the leading wicket @-@ taker with 93 wickets at the low average of 10 @.@ 2 runs per wicket , and he also made <unk> runs at an average of 33 @.@ 9 . The following year , he played less often : his <unk> runs came at the better average of 42 @.@ 1 but his 52 wickets cost 13 @.@ 1 apiece , and East Lancashire , who had finished either first or second in the Championship ten times in the previous twelve seasons , finished 10th out of 14 . He did not return to East Lancashire for the 1955 season due to being contracted to play county cricket for Somerset . The cricket writer Alan Gibson , who knew <unk> well , wrote that " after he had made the decision to come , an extension of the qualifying period for overseas cricketers kept him waiting even longer " . 
 <unk> by the change to the rules , <unk> had a five @-@ year stint from 1956 in English county cricket . Somerset , having finished on the bottom of the County Championship table for the four years between 1952 – 1955 , had embarked on a renewal programme . Part of the programme involved a vigorous recruiting campaign , including an offer to <unk> that saw him return to first @-@ class cricket at the age of 39 . 
 At Somerset , <unk> was an instant success as a batsman , scoring 1 @,@ <unk> runs in his first season , including three centuries and a highest score of 141 . After four seasons , Somerset came off the bottom of the County Championship ( to 15th out of 17 ) , and Wisden was in no doubt of <unk> 's influence : " Much of the credit for the all @-@ round improvement went to one man – <unk> , " it wrote . " At the start of the season it was hoped that the former Australian Test leg @-@ break bowler would lend power and variety to the attack . From that viewpoint his 45 wickets at over thirty runs apiece might be counted disappointing . But with the bat <unk> exceeded all expectations . He was one of the most consistent scorers in the country and he failed by only 34 to reach 2 @,@ 000 runs in his first season of county cricket . <unk> was the backbone of a mediocre batting side , and he never departed from his natural attacking style . " Against the touring Australians that season he made 90 and 116 , the first innings 90 coming out of 139 in two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hours and including 15 fours , the second innings century out of 167 in just 95 minutes , with four <unk> and 14 fours . Wisden reported that he was " very severe on [ Ian Johnson ] and [ Jack Wilson ] " . 
 Over the 1956 / 57 new year , <unk> was one of a party of 12 cricketers , all but one of them Test players , who made a brief trip to India to play two first @-@ class matches in celebration of the silver jubilee of the Bengal Cricket Association in a side raised by the Lancashire secretary Geoffrey Howard . <unk> did not play in the first match and in the second , he replaced Jock Livingston , the team 's only <unk> , who had been taken ill during the first game . <unk> made only 23 and 1 with the bat , but he <unk> <unk> <unk> off the bowling of <unk> , one of only two <unk> in his career as a very occasional <unk> . 
 Back in England in 1957 he was joined at Taunton by another Australian , Bill <unk> , but still finished as the leading scorer for the county with 1 @,@ <unk> runs in all matches , to go with 44 wickets . In the wet summer of 1958 Somerset finished third in the Championship , their highest position since 1892 . <unk> 's contribution was 1 @,@ 590 runs and 46 wickets at , for him , the low average of 23 runs each . In this season , <unk> made his highest score for Somerset – 169 out of a total of 314 against Worcestershire at <unk> – and in the last match of the season he produced his best bowling figures of his career , taking eight second @-@ innings Nottinghamshire wickets for 74 runs on what Wisden described as " a sporting pitch " . 
 In contrast to 1958 , the 1959 season was hot and dry and <unk> 's figures improved : he made 1769 runs at an average of more than 40 runs per innings and took 64 first @-@ class wickets , more than in any other Somerset season . <unk> 's final season with Somerset before his retirement was 1960 , and he signed off with 1 @,@ 222 runs and 29 wickets . 
 In 138 matches across the five seasons for Somerset , <unk> made 7 @,@ <unk> runs at an average of 33 @.@ 82 . He also took 219 wickets at 28 @.@ 05 but in his five years with the county he was never the first @-@ choice spin bowler : in his first two seasons , Somerset used Australian @-@ born slow left @-@ arm orthodox bowler John McMahon as the main spin bowler , with young off @-@ spin bowler Brian <unk> also bowling more than <unk> . When McMahon left , <unk> took over as the top spin bowler , and by 1960 was bowling four times the number of overs that <unk> took . But <unk> had also lost some of his control at this stage : " He could do <unk> things with the ball , though length and line seemed to become a decreasing consideration , " says the history of Somerset cricket . He also made 146 catches , many of them at first slip , where he stood " rather deeper than usual " . His influence on Somerset 's recovery from the trough of the early 1950s was considerable . A later Somerset history says : " Occasionally some of the younger <unk> didn 't <unk> the way he treated them . Maybe they also resented that his salary was well in excess of their own . But their respect for his competitive approach and sheer experience was undeniable . " 
 <unk> had a round @-@ arm bowling action , releasing the ball with his arm almost parallel to the ground . Before he developed problems with the skin on his spinning finger , he was , in spite of his unorthodox action , able to generate sharp spin . The cricket writer , Jack Pollard said of <unk> , " [ <unk> ] was almost <unk> on badly prepared pitches , so wide and sharp was the turn of his leg @-@ breaks . " and that he " made even State [ i.e. first @-@ class ] batsmen look inept " . On the advice of coaches and ex @-@ players , <unk> attempted to alter his action to a more orthodox style on several occasions but always returned to his natural style . 
 A short man but with a strong build , as a batsman he was a vigorous <unk> and a <unk> cutter , scoring mostly square of the wicket . He was particularly good against spin bowling , even on difficult pitches . 
 During his time at Somerset , he was known for " [ turning ] a match with his <unk> <unk> in an hour . " Alan Gibson wrote : " We hardly think of him as a stylist , and he was mostly a back @-@ foot player , getting the greater number of his runs in the segments <unk> out from point and square @-@ leg . But he was enjoyable to watch , compact , <unk> , combining powerful hitting with delicate placing . In the best Somerset tradition , he was always after the bowling , and in the best Australian tradition , he always <unk> a fight . " But he also adapted his style to suit English pitches : in an early innings for Somerset , he was out trying to hook a ball from Trevor Bailey . " The hook , he decided , was a stroke to be used <unk> on English pitches ... <unk> was constantly <unk> his technique that season [ 1956 ] , whenever he spotted a flaw in his method . Again and again he held the Somerset batting together . Nothing in his previous experience had equipped him for the task of holding up a losing side in a <unk> English summer . " 
 He was renowned for his catching , often spending an hour at a time <unk> catching a ball thrown into the side of a roller normally used to prepare the cricket pitch . Journalist and former team @-@ mate Bill O <unk> said after <unk> 's death in 1986 : " If Colin had played in the last 10 years , he would have been regarded as one of the greatest all @-@ <unk> ever in Australian cricket . He was a great batsman , [ ... ] a wonderful bowler and one of the best slips <unk> I have ever seen . " 
 Accounts of <unk> in his Somerset period portray him as a thoughtful but slightly aloof character . " Off the field he was a quiet man , " wrote David Foot . He was " a contemplative pipe @-@ smoker in the corner of the dressing room , " says another account , and somewhat <unk> of others who appeared less committed than he was . " Occasionally some of the younger <unk> didn 't <unk> the way he treated them . Maybe they also resented that his salary was well in excess of their own . " 
 Alan Gibson wrote about him more <unk> : " He thought about the game a lot . Many Australian cricketers do , more than English cricketers probably , but <unk> was in some ways an <unk> Australian . He had a <unk> and <unk> , which do not always spring to mind as familiar Australian qualities : but he had plenty of Australian determination . " 
 Gibson wrote that <unk> " did not quite come to terms with the West Country " . He went on : " He missed the sunshine . ' There 's no winter , ' he said , ' and the beer 's better . And the <unk> off @-@ spinners don 't turn . ' I think an additional reason was that he found some difficulty in accepting the conventions of English cricket as it was then . There was a Somerset committee member , who liked and admired him , and would <unk> him with , ' Morning , <unk> ' . That committee member was seeking to be <unk> . He would have thought it <unk> to say ' Mr <unk> ' , and <unk> to say ' Colin ' . But it infuriated Colin . He thought it a reflection on his status . He would have preferred something like ' Hi , <unk> , you old <unk> . ' The worlds were too far apart . " 
 <unk> was given a testimonial season by Somerset in 1959 after just three years with county and the circumstances were unusual enough for it to be remarked on in the county 's Year Book , published in the winter before the season . " Although Colin <unk> has played for the County for three seasons only , this <unk> is a fitting reward for his valuable services as an all @-@ <unk> and off the field , where his influence is most marked . " 
 After retirement from first @-@ class cricket at the end of the 1960 season in England , <unk> returned to Australia , taking up market <unk> with a specialty in rare blooms at <unk> Beach on the Central Coast of New South Wales . He continued playing club cricket in the Newcastle competition for <unk> until <unk> forced him to retire from all forms of cricket aged 55 : " <unk> in my right hand made it embarrassing for me to continue . It was <unk> to an old pro like me who <unk> himself on length and directions to have the ball slip out of my fingers out of control . " 
 <unk> was the author of two books on cricket : Cricket is a Game , which was an autobiography , and The Best Way to Play Cricket , both published in 1961 . John <unk> , reviewing them in Wisden 1962 , said the first was " full of <unk> good sense , humour , <unk> and <unk> observation " . The second book , <unk> wrote , was " to the best of this reviewer 's knowledge , the first cricket book to be initially published in the modern paper @-@ back format " . It was , he added , " full of good instruction and ... sets down some genuine cricket wisdom with freshness and vitality " . 
 He married Dorothy <unk> <unk> in 1943 in Sydney . His son , Russ <unk> , who was born in Taunton , played one first @-@ class match for Somerset in 1982 , in addition to playing for New South Wales Colts and New South Wales Country . 
 The game 's hand @-@ drawn aesthetic — a style new to the series — descends from producer and Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto 's <unk> for the computer pre @-@ rendered graphics of the game 's contemporary <unk> Kong Country . <unk> 's Island was released in Japan in August 1995 , and worldwide two months later . Some of its special effects were powered by a new Super <unk> <unk> . The game was <unk> for the Game Boy Advance with few changes in 2002 under the title <unk> 's Island : Super Mario Advance 3 . Nintendo later released this version via the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U Virtual <unk> . 
 <unk> 's Island is a two @-@ dimensional side @-@ scrolling platformer in which players help friendly dinosaurs known as <unk> escort Baby Mario safely through 48 levels across six worlds in order to rescue his brother Luigi , who had been kidnapped by an evil <unk> named <unk> . 
 Each of the game 's worlds feature eight main levels , with a boss appearing at the end of every fourth and eighth level . <unk> throughout each of these levels are five Flowers and twenty Red Coins , the latter of which are hidden behind specific coins in each level . <unk> Flowers adds flowers to the gate at the end of each level ( not including boss levels ) . If the player manages to land on an open flower after jumping through the end gate , they can play a bonus game during which they can earn extra lives or bonus items that can be activated from the pause menu , such as additional stars or <unk> glasses that reveal the location of hidden Red Coins . At the end of each level , players receive a score based on how many Flowers and Red Coins they found , as well as how many stars they have remaining , with a maximum score of 100 awarded for finding all Flowers and Red Coins and ending the level with 30 stars . <unk> all levels in a world with a score of 100 unlocks two additional levels for that world . 
 The Game Boy Advance version of the game was released on the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U via Nintendo 's digital Virtual <unk> platform . The port retains the handheld version 's cropped screen and pack @-@ in Mario Bros. game , though its multiplayer mode is disabled .

 In 1942 – 43 , the battalion took part in fighting along the <unk> Track before returning to Australia where it spent over a year training and being rebuilt . In December 1944 , the 2 / 3rd returned to New Guinea to take part in the Aitape – <unk> campaign and remained there until the war ended . Following the end of hostilities , the battalion was disbanded on 8 February 1946 in Brisbane . The battalion 's battle honours are <unk> by the Royal New South Wales Regiment . 
 Upon the outbreak of the Second World War the Australian government decided to raise an all @-@ volunteer force for service overseas , due to the provisions of the Defence Act ( 1903 ) which restricted the deployment of the part @-@ time Militia to only those areas considered to be Australian territory . This force was known as the Second Australian Imperial Force ( 2nd AIF ) , and the 6th Division was the first to be raised . As a unit of this formation , the 2 / 3rd Battalion was formed at Victoria Barracks , Sydney , on 24 October 1939 . Along with the 2 / 1st , 2 / 2nd and 2 / 4th Battalions , the 2 / 3rd was assigned to the 16th Brigade . 
 Although initially the infantry battalions of the 6th Division adopted the Australian battalion structure of two rifle companies , a support company , a light machine gun platoon and an administrative headquarters , they soon switched to the British structure with four rifle companies – each consisting of three platoons with three sections – and a headquarters company consisting of signals , carrier , pioneer , anti @-@ aircraft , transport , administrative and mortar platoons . 
 Following a brief period of training at Liverpool and <unk> , the battalion took part in a farewell march through Sydney . The Sydney Morning Herald of 4 January 1940 gave an account of their farewell march : " The long <unk> columns thrilled the hearts of Sydney as it had not been so moved for a quarter of a century since that still , spring day in 1914 when the first <unk> marched through the same streets on its way to Anzac and <unk> glory ; the marching was magnificent . " Afterwards , the battalion sailed in the first troop convoy to leave Australia on 10 January 1940 , embarking upon the transport <unk> . They disembarked at El Kantara on the Suez Canal on 14 February 1940 , and from there they were <unk> to their camp at <unk> in Palestine , where they undertook further training . 
 The first engagement that Australian troops were involved in during the Second World War came at <unk> , a major Italian military outpost in the north of Libya . The 16th Brigade broke through <unk> 's western defensive perimeter at dawn on 3 January 1941 , when the 2 / 1st Battalion breached the wire defences and swung left before advancing . The 2 / 2nd Battalion followed suit , swinging to the right , and the 2 / 3rd then moved straight through the breach . Meanwhile , the 17th Brigade led a diversion to the south . Although the 16th Brigade was able to capture <unk> in the late afternoon of 4 January , resistance continued , and fighting did not cease until the next morning . Over 40 @,@ 000 Italians were captured along with significant amounts of equipment and material – including food and ammunition – which was in short supply . A significant amount of alcohol was also captured by the Australians in Italian <unk> inside the 2 / 3rd 's position around Wadi @-@ el @-@ <unk> . During this period , the 2 / 3rd lost five officers and 56 men killed or wounded . 
 After this , the Allied forces advanced to the fortified naval outpost of <unk> . The 6th Division attacked the perimeter defences early on 21 January , following a week of continuous bombardment from both land and sea . The 2 / 3rd Battalion was tasked with breaching the outer Italian defences for the 2 / 1st Battalion to pass through . Following the initial breakthrough , the 2 / 3rd then advanced west along the inner ring of defences , attacking a number of Italian posts as they went . <unk> fell the next day , with the Italians surrendering to Brigadier Horace Robertson , the commander of the 19th Brigade . The Italian flag was taken down and in the absence of an Australian flag , a <unk> from the 2 / 4th Battalion tied his <unk> hat to the flag staff and hauled it up to the top . The battalion 's losses during the fighting for <unk> were seven officers and 50 men killed or wounded . 
 Following the capture of the town , the 2 / 3rd garrisoned <unk> , although B Company was detached to the 19th Brigade for its assault on <unk> , and remained there after its capture on 30 January . Prime Minister Robert <unk> interrupted his journey from Australia to England to address the troops after the capture of <unk> . On 7 March 1941 , the battalion left <unk> , along with the rest of the 6th Division , to bolster the Allied defences in Greece . 
 On 18 March 1941 , the 2 / 3rd Battalion sailed from Alexandria aboard HMS Gloucester , arriving in Greece and landing in the port of <unk> on the following day , after a 22 @-@ hour voyage during which their convoy had been attacked numerous times by Axis aircraft . After the invasion of the country on 6 April , they were moved north to attempt to turn back the German forces . The following day they occupied <unk> , and on 12 April the 6th Division was grouped together with the 2nd New Zealand Division and a lone British brigade to form an Anzac Corps . This formation did not last long , however , as the Greek government requested Allied forces withdraw from Greece on 16 April before <unk> organised resistance on 18 April . Due to a series of <unk> elsewhere , the battalion was forced to pull back from its positions at <unk> and did not come into contact with the Germans until 18 April when they attempted to block passage of the <unk> <unk> . Fighting alongside the 2 / 2nd Battalion and New Zealanders , the rearguard action was successful and enabled the Allies to withdraw to the south . Brigadier Arthur Allen , commander of the 16th Brigade , later wrote of this encounter : " it was a fantastic battle . Everyone was on top , with no time to dig in , and all in the front line , including artillery , Bren carriers and infantry , as well as headquarters , with transport only yards in the rear . Some confusion could be expected in the circumstances , with every weapon firing and aircraft almost continually <unk> from above . If you saw it in the cinema you would say the author had never seen battle . " 
 With the Germans enjoying numerical superiority on the ground , and with the Luftwaffe in total control of the skies , they then captured the township of <unk> . Although fierce rearguard fighting continued while the Australian and New Zealand forces withdrew to a new defensive line at <unk> , the situation deteriorated . An official evacuation plan was issued on 21 April , and on 25 April – Anzac Day – parties of evacuating Allied troops marched through Athens on their way to the coast . The 2 / 3rd Battalion embarked from <unk> on 27 April . The 2 / 3rd 's casualties during the campaign amounted to 14 killed , 31 wounded and 62 captured . 
 While the majority of the 2 / 3rd Battalion was successfully evacuated to Egypt , a small force of 141 men were evacuated to the island of Crete instead , after the transport ship they were on was sunk . Having formed the rearguard during the withdrawal from Greece , they had embarked separately from the main body , being taken aboard the Costa Rica . During the voyage to Alexandria , the transport had been attacked by German aircraft , and as it sank , they were ordered to abandon ship . After being rescued by Royal Navy destroyers , the troops were transported to Crete , where they were formed into a composite battalion with men from other units of the 16th Brigade , and together the unit became known as the 16th Brigade Composite Battalion . 
 With only limited small arms and ammunition they moved to positions above <unk> on the shores of <unk> Bay to undertake garrison duties in anticipation of a German attack on the island . Following the German invasion on 20 May 1941 , some of these troops saw direct action against German paratroopers . After the Allied evacuation from the island a week later , they undertook active patrols around the island before being evacuated on 31 May 1941 aboard HMS Phoebe . They arrived in Alexandria on 1 June 1941 . Two 2 / 3rd Battalion men were killed during the fighting on Crete , and one was wounded . Fifty became prisoners of war . Meanwhile , the rest of the battalion had concentrated in Palestine , where it was rebuilt in advance of its next campaign . 
 Australian troops from the 7th Division were already fighting in the Syria – Lebanon Campaign when the re @-@ formed 2 / 3rd Battalion , along with the 2 / 5th Battalion and the 6th Division Cavalry Regiment , were committed as reinforcements , to help bring the 7th Division up to strength . In a bitter campaign that lasted 28 days , <unk> French forces attempted to resist the Allied invasion , which had been launched in order to deny the Germans the use of <unk> territory to launch attacks against Egypt . Against a modest Allied force with only limited armour and artillery , the well @-@ equipped French force outnumbered the attackers and had the advantage of holding the mountainous terrain . Having contributed a company to garrison duties around Sidon in Lebanon , and provided 100 men to help re @-@ form the shattered 2 / 1st Battalion , the 2 / 3rd was <unk> – consisting of only 21 officers and 385 other ranks – when it entrained at <unk> in Palestine on 18 June 1941 to join the campaign . 
 Initially , after arriving from Palestine , the battalion was committed to forming a block on the road between Damascus and <unk> ; they were later committed to an attack to <unk> the Beirut road around <unk> , as part of wider fighting around Damascus on 20 – 22 June . Operating with British and Indian forces on the right flank , they then launched an unsuccessful action at <unk> Mazar on 24 – 28 June , where they were tasked with capturing the high ground overlooking the main road , along which the Australians were advancing . The battalion came under command of the re @-@ formed 17th Brigade , which was reconstituted to bring the 7th Division up to full strength as it operated along the coast . Despite being well below strength – consisting of just two companies with a total of 300 men – it joined the fighting at <unk> on 6 – 10 July , advancing along the <unk> River and leading the 17th Brigade 's advance . Despite heavy fighting the Allied forces slowly advanced simultaneously along the coast and inland , finally overcoming the <unk> French defences . Following the armistice on 14 July , the troops remained in Syria until January 1942 preparing defences and undertaking other garrison duties . The battalion 's casualties during the short campaign amounted to 16 killed and 77 wounded . 
 Following Japan 's entry into the war in December 1941 the decision was made to bring the 6th Division back to bolster the Allied defences in the Pacific , and the 2 / 3rd Battalion left the Middle East on 10 March 1942 , aboard the steamer <unk> . The original intention was that they would be sent to reinforce Java ; however , while they were at sea concerns about a Japanese attack on Ceylon ( now Sri Lanka ) prompted the diversion of the 16th and 17th Brigades to Colombo , and they arrived there on 21 March . The freighter Ben <unk> , carrying the battalion 's vehicles , arrived shortly afterwards and the 2 / 3rd took up defensive positions in the southeast part of the island , which was considered to be the most likely location for a Japanese invasion force to land . 
 On 5 April , a Japanese naval force sortied from the recently captured <unk> Islands and launched a series of attacks by carrier @-@ based aircraft on Colombo and <unk> . Another attack occurred on 9 April . Little damage was done on land , but both the British and Australian navies suffered losses . Regardless , the Japanese failed to sustain their initial momentum and the expected invasion did not occur . Nevertheless , men from the 2 / 3rd Battalion were kept busy for the remainder of their time preparing defences , manning anti @-@ aircraft positions and undertaking jungle training , while receiving instruction in lessons learned from operations in Malaya and Singapore . The men were taught how to use the jungle according to author Paul Ham " ... to ' melt ' into the foliage ; to <unk> their steps at night ; to use camouflage properly ; to detect human presence by crushed twigs and disturbed leaf mould ; to move silently over <unk> . To build shelters ; and to <unk> human from animal sounds . " 
 In July , British forces were sent from India to relieve the Australian troops in Ceylon . Preparations were made for the 2 / 3rd Battalion to return to Australia , and after embarking upon the SS <unk> , they arrived in Melbourne on 8 August 1942 , having returned via the southern route away from the Japanese submarines patrolling the east coast . After this , the troops all received two weeks home leave , <unk> from the time of their arrival . The final group had their leave cut short after only three days , however , when they were recalled by urgent telegram . The 16th Brigade was again on the move , this time to Port Moresby in New Guinea , where the fighting against the Japanese along the <unk> Track was reaching a critical stage . After a short voyage , the brigade arrived at Port Moresby on 21 September 1942 . 
 Following their arrival at Port Moresby , the 16th Brigade along with the 25th Brigade , prepared to relieve the forces on the <unk> Track . With the Australians having finally halted the Japanese advance , the fresh troops would be tasked with launching a counterattack to drive the Japanese back to <unk> in the north . Consequently , throughout October , November and into December , the 2 / 3rd Battalion took part in three major actions : <unk> Creek ( 22 – 28 October ) , <unk> ( 5 – 12 November ) , and an action on the <unk> Track ( 21 November – 19 December ) . 
 On 3 October , General Douglas MacArthur spoke to the 16th Brigade 's commander , Brigadier John Lloyd , at <unk> 's Corner , at the foot of the <unk> Track : " Lloyd , by some act of God your Brigade has been chosen for this job . The eyes of the Western world are upon you . I have every confidence in you and your men . Good luck and don 't stop . " The 16th Brigade arrived at <unk> 's Crossing on 19 October , just three days behind the 2 / 25th and 2 / 33rd Battalions , whom they relieved . The following day the 16th Brigade continued the advance but found that the Japanese had withdrawn to <unk> Creek , where they had established a strong defensive position . 
 Here the Japanese held the high ground in well @-@ concealed positions that had clear fields of fire into the narrow <unk> below . With no other options , the 16th Brigade was forced to assault the Japanese defences <unk> , advancing straight up the <unk> . <unk> torrential rain and stiff defence , progress was slow as each defensive position had to be dealt with individually . As the water level in the creek rose steadily , the troops came under heavy mortar fire and were attacked with grenades <unk> from the heights above . The supply situation grew desperate too , but by 28 October the 2 / 3rd Battalion had managed to work its way around the Japanese right flank in preparation for an attack . In the afternoon , the battalion launched its attack , breaking through the Japanese outposts and into the main position . The defenders were overwhelmed and many of them abandoned their weapons as they fled . That night , the remaining Japanese withdrew from the position . The 16th Brigade lost 72 killed and 154 wounded in this action . 
 Despite the successful action , the superiors of the 7th Division 's commander , Major @-@ General Arthur Allen , were dissatisfied by the counter @-@ offensive 's rate of progress , and he was relieved of his command the day before the Australian forces won through at <unk> Creek . Japanese resistance decreased after that battle , and by 31 September the 16th Brigade was advancing along the eastern fork of the Track through <unk> without opposition . On 2 November they passed through the recently abandoned village of <unk> . Three days later , as the Australians advanced towards the <unk> River , the 2 / 3rd Battalion went into battle at <unk> , after coming up against an entrenched force holding the high ground from <unk> to <unk> . The Japanese counter @-@ attacked the next day , and as fighting continued through to 6 November , Major General George <unk> , the new divisional commander , sent the 25th Brigade and the 2 / 1st Battalion on a successful attack against the Japanese rear at <unk> . The Japanese at <unk> , their supply and withdrawal route cut , were then forced to retreat . 
 The 2 / 3rd Battalion 's final involvement in the campaign came as the 16th Brigade advanced towards <unk> in November . They left the <unk> area on 16 November , with the battalion second in order of march . <unk> and drained from the <unk> of the last two months , the advance across the swamps of the coastal plain proved heavy work . On the first day they made 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) , but after heavy rains the following day and failures in the resupply effort , a large number of men fell behind due to exhaustion . On 19 November , the 2 / 3rd spearheaded the brigade 's advance to the coast . Several Japanese stragglers were taken prisoner and a number of minor contacts followed , but the Japanese defenders withdrew before the Australians could shake out to conduct an assault . 
 The following morning , the brigade reached the junction of the <unk> and Cape <unk> trails , about 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) from the coast . After the 2 / 1st Battalion was attacked , the 2 / 3rd Battalion took part in a brigade flanking attack around the Japanese position to the right , forcing the Japanese to fall back . The action , however , had severely depleted the brigade to the point where , with less than 1 @,@ 000 fit men , it was unable to continue offensive operations . Thereafter activity was limited to patrolling and maintaining a defensive perimeter . In early December the 16th Brigade was relieved by the 30th Brigade . The 2 / 3rd Battalion itself was relieved on 6 December , returning to <unk> with a strength of just six officers and 67 other ranks , before being evacuated back to Port Moresby by plane on 23 December 1942 . They were returned to Australia shortly afterwards for leave and to <unk> . During the fighting along the <unk> Track and the advance north to the sea , the 2 / 3rd lost 69 men killed and 103 wounded . 
 After a short period of leave the 6th Division came together again in late January 1943 on the Atherton <unk> to begin training , and to convert to the more austere jungle establishment . Under this structure , the size of the battalion was reduced by one officer and 106 other ranks , giving the 2 / 3rd Battalion a total of <unk> men of all ranks . At this time , a camp was built from scratch at <unk> , but it was 12 months before the battalion 's ranks were brought to full strength by the return of sick and wounded soldiers . As the battalion began to reform , some who had performed well in the preceding campaigns were recommended for commissioning and were sent to an Officer Training Unit at <unk> , in South Australia . Along with training there was time for recreation including swimming carnivals , boxing tournaments and a 6th Division rugby league championship in which the 2 / 3rd Battalion was victorious , beating the 2 / 3rd Machine Gun Battalion in the final . The team captain , <unk> <unk> , later went on to play for and captain the Wallabies . 
 During this time the battalion received a number of reinforcements from its associated Militia unit , the 3rd Battalion ( The <unk> Regiment ) . This unit had been fighting in New Guinea as part of the 30th Brigade , with whom it had served on the <unk> Track alongside the 2 / 3rd as well as the 39th and 49th Battalions , before being returned to Australia , where it had been disbanded . Other reinforcements also arrived from the 16th Battalion . 
 Due to a combination of political and strategic decisions , it was almost two years before the battalion went into combat again . In late 1944 , in order to free up American troops for operations in the Philippines , Australian forces were directed to take over responsibility for operations around Aitape in New Guinea . The 6th Division returned to New Guinea in November 1944 , with the final brigade arriving on 31 December 1944 . Although basically cut off from resupply , there were around 35 @,@ 000 Japanese troops in the area , holding the coast past <unk> and into the interior . <unk> by food supplies from native gardens in the <unk> Mountains , the Japanese put up heavy resistance to the Australians ' primary tactic of aggressive patrolling . 
 <unk> with reducing the Japanese , while remaining available to support operations elsewhere , the 6th Division began a limited offensive in the <unk> area . The 16th Brigade was initially held in divisional reserve , occupying a defensive position west of the <unk> River , until in February 1945 it was tasked with securing a forward supply base near <unk> Bay and clearing up to the <unk> River , about 8 miles ( 13 km ) to the east of the river . They came up against only minor opposition and by 23 February they had crossed the <unk> ; less than a month later they had progressed 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) east , occupying the coastal town of But and removing the Japanese from the <unk> area . 
 During this time , contact with the Japanese was limited to small @-@ scale actions rather than a large general action ; nevertheless , these actions caused heavy casualties as the Japanese defended stubbornly . Casualties amongst the Australians were , according to author <unk> <unk> , " heavy in relation to the size of ... the numerous small actions the Japanese forced them to fight " . In addition , the strenuous nature of the campaign reduced the troops ' resistance and ability to undertake proper medical precautions and as a result there were large numbers of sickness casualties . <unk> took a particularly heavy toll , with troops being affected by a particularly strong strain that proved resistant to the normal doses of <unk> . <unk> also resulted in losses . In one incident , seven men from the 2 / 3rd drowned when the <unk> River flooded amidst a torrential <unk> . 
 <unk> was captured on 10 May 1945 , and the 16th Brigade began pursuing the Japanese defenders that had withdrawn inland . They continued until 11 August , when offensive operations ceased after word was received that the Japanese had entered into ceasefire talks . The battalion was in the Mount <unk> area on 15 August when news came that the Japanese had surrendered following the atomic bombing of <unk> and <unk> . The battalion 's losses during its final campaign were 51 killed and 76 wounded . 
 After the cessation of hostilities , the battalion remained in the Aitape – <unk> area undertaking occupation duties . Its strength was slowly reduced as personnel were repatriated to Australia for <unk> or transferred to other units for further service . Eventually , the remaining cadre of personnel returned to Australia , and on 8 February 1946 the 2 / 3rd Battalion disbanded in Brisbane , as one of the most decorated battalions of the 2nd AIF . They had fought all the major Axis powers : the Italians , Germans , <unk> French and Japanese . Alongside the Australian 2 / 5th Battalion , they were the only Allied troops able to make this claim . During its service a total of 3 @,@ <unk> men served with the 2 / 3rd Battalion of whom 203 were killed and 432 wounded . Members of the 2 / 3rd received four Distinguished Service Orders , 16 Military Crosses , 12 Distinguished Conduct Medals , 30 Military Medals , two British Empire Medals and 73 <unk> in <unk> . 
 Cyclone <unk> was the strongest tropical cyclone of the 2006 North Indian Ocean cyclone season . In mid @-@ April , an area of disturbed weather formed over the southern Bay of Bengal and nearby <unk> Sea . Over a period of several days , the system became increasingly organized and was classified as a depression on April 24 . Situated within a region of weak steering currents , the storm slowly intensified as it drifted in a general northward direction . It attained gale @-@ force winds and was named <unk> the next day . Conditions for strengthening improved markedly on April 27 and <unk> subsequently underwent rapid intensification which culminated in the cyclone attaining its peak . Early on April 28 , the cyclone had estimated winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) . The Joint Typhoon Warning Center considered <unk> to have been slightly stronger , classifying it as a Category 4 @-@ equivalent cyclone . <unk> weakening ensued thereafter and the storm made landfall in <unk> 's <unk> State on April 29 . Rapid <unk> took place once onshore and <unk> was last noted early the next morning . 
 In contrast to <unk> 's intensity , damage was relatively minimal across <unk> due to adequate early warnings , while timely and effective <unk> <unk> loss of life along the coast . The greatest damage resulted from a thunderstorm near <unk> on April 28 that spawned a possible tornado in an industrial zone . A total of <unk> homes were damaged there . Just outside the city in the <unk> District , a flash flood killed at least 18 people . Overall , the storm claimed 37 lives in the country and left US $ 6 @.@ 7 million in damage . In the wake of <unk> , the Red Cross distributed relief aid to affected residents while local officials set up shelters to house those left homeless . Government and social organizations donated 5 @.@ 4 million <unk> ( US $ 4 @,@ 320 ) in cash to survivors in the <unk> Region . 
 <unk> at this time anticipated little intensification as the system was expected to move into a region of higher shear . However , on April 27 , the system moved under a subtropical ridge and conditions quickly became favorable for intensification . The presence of the ridge greatly enhanced the outflow over the cyclone and an eye developed by 1200 UTC . By this time , both the JTWC and <unk> estimated <unk> to have attained hurricane @-@ force winds with the latter classifying it as a very severe cyclonic storm . The previously weak steering currents became more established as well , with the storm now tracking northeast toward <unk> through a weakness in a ridge over Southeast Asia . Situated in an area with sea surface temperatures of 28 to 29 ° C ( 82 to 84 ° F ) , the cyclone was able to undergo rapid intensification as wind shear abruptly diminished . The <unk> estimated <unk> to have reached its peak intensity at <unk> UTC on April 28 with winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) and a barometric pressure of <unk> mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 17 inHg ) . Using the Dvorak technique , a method of determining a tropical cyclone 's strength via satellite imagery , the agency gave <unk> a rating of T # 5 @.@ 5 which yields an intensity of 189 km / h ( 117 mph ) . 
 The JTWC estimated <unk> to have been a stronger system , with peak winds of 220 km / h ( 140 mph ) and a pressure of 922 mb ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 23 inHg ) — equivalent to a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . Their Dvorak values peaked at T # 6 @.@ 5 or 235 km / h ( 146 mph ) . As the powerful storm approached <unk> , the combined effects of increasing wind shear and land interaction soon took their toll on <unk> . At <unk> UTC on April 29 , <unk> made landfall just south of <unk> in <unk> 's <unk> State as a very severe cyclonic storm . The JTWC estimated winds at this time to have been 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) . Rapid weakening ensued once the cyclone moved onshore . Within 12 hours of landfall , <unk> weakened to a deep depression and was last noted as a dissipating system earl on April 30 . 
 Sea surface temperatures in the wake of Cyclone <unk> decreased up to 4 – 5 ° C ( 7 – 9 ° F ) due to <unk> . From April 28 – 29 , the low @-@ level inflow associated affected much of the northern Bay of Bengal and resulted in northwesterly winds as far away as Hyderabad , India . These winds brought dry , dust filled air over the bay with mean particulate @-@ matter doubling over the region . 
 On April 26 , the local Department of Meteorology and <unk> in <unk> stated that the <unk> , <unk> Region , and <unk> regions were likely to be affected within two days and <unk> State within three days . Officials began broadcasting storm warning to the public over radio the following day . <unk> of at @-@ risk coastal areas were conducted , though specifics are unknown . Once the storm moved inland , residents across the country were advised of the likelihood of widespread heavy rain from the remnant system . 
 Despite never being forecast to strike Bangladesh , officials there warned residents that the storm could strike the nation and cause loss of life . Cautionary signals were raised at ports in <unk> , Cox 's <unk> , and <unk> , advising <unk> vessels to remain docked until the storm 's passage . Roughly 34 @,@ 000 members of the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society were placed on standby for possible relief efforts . 
 Flash flood warnings were issued across northern Thailand on April 29 under the threat of heavy rains from <unk> 's remnants . 
 Throughout almost the entire existence of <unk> , it produced rainfall in the <unk> and <unk> islands . Daily totals peaked on April 27 at 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) in Car <unk> . 
 After moving through <unk> , <unk> brought heavy rains to northern Thailand . According to local <unk> the storm also accelerated the onset of the seasonal monsoon which would contribute to a wetter @-@ than @-@ average year for the region . 
 Though <unk> struck <unk> as a powerful cyclone , early warnings and proper <unk> <unk> loss of life along coastal areas . Additionally , no major storm surge was reported , limiting the potential for major damage . The most significant effects were caused inland from torrential rains rather than at the coast . Overall , the storm claimed 37 lives and left 1 @.@ 24 billion <unk> ( US $ 6 @.@ 7 million ) in damage . Approximately 12 @,@ 000 families were significantly affected by the cyclone . 
 <unk> State suffered a direct hit from the cyclone , with <unk> Township reporting the worst damage . There , 88 homes were destroyed and 1 @,@ <unk> more were damaged . One person was killed and at least four others were injured in the township . Ra <unk> <unk> <unk> village suffered significant losses as well , with 132 homes destroyed and <unk> more damaged . A storm surge of 4 @.@ 57 m ( 15 @.@ 0 ft ) struck the region , but did not impact populated areas . 
 Across the <unk> Delta , hurricane @-@ force winds caused extensive damage to housing and infrastructure . <unk> Island was the first area struck by the storm . Several homes were destroyed and many more lost their roof there . <unk> from the storm 's outer bands on April 28 damaged <unk> homes in <unk> Township . Residents described what appeared to be a tornado as the cause of the damage . The <unk> industrial zone was hardest hit , with five factories destroyed and dozens of homes having their roof torn off . <unk> , however , claimed that the damage was more severe than reported by the government . Cars were reportedly tossed into the air during the storm . Two people were killed and fourteen others were injured in <unk> . The winds also downed numerous power lines , leaving many without electricity . In <unk> Township , near the southern tip of the Delta , 88 homes were destroyed . In the <unk> District , torrential rains caused flash flooding that killed 18 people and left 14 others missing . 
 George Washington Johnson ( May 27 , 1811 – April 8 , 1862 ) was the first Confederate governor of Kentucky . A lawyer @-@ turned @-@ farmer from Scott County , Kentucky , Johnson favored <unk> as a means of preventing the Civil War , believing the Union and Confederacy would be forces of equal strength , each too wary to attack the other . As political sentiment in the Commonwealth took a <unk> Union turn following the elections of 1861 , Johnson was instrumental in organizing a sovereignty convention in <unk> , Kentucky with the intent of " <unk> forever our connection with the Federal Government . " The convention created a Confederate shadow government for the Commonwealth , and Johnson was elected its governor . 
 Despite his <unk> political experience — having previously served only three years in the Kentucky House of Representatives — Johnson <unk> vehemently to ensure the success of the shadow government . Kentucky was admitted to the Confederacy on December 10 , 1861 , but the shadow government 's influence in the Commonwealth extended only as far as the Confederate Army advanced . When Albert Sidney Johnston abandoned the Confederate capital of <unk> Green , Governor Johnson and the other government officials accompanied him . Despite his advanced age and a crippled arm , Johnson volunteered for military service in General Johnston 's army . Johnson was killed at the Battle of <unk> , making him the only state governor , Union or Confederate , to fall in battle during the Civil War . He was succeeded by Richard <unk> , the second and last governor of Confederate Kentucky . 
 George Washington Johnson was born on May 27 , 1811 near Georgetown in Scott County , Kentucky , the son of major William and <unk> Payne Johnson . Major Johnson died soon after the close of the War of 1812 , in which he was a participant , and George Johnson was reared in the home of his stepfather , John Allen . Johnson received three degrees from Transylvania University : an <unk> in 1829 , an <unk> in 1832 , and an <unk> in 1833 . On August 20 , 1833 , he married Ann Eliza <unk> , daughter of Captain <unk> and Lydia Smith <unk> . The couple had ten children , seven of whom lived to adulthood . 
 Johnson briefly practiced law in Georgetown , but decided he preferred farming . He owned a 300 @-@ acre ( 1 @.@ 2 km2 ) farm near Georgetown , as well as a 1 @,@ 000 @-@ acre ( 4 @.@ 0 km2 ) plantation in Arkansas . In 1838 , Johnson was elected as a Democrat to the Kentucky House of Representatives . He was offered the nominations for lieutenant governor and U.S. Congressman , but declined them both . In August 1845 , Johnson headed the Committee of Sixty that seized abolitionist <unk> M. Clay 's printing press and shipped it to Cincinnati , Ohio . 
 Although he supported John C. <unk> for president in 1860 , he did not feel that Abraham Lincoln 's election justified <unk> , since Republicans controlled neither Congress nor the Supreme Court . As the Confederate States of America were formed , however , Johnson began to lose hope for Kentucky as a part of the Union . Instead , he began to advocate that Kentucky join the Confederacy , believing that the Union and Confederate nations would be too evenly matched to consider war and would negotiate a free trade agreement that would benefit both . 
 In 1861 , Johnson traveled to Richmond , Virginia to ask Jefferson Davis to respect Kentucky 's neutrality in the Civil War . Following a near sweep of Kentucky 's state and federal elections by Union sympathizers , William " Bull " Nelson established Camp Dick Robinson , a Union recruiting camp , in <unk> County . Southern sympathizers saw this as a breach of the Commonwealth 's neutrality , and called a State Rights Convention on September 10 , 1861 . Johnson was among the delegates from seventy Kentucky counties who attended the convention . The delegates elected Richard <unk> as chair , called for a restoration of Kentucky 's neutrality in the war , and condemned the Federal government for its " invasion . " This last @-@ minute effort to prevent Kentucky from aiding the Union was unsuccessful , and Johnson , a known Southern <unk> , fled to Virginia with <unk> and others to avoid potential arrest by Union forces . From Virginia , Johnson traveled through Tennessee to <unk> Green where , despite his age ( 49 ) and a crippled arm , he volunteered as an aid to General Simon B. <unk> . 
 On October 29 , 1861 , a group of <unk> — Johnson among them — met at <unk> , Kentucky to discuss the formation of a Confederate government for the Commonwealth , believing the Unionist government in Frankfort did not represent the will of the majority of Kentucky 's citizens . Johnson chaired the committee that authored the convention 's final report , and personally introduced some of its key resolutions . The report called for a sovereignty convention to <unk> ties with the Federal government . Johnson , <unk> , and Humphrey Marshall were among the notable members of the Committee of Ten that made arrangements for the convention . 
 On November 18 , 1861 , 116 delegates representing 68 Kentucky counties convened at the Clark House in <unk> . Over the next three days , a shadow government was established with <unk> Green as its temporary capital . Johnson was unanimously chosen as governor of the new Confederate state . 
 On November 21 , 1861 , Johnson wrote Confederate president Jefferson Davis to request Kentucky 's admission to the Confederacy . Though Davis had some reservation about the <unk> of the elected General Assembly in forming the Confederate government , he concluded that Johnson 's request had merit . Kentucky was admitted to the Confederacy on December 10 , 1861 . 
 During the winter of 1861 , Johnson tried <unk> to assert the legitimacy of the fledgling government , but to no <unk> . Its jurisdiction extended only as far as the area controlled by the Confederate Army . Johnson came <unk> short of raising the 46 @,@ 000 troops requested by the Confederate Congress in Richmond . Efforts to levy taxes and to <unk> citizens to turn over their guns to the government were similarly unsuccessful . On January 3 , 1862 , Johnson requested a sum of $ 3 million from the Confederate Congress to meet the provisional government 's operating expenses . The Congress instead approved a sum of $ 2 million , the expenditure of which required approval of Secretary of War Judah P. Benjamin and President Davis . 
 During his <unk> to sustain the provisional government , Johnson 's lack of hearing from his family weighed heavily upon him . The only family member with whom he had contact was his son Madison ( " <unk> " ) , who had joined John Hunt Morgan 's cavalry . Johnson admired and respected Morgan , and was pleased that his son had chosen to serve under him . In 1862 , he requested by letter that his wife send their fifteen @-@ year @-@ old son <unk> to serve in the Confederate Army . Despite Johnson 's <unk> that he would ensure his son 's safety , his wife refused this request . 
 It was Johnson 's practice to avoid interference with military decisions , however he supported Morgan 's request for two light artillery pieces that became <unk> of his command . By contrast , he consistently opposed the command of General Lloyd <unk> , trying repeatedly but unsuccessfully to have him removed . It is unclear how much military influence Johnson wielded in his position as governor , though he enjoyed a <unk> relationship with most of the Confederate generals . 
 When General Albert Sydney Johnston was forced to withdraw his troops from <unk> Green in February 1862 , the Confederate state government moved with his army to Tennessee . On April 6 , 1862 , General Johnston attacked the Union army at <unk> , Tennessee . During this battle , Governor Johnson served as a volunteer aide to General <unk> and Colonel Robert P. <unk> . After his horse was killed out from under him , Johnson fought on foot with Company E of the Fourth Kentucky Infantry Regiment , and insisted on being sworn in as a private . He declared " I will take a good night 's rest and be ready for the fight tomorrow . " 
 The next day , Governor Johnson was seriously wounded in the right thigh and abdomen . He lay wounded on the battlefield until the next morning , when he was recognized by Union General Alexander <unk> <unk> . Johnson and <unk> had both attended the 1860 Democratic National Convention and were both <unk> . Johnson was taken aboard the Union hospital ship <unk> , where despite the <unk> of several <unk> , he died on April 8 . Friends in the Union army , including General John M. <unk> , packed Johnson 's body in salt and shipped it to Louisville , then on to Georgetown for burial . 
 Edwin ( Old English : <unk> ; c . <unk> – 12 October <unk> / <unk> ) , also known as <unk> or <unk> , was the King of <unk> and <unk> – which later became known as Northumbria – from about <unk> until his death . He converted to Christianity and was baptised in <unk> ; after he fell at the Battle of Hatfield Chase , he was venerated as a saint . 
 Edwin was installed as king of Northumbria , effectively confirming <unk> as <unk> : <unk> 's sons went into exile in Irish Dál Riata and <unk> . That Edwin was able to take power not only in his native <unk> but also in <unk> may have been due to his support from <unk> , to whom he may have remained subject during the early part of his reign . Edwin 's reign marks an <unk> of the otherwise consistent domination of Northumbria by the <unk> and has been seen as " contrary to the prevailing tendency " . 
 Edwin and <unk> of Kent were allies at this time , and Edwin arranged to marry <unk> 's sister <unk> . Bede notes that <unk> would agree to marry his sister to Edwin only if he converted to Christianity . The marriage of <unk> 's <unk> mother <unk> had resulted in the conversion of Kent and <unk> 's would do the same in Northumbria . 
 The routine of kingship in Edwin 's time involved regular , probably annual , wars with neighbours to obtain tribute , submission , and slaves . By Edwin 's death , it is likely that these annual wars , <unk> in the main , had extended the Northumbrian kingdoms from the <unk> and the <unk> north to the Southern <unk> and the <unk> . 
 The account of Edwin 's conversion offered by Bede turns on two events . The first , during Edwin 's exile , tells how Edwin 's life was saved by <unk> of York . The second , following his marriage to <unk> , was the attempted assassination at York , at Easter <unk> , by an agent of <unk> of Wessex . Edwin 's decision to allow the baptism of his daughter <unk> and his subsequent promise to adopt Christianity if his campaign against <unk> proved successful . Apart from these events , the general character of Bede 's account is one of an <unk> king , unwilling to take risks , unable to decide whether to convert or not . 
 Along with these events , the influence of Edwin 's half @-@ <unk> Queen cannot be ignored , and the letters which Bede <unk> , sent by Pope <unk> V to Edwin and <unk> , are unlikely to have been unique . Given that Kent was under Frankish influence , while Bede sees the mission as being " Roman " in origin , the Franks were equally interested in converting their fellow Germans and in extending their power and influence . Bede recounts Edwin 's baptism , and that of his chief men , on 12 April <unk> . Edwin 's zeal , so Bede says , led to <unk> 's son <unk> also converting . 
 The brief speech by the unnamed <unk> , a nobleman , has attracted much attention ; suggesting the " wisdom and <unk> of the Christian message " , it has inspired poets such as William <unk> and was called " the most poetic <unk> in Bede " : 
 The present life man , O king , seems to me , in comparison with that time which is unknown to us , like to the swift flight of a sparrow through the room wherein you sit at supper in winter amid your officers and ministers , with a good fire in the midst whilst the storms of rain and snow prevail abroad ; the sparrow , I say , flying in at one door and immediately out another , whilst he is within is safe from the <unk> but after a short space of fair weather he immediately <unk> out of your sight into the dark winter from which he has emerged . So this life of man appears for a short space but of what went before or what is to follow we are ignorant . If , therefore , this new doctrine contains something more certain , it seems <unk> to deserve to be followed . 
 “ It is told that at the time there was so much peace in Britannia , that whenever King Edwin ’ s power extended , as is said <unk> right up to today , even if a woman with a recently born child wanted to walk across the whole island , from sea to sea , she could do so without anyone <unk> her . ” 
 <unk> indicates that “ Bede ’ s decision to <unk> Edwin ’ s peace in <unk> terms offers ... a chilling insight into the levels of lawlessness accepted in eighth @-@ century England ” . Furthermore , a definition of “ peace ” is to be understood as “ freedom from robbery , rape , or violence ; security to travel at will and to literally ‘ go in peace . ’ ” 
 Edwin 's conversion and <unk> 's were reversed by their successors , and in the case of Northumbria the Roman <unk> appears to have had very little impact . Indeed , by <unk> British clergy from <unk> and elsewhere in Edwin 's realm , <unk> may have weakened the Church rather than strengthening it . Very few Roman clergy were present in <unk> 's time , only James the Deacon being known , so that the " conversion " can have been only superficial , extending little beyond the royal court . <unk> 's decision to flee Northumbria at Edwin 's death , unlike his <unk> James who remained in Northumbria for many years afterwards until his death , suggests that the conversion was not popular , and the senior Italian <unk> <unk> . 
 The first challenge to Edwin came soon after his marriage @-@ alliance with Kent , concluded at Canterbury in the summer of 625 . By offering his protection to lesser kings , such as the king of Wight , Edwin thwarted the ambitions of <unk> of Wessex . <unk> 's response was to send an assassin , as noted already . Edwin did not immediately respond to this insult , suggesting either that he felt unable to do so , or that Bede 's portrayal of him as a rather <unk> ruler is accurate . Following the failed assassination , as noted , Edwin committed himself to Christianity provided only that he was victorious against <unk> . 
 From about <unk> onwards , Edwin was the most powerful king among the Anglo @-@ Saxons , ruling <unk> , <unk> and much of eastern <unk> , the Isle of Man , and Anglesey . His alliance with Kent , the <unk> of Wessex , and his recent successes added to his power and authority . The <unk> , as Bede calls it , that Edwin possessed was later equated with the idea of a <unk> , a later concept invented by West Saxon kings in the 9th century . Put simply , success confirmed Edwin 's <unk> , and failure would <unk> it . 
 Edwin faced <unk> and <unk> at the Battle of Hatfield in the autumn of <unk> or <unk> and was defeated and killed . For a time his body was ( allegedly ) hidden in Sherwood Forest at a location that became the village of <unk> ( trans . Edwin 's resting place ) , his head being eventually buried at York and the rest of his body at Whitby . Of his two grown sons by <unk> of <unk> , <unk> died at Hatfield , and <unk> was captured by <unk> and killed some time afterwards . 
 After his death , Edwin came to be venerated as a saint by some , although his cult was eventually overshadowed by the ultimately more successful cult of Oswald , who was killed in <unk> . They met their deaths in battle against similar <unk> , the pagan <unk> and the British , thus allowing both of them to be perceived as martyrs ; however , Bede 's treatment of Oswald clearly demonstrates that he regarded him as an unambiguously <unk> figure , a status that he did not accord to Edwin . 
 " <unk> " is the eighth episode of the third season of the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files , and originally aired on the Fox network on November 17 , 1995 . Written by Charles Grant Craig and directed by Kim Manners , " <unk> " is a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story , unconnected to the series ' wider mythology . It earned a Nielsen rating of 10 @.@ 5 and was watched by 15 @.@ 90 million people on its initial broadcast . The episode received positive reviews . Both the emotional nature of the story and David Duchovny 's performance received positive critical attention . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . Mulder is a believer in the paranormal , while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to <unk> his work . In the installment , a little girl named Amy is kidnapped and imprisoned by a mentally unstable photographer . Mulder discovers a psychic connection between the recently kidnapped victim and Lucy , another girl kidnapped by the same man years ago . He attempts to use the connection to help solve the investigation , but discovers that the event may be too traumatic for Lucy to handle . 
 " <unk> " is the only X @-@ Files screenplay written by Craig , who exited the writing staff before the entry was produced . The extensive outdoor filming lead to several difficulties for the production crew . Amy was 12 years old in the original screenplay . The Fox network was concerned her situation was an uncomfortable parallel to the recent Polly <unk> case , resulting in her age being increased before filming could begin . Critics have complimented the thematic resonance of the kidnapping and its effect on Mulder . 
 In Seattle , photography assistant Carl Wade ( Michael <unk> ) photographs 15 @-@ year @-@ old Amy <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) for school picture day . He becomes obsessed with her following the event , eventually kidnapping her . Her younger sister is the only witness to the incident , which takes place in their bedroom in the middle of the night . At exactly the same time , fast food worker Lucy <unk> ( Tracey Ellis ) collapses with a <unk> . Agent Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) investigates Amy 's disappearance , drawn to the case because his younger sister was kidnapped in a similar situation . The investigation leads Mulder to Lucy , who was taken from her bedroom at age eight , twenty two years before , and held in a dark basement for five years before she escaped . 
 Mulder 's partner Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) suspects that Lucy may be connected to Amy 's disappearance , based on her long criminal record and the fact that her <unk> contained not only her blood type , but Amy 's as well . In her room at a halfway house , <unk> appear on Lucy 's face and she experiences temporary blindness — injuries identical to Amy 's , who is being tortured in the basement of Wade 's cabin . The two develop an <unk> psychic connection ; everything that happens to Amy physically also happens to Lucy . Mulder tries to convince Lucy that she can help them find Amy , but she is too afraid to assist . Scully informs Mulder of their new lead in the case , the school photography assistant Wade , who was recently fired under strange circumstances . Mulder is adamant that Lucy , who admits that Wade was the man who abducted her , is not part of the kidnapping , and snaps at Scully when she suggests that Samantha 's disappearance is causing him to become too involved with the case . 
 The investigation team receives a tip from a tow truck driver concerning Wade 's location , which corresponds to the area where Lucy was found years ago . They find Wade 's cabin in the woods near Easton , Washington , discovering Lucy in the basement with no clear indication of how or why she came there . Lucy begins to feel cold and wet ; Mulder <unk> that because of Lucy 's connection to Amy , she must be at the local river . Mulder and Scully rush there to find Wade attempting to drown Amy . Back with the police , Lucy begins to drown despite not even being near water . Mulder shoots Wade while Scully attempts to perform CPR on Amy , but because of the connection it <unk> Lucy instead . Amy lies on the <unk> , dead . Mulder continues to attempt CPR , despite Scully 's protests . 
 Suddenly , the process is reversed ; Amy recovers and Lucy dies . <unk> by Lucy 's sacrifice and his inability to save her , Mulder breaks down sobbing over her body . He later tells Scully he suspects that she died not only to save Amy , but to forget what Wade did to her all those years ago . 
 The screenplay for " <unk> " was authored by Charles Grant Craig , a writer who at the time had little background or experience within television . Before joining the writing staff of The X @-@ Files during the third season , his most significant writing credits included episodes for <unk> and Booker . His most notable television screenplay was The New Alfred Hitchcock Presents entry " Final Escape " . Though Craig left the staff shortly before " <unk> " entered production for unknown reasons , he was credited as a supervising producer on several installments for the third season . The title was derived from the French word " <unk> " , which refers to a pit @-@ like dungeon consisting of " total darkness " with a hole that opens from the top . 
 The narrative centers on Mulder 's identification with Lucy which is based on the abduction of his sister , Samantha . It was decided that time would not be spent on Scully 's sympathy with the victim , despite her own abduction experience in the second season episode " Ascension " . Despite this , Scully is gentle towards Mulder and " wanted to believe " him until the evidence pointed overwhelmingly to Lucy . After that point , Scully takes on an antagonistic role , going against the wishes of her partner . Though not originally included the script , David Duchovny added the line about how his connection to the case was not just because of Samantha . 
 Series creator Chris Carter stated that in Craig 's original draft Lucy was more " hard @-@ boiled " , but actress Tracey Ellis played her as a more wounded person . Fox 's standards and practices department was uncomfortable with the screenplay , because it featured a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl being kidnapped . The network requested that she be in her late teens and that the plot would not heavily feature Amy 's ordeal or suffering . <unk> <unk> had just turned 13 when she was cast , but the producers felt she looked older and even applied make @-@ up to add to that effect . 
 The reason for the concern was because the original screenplay featured similarities to the Polly <unk> case , which had received large public attention around the time of production . Polly <unk> was a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl who was kidnapped during a <unk> party , and eventually <unk> to death . The antagonist of the episode was compared to Richard Allen Davis , the <unk> of the case , who was convicted and sentenced to death for his crimes . <unk> <unk> in his novel The Unofficial X @-@ Files Companion commented that " <unk> , unlike Amy , <unk> didn 't survive her abduction " . 
 " <unk> " was shot in Vancouver , British Columbia , as were the rest of the episodes of the third season . The location of the antagonist 's house was an important factor during production . Craig 's screenplay called for a remote house in the " middle of nowhere " , but the producers required a site closer to the studio . With a production crew consisting of 60 members , it was decided to use somewhere that could appear " <unk> while being next to a parking lot . " A suitable area was found near the peak of Mount Seymour , a location that had previously been used in " Ascension " . The mountain featured both a parking lot and a log cabin that met the needs of the filming crew . An issue arose because the mountain had a <unk> lift , which needed to be avoided while composing shots . Over 1000 prop trees had to be brought to the filming site to camouflage surroundings , to give the atmosphere a " remote " feel . 
 The crew encountered a larger issue with the contract with the Provincial Park committee . The park required a seven @-@ day notice before filming of any kind was approved . The production manager had to contact the park Representative directly , who assured him that their needs would be met . For the final sequence , both the <unk> River and Lynn <unk> were considered ; however , the Seymour River was ultimately chosen because it was the <unk> filming location . The filming of the episode was plagued by rain and heavy weather conditions . In one example , while directing the climax , the river had risen by four or five inches , causing the crew to move to another position to shoot at a week later . This cost the crew several days worth of production and a large sum of money . <unk> conditions were further complicated because shoots involving water are notably difficult , requiring a new set of costumes for each take . 
 Because of the extensive outdoor shooting , director Kim Manners hated directing the episode , commenting that " it couldn 't be fucking worse . " Despite a negative experience with shooting on the mountain , the episode " <unk> " from the fourth season was filmed there with similar issues . Gillian Anderson 's stand @-@ in Bonnie Hay , who appears in a cameo , previously played a doctor in both " Colony " and " End Game " and a nurse in " <unk> " . 
 The kidnapping of Amy shares several similarities with the abduction of Mulder 's sister . Mulder 's sister Samantha was abducted by aliens when Mulder was a child , before the timeline of The X @-@ Files . Both Amy and Lucy are kidnapped and <unk> by the same <unk> , who represents the " logic of <unk> " . Wade treats both girls in virtually identical ways , kidnapping them and photographing them <unk> in the same manner . David <unk> in <unk> All Knowledge asserts that Mulder is capable of seeing beyond " simple equivalents " , caring about each individual girl separately . <unk> argues that this grants Mulder the ability to separate the case from his own personal experience with his sister . The scene that best exemplifies this trait is when Mulder attempts to comfort Amy 's mother following her daughter 's kidnapping . Mulder comments that he " knows how she feels " , not because of what happened to his sister , but because he can identify with her general sense of loss . <unk> elements concerning the concept of " remote viewing " — the paranormal ability to perceive feelings from a distance — are later explored in greater detail in the fifth season installment " Mind 's Eye " . 
 " <unk> " was first broadcast on the Fox network on November 17 , 1995 . It earned a Nielsen rating of 10 @.@ 2 , with a 17 share , meaning that roughly 10 @.@ 2 percent of all television @-@ equipped households , and 17 percent of households watching television , were tuned in to the episode . It was watched by a total of 15 @.@ 90 million viewers . In the UK it premiered the following year on <unk> on October 17 , 1996 . 
 " <unk> " received mostly positive reviews from critics . Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club assessed it as a " B + " , commenting that it " belongs to a <unk> of X @-@ Files episodes that can often be more satisfying than the usual categories " due to the villain being a human being . He described it as " <unk> dark and occasionally moving " , and praised the cinematography , editing , and storytelling . However , he was critical of Ellis 's performance as Lucy , finding that her characterization did not fit the character , and he noted that the installment fell into the <unk> of using women as victims . Paula Vitaris from <unk> gave the program three and a half stars out of four . She felt that Mulder and Lucy 's relationship was " <unk> " and , in contrast to VanDerWerff , thought that Ellis 's performance was " perfect " . 
 Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated " <unk> " five stars out of five , noting that it was difficult and uncomfortable to watch with its parallels to the real world which made it " nevertheless one of the series ' <unk> and greatest achievements " . The two praised the depth of Mulder 's characterization as well as Duchovny 's performance . Entertainment Weekly gave " <unk> " a grade of " B- " , stating that the plot wasn 't as scary as it could have been considering the subject matter , positively <unk> that the episode was " worth it for Lucy 's channeling sequences " . The review also criticized Scully 's " aggressive I 'm @-@ not @-@ buying @-@ it mode " . 
 Writer Sarah <unk> awarded the entry five out of five , commenting that the subject matter made it hard for her to watch , as a mother herself . She praised the characterization of Mulder , and the performance by Duchovny , commenting that he brought warmth to the plot . <unk> positively described Mulder as " a truly gentle man who can show compassion without being <unk> about it " , but wrote negatively about Scully , who seemed " antagonistic " towards the well @-@ meaning Mulder , and the scene in which Scully " makes a half @-@ hearted attempt to <unk> [ Amy ] before giving up " . Duchovny was particularly pleased with his work in the episode , feeling that it was amongst his best acting performance during the entire run of The X @-@ Files . He later cited the episode as one of his favorites . 
 The 2000 Spanish Grand Prix ( formally the <unk> Gran <unk> <unk> de <unk> ) was a Formula One motor race held on 7 May 2000 at the Circuit de <unk> , <unk> , Barcelona , <unk> , Spain . It was the fifth round of the 2000 Formula One season and the 42nd Spanish Grand Prix . The 65 @-@ lap race was won by McLaren driver <unk> <unk> who started from the second position . His team @-@ mate David Coulthard finished second and Rubens <unk> finished third in a Ferrari . 
 Michael <unk> started from the pole position and held off a challenge from <unk> on the first lap . He maintained the lead until his first pit stop on lap 24 when a <unk> was struck by his rear tyre , allowing <unk> to take over the lead until his pit stop two laps later . Michael <unk> kept the lead for a further twenty @-@ one laps as he and <unk> made their second pit stops together , with <unk> emerging in front because <unk> experienced a slow pit stop . <unk> kept the lead for the remaining twenty @-@ three laps to win the race . 
 The victory was <unk> 's first of the season , and put him into second place in the World Drivers ' Championship , fourteen points behind Michael <unk> . Coulthard 's second @-@ place finish meant that he dropped to third , and <unk> third place moved him ahead of <unk> <unk> . In the World Constructors ' Championship , McLaren 's one @-@ two finish allowed them to move within seven points from leaders Ferrari . Williams remained in third on 15 points , with twelve races remaining in the season . 
 The Grand Prix was contested by eleven teams with two drivers each . The teams ( also known as constructors ) were McLaren , Ferrari , Jordan , Jaguar , Williams , <unk> , <unk> , Sauber , Arrows , <unk> and British American Racing ( <unk> ) . Tyre supplier Bridgestone brought two different tyre types to the race ; two dry compounds ( soft and medium ) . 
 After the British Grand Prix on 23 April , all teams conducted in @-@ season testing at the Circuit de <unk> on April 25 – 28 to prepare for the upcoming Spanish Grand Prix . Jos Verstappen was fastest on the first day of testing despite spinning into the gravel early in the session , ahead of McLaren test driver Olivier <unk> . Michael <unk> was quickest on the second day . Michael <unk> remained the fastest driver on the third day of testing . The session was disrupted because several drivers stopped on the circuit with problems with their cars . On the final day , ( which was held in wet weather conditions in the morning and during the end of the session ) Michael <unk> stayed the quickest driver on the final day . 
 <unk> driver Jacques <unk> was passed fit in the days leading up to the race . At the Brazilian Grand Prix , <unk> suffered back injury after his seat became loose during the race and the effects became worse and it caused him to withdraw from testing in Barcelona . He was also required to undergo <unk> . <unk> had their official test driver Darren Manning available to replace <unk> should the need arise . 
 The drivers took to the track at 09 : 30 <unk> ( UTC + 2 ) for a 30 @-@ minute warm @-@ up in cool and dry weather . Michael <unk> maintained his good performance , setting a time of 1 : 22 @.@ <unk> despite going into the gravel after <unk> too deep and also drove the spare Ferrari . <unk> was the second @-@ fastest driver ; <unk> was third and Coulthard rounded out the top four . After the session ended , Arrows withdrew their appeal after they accepted the FIA 's findings and de la Rosa was required to start at the back of the field . 
 The top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference . <unk> said that he was " pleased " to win the race and admitted that he waited until the pit stop phase to have any chance of <unk> Michael <unk> . The driver said that his team had more work to do on his car and was looking forward to the next race . Coulthard believed he made the right decision to compete in the Grand Prix despite his injuries and that the result was " the best thing that could have happened for the team and myself . " He also said he was looking forward to resting over the coming days to allow his injuries to heal . <unk> admitted that the race had not been good for him until his <unk> on Michael <unk> and <unk> <unk> and said the absence of <unk> caused his second pit stop to be slower than usual . 
 After the race , <unk> reduced the lead of Michael <unk> in the Drivers ' Championship to be seven points behind . Coulthard fell to third , two points behind Michael <unk> . <unk> moved up into fourth place on 13 points , and <unk> <unk> fell to fifth overall . In the Constructors ' Championship , Ferrari maintained their lead but McLaren 's one @-@ two finish moved to within seven points clear of the Italian team . Williams maintained third position with nine points . <unk> 's sixth @-@ place finish allowed Jordan to move point clear of <unk> in the battle for fourth , with twelve races remaining in the season . 
 The sculpture was commissioned by the Ladies ' Soldiers ' Memorial Association of <unk> , Rhode Island to honor those who served in the American Civil War . The funding for the sculpture came as the result of an 11 @-@ year fundraising campaign that was provided for by donations and entertainment events . The cost of the monument was stated to be $ 13 @,@ 000 by The New York Times , but report stated it to be $ 12 @,@ 000 . William Granville Hastings was chosen as the sculptor to execute the construction of the monument after winning a competition . The sculpture was cast by the <unk> Manufacturing Company . 
 The central feature of the monument depicts the theme of a young man called from civil life to serve his nation in a time of need and it transforms the theme into a contemporary allegory . It captures the decisive moment as farmer is caught mid @-@ transition , with his left hand still on the <unk> handle , and taking the sword with his right hand from Liberty . The details of the farmer includes realistic work clothes , a <unk> shirt with rolled sleeves and work trousers <unk> into his boots . Liberty , identified by her Phrygian cap , stands just above the farmer in classical robes with a <unk> , sandals and <unk> . Her face is <unk> as she <unk> the sword upon the farmer with her left hand while her right hand holds her <unk> . 
 <unk> the farmer and Liberty is a bronze plaque depicting a Union artillery battery under the command of General <unk> Burnside capturing a bridge in the Battle of Antietam . <unk> on the sides are two smaller triangular plaques which depict the female figures of History and Eternity . The Scribe of History , alternatively known as <unk> Poetry , is writing on a <unk> and Eternity both contemplates and is identified by a <unk> . The monument was dedicated on May 31 , 1897 , in ceremony conducted by the Grand Army of the Republic and an <unk> given by the Governor of Rhode Island , <unk> <unk> , Jr .. The statue is 11 feet ( 3 @.@ 4 m ) in height , and is mounted on a granite base 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) high and 22 feet ( 6 @.@ 7 m ) wide . 
 According to the National Register of Historic Places , Liberty <unk> the <unk> is historically significant as a " good representative of the character of early twentieth century <unk> sculpture " and the quality of its design . It is also historically significant for its association with the <unk> Manufacturing Company , a prominent Rhode Island producer of high quality <unk> and bronze <unk> . Though it is commemorative in intention , the statue is important " because it documents the principal effort of <unk> to honor those who served in the Civil War . " The sculpture was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2001 . 
 With a <unk> length of 50 to 56 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 to 2 @.@ 2 in ) in males and 46 to 53 mm ( 1 @.@ 8 to 2 @.@ 1 in ) in females , this is a medium @-@ sized bat . Its fur color is variable , ranging from reddish @-@ brown to gray , but it is generally darker than the species in the closely related genus <unk> which also occur on Madagascar . The skull contains a pronounced swelling around the nose and the second upper <unk> is displaced outside the <unk> . The maximum frequency of the <unk> call averages 94 @.@ 2 kHz and the species can easily be recognized on the basis of its call . 
 The species can easily be identified from recordings of its <unk> call . The call consists of a component with constant frequency followed by a short one with changing frequency . The call takes 6 @.@ 5 to 13 @.@ 5 <unk> , averaging 10 @.@ 1 <unk> , and the period between two calls is 22 @.@ 7 to 86 @.@ 3 <unk> , averaging 42 @.@ 7 <unk> . The maximum frequency averages 94 @.@ 2 kHz , the minimum frequency averages 82 @.@ 0 kHz , and the call emits the most energy at a frequency of 93 @.@ 2 kHz . 
 Under <unk> <unk> , the IUCN Red List lists this species as being of " Least Concern " , citing its common occurrence over a wide distribution and tolerance of human modifications of its habitat , even though its forest habitat is being destroyed in places . It has been recorded in numerous protected areas . <unk> , mainly the large <unk> <unk> , are sometimes hunted for food in southwestern Madagascar , and T. <unk> is also taken incidentally . 
 Henry le <unk> ( c . <unk> – <unk> ) was a 14th @-@ century English nobleman and Bishop of Norwich whose reputation as the ' Fighting Bishop ' was gained for his part in suppressing the <unk> ' <unk> in East <unk> and in defeating the peasants at the Battle of North <unk> in the summer of <unk> . 
 As a young man he studied at Oxford University and held numerous positions in the English Church . He fought in Italy before being consecrated as a bishop in <unk> . Parliament agreed to allow <unk> to lead a crusade to Flanders in <unk> , which was directed against Louis II of Flanders , a supporter of the <unk> Clement VII . The crusade was in defence of English economic and political interests . Although well funded , the expedition was poorly equipped and lacked proper military leadership . After initial successes , a disastrous attempt to <unk> the city of Ypres forced <unk> to return to England . Upon his return he was <unk> in parliament . His <unk> were confiscated by Richard II of England , but were returned in <unk> , the year he accompanied the king northward to repel a potential French invasion of Scotland . 
 <unk> was an energetic and able administrator who <unk> defended his diocese against <unk> . In <unk> , he was among those who stood by Richard , following the landing of Henry <unk> in Yorkshire towards the end of June . He was arrested for refusing to come to terms with <unk> . The following year , he was implicated in the Epiphany Rising , but was <unk> . 
 The le <unk> family originated from the lords of <unk> in north @-@ eastern France . Henry 's grandmother Eleanor de Clare was a granddaughter of Edward I of England . 
 In <unk> , <unk> 's nephew Thomas le <unk> , 1st Earl of Gloucester succeeded his father Edward . Thomas was captured and killed following the attempt to restore Richard II in the Epiphany Rising . 
 In <unk> ( as an eleven @-@ year @-@ old boy ) Henry ' de <unk> ' became the canon of Llandaff and a year later he was secured a <unk> of Salisbury Cathedral . By the age of nineteen he had become the rector of Bosworth and by February <unk> he was a master at Oxford University , studying civil law . He was ordained on 17 December <unk> . By 20 April <unk> he was archdeacon of Llandaff . Of his early life <unk> tells us that he spent some time in Italy fighting for Pope Urban V in his war against Milan in <unk> : 
 <unk> this same <unk> was <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> in <unk> , or the <unk> that he was <unk> 
 In <unk> <unk> , then the canon of Salisbury , was appointed as Bishop of Norwich by a papal bull dated 3 April <unk> . He was consecrated at Rome on 20 April and returned to England . He received the <unk> of his see from the Archbishop of Canterbury on 12 July <unk> and the <unk> from the king on 14 August . 
 During the <unk> ' <unk> of <unk> , rebels from Kent and Essex marched to London and , once admitted to the city , managed to capture the Tower of London . King Richard , who had promised to agree to all the demands of the peasants , met the rebels outside the city , where the leader of the peasants Wat Tyler was killed and the rebellion was ended . The king 's promises were <unk> . 
 The rebellion quickly spread to other parts of England , including the diocese of Norwich , where it lasted for less than a fortnight . On 14 June a group of rebels reached <unk> and from there the insurrection spread over south @-@ western Norfolk towards the <unk> . At the same time the rebels , led by a local <unk> , Geoffrey <unk> , moved across the north @-@ eastern part of the county , urging insurrection throughout the local area . Over the next few days , the rebels <unk> on Norwich , Lynn and <unk> . Norwich , then one of the largest and most important cities in the realm , was taken and occupied by <unk> and his followers , who caused considerable damage to the property and possessions of their enemies once they managed to enter the city . The Norwich rebels then travelled to Yarmouth , destroying legal records and landowners ' possessions ; other insurgents moving across north @-@ east Norfolk destroyed court rolls and taxation documents ; there were numerous incidents of <unk> and <unk> across the whole county . 
 Soon after Urban VI had been elected pope in <unk> , Robert of Geneva was elected as a rival pope , taking the name Pope Clement VII and removing himself to Avignon . The so @-@ called Western <unk> subsequently caused a great crisis in the Church and created rivalry and conflict throughout Christian Europe . It was eventually resolved as a result of the Council of Constance ( <unk> – <unk> ) . 
 In the autumn and winter of <unk> , Flanders had been invaded by Charles VI of France . Philip Van <unk> had fallen at the Battle of <unk> and the country had been compelled to submit to the French king , who obliged all the conquered towns to recognise Clement VII . In response to events in Flanders , Pope Urban issued bulls for the proclamation of a crusade , choosing Bishop <unk> to lead a campaign against the followers of Clement VII in Flanders . He granted <unk> extraordinary powers for the <unk> of his mission and <unk> indulgence to those who should take part in or contribute support to it . 
 Both the <unk> and King Richard II were enthusiastic about the launch of a crusade to Flanders , for political and economic reasons : revenues from the English wool staple ( that had ceased following the advance of the French ) could be resumed ; sending the bishop and not the king or his <unk> to Flanders would enable John of Gaunt 's unpopular plans for a royal crusade to <unk> to be abandoned ; French forces would be drawn away from the Iberian peninsula ; and Anglo @-@ Flemish relations would be strengthened . Another advantage in <unk> a crusade was that its cost would be borne by the Church and not by means of government <unk> : ever since the <unk> ' <unk> , the government was fearful of the consequences of imposing a tax to pay for a new war against the French . 
 On 6 December <unk> , Richard ordered the crusade to be published throughout England . Later that month the bishop and his men took the cross at St. Paul 's Cathedral . In February <unk> Parliament , after <unk> in <unk> the mission to a <unk> , ultimately assigned to him the subsidy which it had granted the king in the previous October for carrying on the war in Flanders . The king 's only <unk> was that the crusaders should await the arrival of William <unk> before launching offensive operations against the French and their allies . 
 The inhabitants of Ypres were well prepared for a siege by the time the English and their allies arrived and attacked the city on 8 June <unk> . <unk> in the outlying suburbs had been abandoned ; the timber from them was used to strengthen the earth <unk> and the stone gates of the city . A mission had been dispatched to Paris to replace artillery powder stocks . The city was well organised under the command of the <unk> of Ypres , John d <unk> , and had been divided into different defensive sectors . Although the <unk> were low , they were well protected with a double wet ditch , a high <unk> hedge reinforced with stakes and a wooden stockade and fire @-@ step . 
 The English attacked the Temple Gate on the first day but were beaten off . Over the next three days the city gates were attacked simultaneously , without success . Before the end of the first week of the siege , reinforcements arrived to completely encircle the city walls and the outer ditch was breached using soil . On the eighth day ( 15 June ) <unk> attacked the defences with artillery , firing on the <unk> Gate and damaging it , but not enough to cause the city defences to be breached . Over the following days of the siege , sustained artillery attacks had little overall effect and the assaults of <unk> 's troops were all beaten off . An attempt to drain the ditches seriously threatened the <unk> , but the attempt was unsuccessful and the besieged managed to communicate with the Duke of <unk> through Louis le <unk> , who was able to raise a large French army to come to the aid of the city . On 8 August , after eight weeks of effort , <unk> abruptly decided to abandon the siege , leaving his allies to continue on their own . 
 Soon after returning from Flanders , the bishop was <unk> in parliament , on 26 October <unk> , in the presence of the king . The chancellor Michael de la Pole accused him of not <unk> his troops at Calais , as had been agreed ; not recruiting a high enough number of armed men ; refusing to <unk> properly who his military leaders were ; <unk> the king by not allowing a secular lord to command the expedition to Flanders ; and disbanding his forces prematurely . <unk> denied all the charges , insisting that enough men had assembled at Ypres , that he had chosen his commanders well and that he had not refused to obey the king 's orders . After de la Pole declared the bishop 's replies to be insufficient , <unk> requested another hearing to defend himself still further , which was granted . In this hearing <unk> proceeded to blame his own commanders for forcing him to retreat from Ypres and then evacuate the garrisons . All his arguments were refuted and he was blamed for the failure of the expedition . His <unk> were confiscated and he was ordered to <unk> any costs taken from money gained from the French . 
 <unk> 's fall from grace did not last long . Following Scottish incursions into England , it was decided that the 18 @-@ year @-@ old King Richard should lead an army into Scotland , marking the start of his military career . In <unk> every magnate of consequence , including <unk> , joined the immense host that advanced north with the king , 
 " finding a country totally waste , where there was nothing to <unk> , and little that could even be destroyed , excepting here and there a tower , whose massive walls defied all means of destruction then known , or a cluster of <unk> <unk> .... " ' ( Sir Walter Scott , Scotland , vol . 1 ) . 
 The English army reached Edinburgh , which was sacked , but then retreated back to England , despite John of Gaunt 's wish to go on to Fife . The Scottish campaign was one of the last times that <unk> marched with an army . 
 Henry le <unk> continued to be controversial after his fighting career was over , mainly because of the vigorous methods he used to maintain control over the laity in his diocese and his own cathedral church . He defended the <unk> of the church against <unk> as <unk> as he defended his episcopal rights and privileges . 
 Since <unk> , there had been a growing fear of <unk> among the English political elite . The <unk> had first appeared in the <unk> and had briefly found favour with the upper classes , but in <unk> power was given for the authorities to <unk> heretics and examine them in a Church court . During the second half of his reign Richard II became steadily more determined to maintain religious <unk> and acted increasingly harshly to suppress the <unk> . His successor Henry IV went even further , introducing the death penalty for heresy and for possession of a <unk> . 
 <unk> took active steps to maintain <unk> in his own diocese . The chronicler Thomas <unk> praised Henry 's actions against the <unk> and contrasted him with his fellow bishops : 
 " He <unk> , <unk> , and did not <unk> of what he said , that if anyone belonging to that <unk> sect should <unk> to preach in his diocese , they should be taken to the fire or beheaded . Consequently , having understood this , no one belonging to that tendency had any desire to embrace <unk> , with the result that , up to now , the faith and true religion have remained unaffected within the bounds of his episcopal authority . " ( <unk> , Historia <unk> ) . 
 Henry was implicated in the abortive ‘ Epiphany Rising ' of January 1400 , during which his nephew Thomas , Earl of Gloucester played a key part and was subsequently executed . Thomas had been created Earl of Gloucester by Richard II , but in <unk> was accused of being involved in the death of the son of the Duke of Gloucester and as a result lost his <unk> . He joined in the conspiracy of the <unk> of <unk> , Kent and <unk> and was with their army at <unk> , when they were attacked by the <unk> , who burnt Thomas le <unk> 's lodgings . Thomas fled , boarding a ship , but the captain forced him to Bristol , where on 13 January he was released to the mob and beheaded at the high cross . 
 In the aftermath of the rebellion Henry le <unk> appointed John <unk> , the archdeacon of Norwich , as his vicar @-@ general on 5 February 1400 and then submitted himself to the custody of Archbishop Arundel who accompanied him to Parliament on 20 January <unk> . There his enemy Sir Thomas <unk> falsely accused him of being involved in the plot . He was finally reconciled to Henry IV when the king granted him a pardon in <unk> . 
 <unk> died on 23 August <unk> and was buried in Norwich Cathedral before the high altar . A brass inscription dedicated to him was placed there , but has since been destroyed . 
 <unk> <unk> is a species of fungus in the agaric family <unk> . Described as new to science in 2010 , the species is known only from subtropical and pine forests in Mexico , where it grows on rotting pine and oak wood . Fruit bodies ( mushrooms ) have red @-@ orange caps up to 3 @.@ 8 cm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) in diameter with a shape ranging from <unk> , convex , or flattened , depending on their age . The <unk> yellow stems are up to 4 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 8 in ) long . It is similar in appearance to <unk> <unk> , with which it shares an <unk> or scarlet @-@ colored cap and a yellow stem . P. <unk> can be distinguished from this and other superficially similar <unk> species by differences in microscopic characteristics . 
 The species was described by Olivia Rodríguez in 2010 in the journal <unk> , based on collections made in 1991 . The holotype material was collected on the Colima volcano , in the Municipality of <unk> el Grande , at an elevation of 2 @,@ 100 m ( 6 @,@ 900 ft ) . The species was formerly referred to <unk> <unk> , with which it bears a close resemblance . After close examination and comparison of the two species , the authors concluded that the differences in morphology and DNA sequence were sufficient to warrant describing a new species . 
 <unk> <unk> is very similar to P. <unk> in external appearance , and the two can only be reliably distinguished by microscopic characteristics or DNA sequence . In contrast to the latter species , the former has oblong spores , and cystidia that are shorter and less slender . P. <unk> is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere , but rare . 
 The species <unk> <unk> shares with P. <unk> a fragile fruit body , a red cap , and similar <unk> morphology . It differs in its orange @-@ red gill edges , red stem , and cap <unk> cells that contain pigment . Other species with a roughly similar appearance , including P. <unk> , P. <unk> , P. <unk> , P. <unk> , and P. <unk> , can be distinguished by differences in microscopic characteristics . 
 <unk> <unk> is known only from subtropical and pine forests in the states of Guerrero and <unk> , Mexico , where it grows on the rotting wood of pine and oak . It is one of 34 <unk> species known in Mexico . 
 Florence Madeline " <unk> " <unk> ( née Cave , 16 September 1881 – 9 September 1917 ) was a British figure <unk> . She became the first woman to compete at the World Figure <unk> Championships in 1902 by entering what was previously an all @-@ male event and won the silver medal , which prompted the International <unk> Union ( <unk> ) to create a separate ladies ' championship . <unk> was the winner of the first two ladies ' events in 1906 and 1907 , and went on to become the Olympic champion at the 1908 Summer Olympics , the first Olympic Games to include figure skating . She also competed as a pairs <unk> with her husband Edgar <unk> , winning the bronze medal at the 1908 Olympics . 
 Florence Madeline Cave was born on 16 September 1881 in Kensington , London , one of 15 children of Edward Jarvis Cave , a builder , and his wife Elizabeth Ann . She was a proficient figure <unk> , as well as a gifted swimmer and <unk> . <unk> became a regular at the Prince 's <unk> Club in <unk> , which had been formed in 1896 and was popular with aristocratic society in London . 
 In 1899 <unk> met her future husband Edgar <unk> , a figure <unk> and coach who was 18 years her senior . Edgar was an exponent of the international skating style , which was <unk> and less rigid than the traditional English style , and encouraged <unk> to adopt this style . <unk> and Edgar completed together in pairs skating events , and in 1900 finished second in one of the first international pairs events , staged in Berlin . They married in June of that year . The <unk> co @-@ authored The Book of Winter Sports in 1908 . 
 The World Figure <unk> Championships , first contested in 1896 , was regarded as an all @-@ male event since competitive skating was generally viewed as a male activity , but there was no regulation barring women , enabling <unk> to enter and compete at the 1902 Championships in London . She won the silver medal behind <unk> <unk> , who was <unk> so impressed with her challenge that he offered her his gold medal . T. D. Richardson later wrote : " <unk> , <unk> more than <unk> – a good deal of expert opinion – thought she should have won . " 
 <unk> ' entry into the World Championships prompted the <unk> to discuss the subject of women competing against men at their next Congress in 1903 . The concerns raised were that " ( 1 ) the dress prevents the judges from seeing the feet ; ( 2 ) a judge might judge a girl to whom he was attached ; and ( 3 ) it is difficult to compare women with men . " The Congress voted six to three in favour of barring women from the championships . 
 <unk> continued to compete elsewhere , and in 1903 won the inaugural British Figure <unk> Championships , which began as a mixed competition . She won again the following year , beating her husband , who won the silver medal . She also entered the 1904 European Championships but withdrew due to injury after the first stage of the competition , the compulsory figures . 
 The 1905 <unk> Congress established a separate ladies ' event , which was supported by strong lobbying from the National Ice <unk> Association . The event was known at the time as the Ladies ' Championship of the <unk> rather than a World Championship , and was staged at a different date and location from the men 's event . <unk> won the inaugural event held in <unk> , Switzerland in 1906 , finishing first in a field of five competitors . She won her second title in Vienna at the 1907 Championships . 
 The 1908 Summer Olympics in London were the first Games to include figure skating events in the programme , which were staged in October at the Prince 's Club . <unk> entered both the ladies ' event and the pairs with Edgar . In the ladies ' event , <unk> comfortably won the compulsory figures section , with all five judges placing her first . The official report of the Games described her as " in a class by herself " and stated that " the wonderful accuracy of her figures , combined with perfect carriage and movement , was the chief feature of the morning 's skating . " In the free skating , the report described her as having " excelled in rhythm and time @-@ keeping , and her dance steps , <unk> , & c . , were <unk> without a fault . " She was again placed first by all five judges and won the title . In the pairs event <unk> and Edgar finished third ( of three couples ) and won the bronze medal . 
 <unk> retired from competitive skating after the Olympics due to fading health . She and Edgar co @-@ authored a second book together , The Art of <unk> ( International Style ) , published in 1913 . She died of heart failure caused by acute <unk> on 9 September 1917 at her home in <unk> , Surrey , aged 35 . 
 The Senate of the Roman Republic was a political institution in the ancient Roman Republic . It was not an elected body , but one whose members were appointed by the <unk> , and later by the censors . After a Roman magistrate served his term in office , it usually was followed with automatic appointment to the Senate . According to the Greek historian <unk> , our principal source on the Constitution of the Roman Republic , the Roman Senate was the predominant branch of government . <unk> noted that it was the <unk> ( the highest @-@ ranking of the regular magistrates ) who led the armies and the civil government in Rome , and it was the Roman assemblies which had the ultimate authority over elections , legislation , and criminal trials . However , since the Senate controlled money , administration , and the details of foreign policy , it had the most control over day @-@ to @-@ day life . The power and authority of the Senate derived from precedent , the high caliber and prestige of the <unk> , and the Senate 's unbroken lineage , which dated back to the founding of the Republic in 509 BC . 
 Originally the chief @-@ magistrates , the <unk> , appointed all new <unk> . They also had the power to remove individuals from the Senate . Around the year <unk> BC , the " <unk> <unk> " ( <unk> <unk> ) gave this power to another Roman magistrate , the censor , who retained this power until the end of the Roman Republic . This law also required the censors to appoint any newly elected magistrate to the Senate . Thus , after this point in time , election to <unk> office resulted in automatic Senate membership . The appointment was for life , although the censor could <unk> any senator . 
 The rules and procedures of the Roman Senate were both complex and ancient . Many of these rules and procedures originated in the early years of the Republic , and were upheld over the centuries under the principle of <unk> <unk> ( " customs of the ancestors " ) . While Senate meetings could take place either inside or outside of the formal boundary of the city ( the <unk> ) , no meeting could take place more than a mile outside of the <unk> . Senate meetings might take place outside of the formal boundary of the city for several reasons . For example , the Senate might wish to meet with an individual , such as a foreign ambassador , whom they did not wish to allow inside the city . 
 At the beginning of the year , the first Senate meeting always took place at the Temple of Jupiter <unk> . Other venues could include the Temple of <unk> or the Temple of Concord , or , if the meeting was outside of the formal boundary of the city , at the Temple of Apollo or ( if a war meeting ) at the Temple of <unk> . In addition , the Senate operated while under various religious restrictions . For example , before any meeting could begin , a sacrifice to the gods was made , and a search for divine <unk> ( the auspices ) was taken . The auspices were taken in order to determine whether that particular Senate meeting held favor with the gods . The Senate was only allowed to meet in a building of religious significance , such as the <unk> <unk> . 
 The ethical requirements of <unk> were significant . Senators could not engage in banking or any form of public contract . They could not own a ship that was large enough to participate in foreign commerce , and they could not leave Italy without permission from the Senate . In addition , since they were not paid , individuals usually sought to become a senator only if they were independently wealthy . 
 The censors were the magistrates who enforced the ethical standards of the Senate . Whenever a censor punished a senator , they had to <unk> some specific failing . Possible reasons for punishing a member included corruption , abuse of capital punishment , or the disregard of a colleague 's veto , constitutional precedent , or the auspices . Senators who failed to obey various laws could also be punished . While punishment could include <unk> ( expulsion ) from the Senate , often a punishment was less severe than outright expulsion . While the standard was high for <unk> a member from the Senate , it was easier to deny a citizen the right to join the Senate . Various moral failings could result in one not being allowed to join the Senate , including bankruptcy , prostitution , or a prior history of having been a <unk> . One law ( the Lex <unk> of 123 BC ) made it illegal for a citizen to become a senator if they had been convicted of a criminal offense . Many of these laws were enacted in the last century of the Republic , as public corruption began reaching unprecedented levels . 
 Meetings usually began at dawn , although occasionally certain events ( such as festivals ) might delay the beginning of a meeting . A magistrate who wished to summon the Senate had to issue a compulsory order ( a <unk> ) , and <unk> could be punished if they failed to appear without reasonable cause . In 44 BC for example , consul Mark Antony threatened to <unk> the house of the former consul <unk> for this very reason . The Senate meetings were technically public because the doors were usually left open , which allowed people to look in , but only <unk> could speak . The Senate was directed by a presiding magistrate , who was usually either a consul ( the highest @-@ ranking magistrate ) or , if the consul was unavailable , a <unk> ( the second @-@ highest ranking magistrate ) . By the late Republic , another type of magistrate , a <unk> <unk> , would sometimes <unk> . 
 A senator could make a brief statement , discuss the matter in detail , or talk about an unrelated topic . All <unk> had to speak before a vote could be held , and since all meetings had to end by nightfall , a senator could talk a proposal to death ( a <unk> or <unk> <unk> ) if they could keep the debate going until nightfall . It is known , for example , that the senator <unk> the Younger once <unk> in an attempt to prevent the Senate from granting Julius Caesar a law that would have given land to the veterans of Pompey . 
 In the later years of the Republic , attempts were made by the aristocracy to limit the increasing level of chaos associated with the <unk> tendencies and democratic <unk> of some of the <unk> . Laws were enacted to prevent the inclusion of <unk> material in bills before the Senate . Other laws were enacted to outlaw the so @-@ called <unk> bills , which are bills , usually enacted by a single vote , that contain a large volume of often unrelated material . 
 Laws were also enacted to strengthen the requirement that three days pass between the proposal of a bill , and the vote on that bill . During his term as dictator , Julius Caesar enacted laws that required the publication of Senate resolutions . This publication , called the <unk> <unk> , or " daily proceedings " , was meant to increase transparency and minimize the potential for abuse . This publication was posted in the Roman <unk> , and then sent by messengers throughout the provinces . 
 Once a vote occurred , and a measure passed , he could do nothing , since his promise to physically <unk> his person against the <unk> was now meaningless . In addition , during a couple of instances between the end of the Second <unk> War in 201 BC and the beginning of the Social War in 91 BC , although they had no legal power to do so , several <unk> were known to have vetoed acts of the Senate . Ultimately , if there was no veto , and the matter was of minor importance , it could be voted on by a voice vote or by a show of hands . If there was no veto , and the matter was of a significant nature , there was usually a physical division of the house , where <unk> voted by taking a place on either side of the chamber . 
 Spokane ( pronunciation : / <unk> / <unk> @-@ <unk> ) is a city in the state of Washington , in the northwestern United States . Spokane is the seat of Spokane County . It is located on the Spokane River , west of the Rocky Mountain foothills in eastern Washington , 92 miles ( 148 km ) south of the Canadian border , approximately 20 miles ( 30 km ) from the Washington – Idaho border , and 280 miles ( 450 km ) east of Seattle along Interstate 90 . The city and wider Inland Northwest region is served by Spokane International Airport , 5 miles ( 8 km ) west of downtown Spokane . According to the 2010 Census , Spokane had a population of 208 @,@ <unk> , making it the second largest city in Washington and the <unk> largest city in the United States . 
 The first humans to live in the area , the Spokane people ( their name meaning " children of the sun " in <unk> ) , arrived between 13 @,@ 000 and 8 @,@ 000 years ago , living off plentiful game . Known as the birthplace of Father 's Day , Spokane is officially nicknamed the " <unk> City " . David Thompson explored the area with the westward expansion and establishment of the North West Company 's Spokane House in 1810 . This trading post was the first long @-@ term European settlement in Washington . <unk> of the Northern Pacific Railway in 1881 brought settlers to the Spokane area , and that same year it was officially incorporated as a city with the name " <unk> Falls " . The " e " was added to Spokane in 1883 , and " Falls " was dropped in 1891 . In the late 19th century , gold and silver were discovered in the Inland Northwest . The local economy depended on mining , timber , and agriculture until the 1980s . Spokane hosted the first environmentally themed World 's Fair at Expo ' 74 . 
 Many of the older Romanesque Revival @-@ style buildings in the downtown area were designed by architect <unk> <unk> <unk> after the Great Fire of 1889 . The city also features <unk> and <unk> parks , the Smithsonian @-@ affiliated Northwest Museum of Arts and Culture , the Davenport Hotel , and the Fox and Bing Crosby theaters . The Cathedral of Our Lady of Lourdes serves as the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Spokane with Thomas Daly as the newly appointed Bishop as of 2015 . The Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist ( Spokane , Washington ) represents the Anglican community . The city is also the center of the Mormon Spokane Washington Temple District . <unk> University was established in 1887 by the Society of Jesus , and the private Presbyterian Whitworth University moved to north Spokane in 1914 from <unk> , WA . In sports , the <unk> Bulldogs collegiate basketball team competes at the Division I level . Professional and semi @-@ professional sports teams include the Spokane Indians in Minor League Baseball , Spokane Empire in arena football , and Spokane Chiefs in junior ice hockey . As of 2010 , Spokane 's only major daily newspaper , The <unk> @-@ Review , had a daily circulation of over 75 @,@ 000 . 
 The first humans to live in the Spokane area arrived between 13 @,@ 000 and 8 @,@ 000 years ago and were hunter @-@ gatherer societies that lived off plentiful game . The Spokane tribe , after which the city is named ( the name meaning " children of the sun " <unk> ) , [ a ] are believed to be either their direct descendants , or descendants of people from the Great Plains . When asked by early white explorers , the <unk> said their ancestors came from " up North " . 
 Early in the 19th century , the Northwest Fur Company sent two white fur trappers west of the Rocky Mountains to search for fur . These were the first white men met by the <unk> , who believed they were sacred , and set the trappers up in the <unk> River valley for the winter . 
 The explorer @-@ geographer David Thompson , working as head of the North West Company 's Columbia Department , became the first European to explore the Inland Empire ( now called the Inland Northwest ) . Crossing what is now the U.S. – Canadian border from British Columbia , Thompson wanted to expand the North West Company further south in search of furs . After establishing the <unk> House and <unk> House trading posts in what are now Idaho and Montana , Thompson then attempted to expand further west . He sent out two trappers , Jacques Raphael <unk> and <unk> McDonald , to construct a fur trading post on the Spokane River in Washington and trade with the local Indians . This post was established in 1810 , at the confluence of the Little Spokane and Spokane rivers , becoming the first enduring European settlement of significance in Washington state . Known as the Spokane House , or simply " Spokane " , it was in operation from 1810 to 1826 . Operations were run by the British North West Company and later the Hudson 's Bay Company , and the post was the headquarters of the fur trade between the Rocky and Cascade mountains for 16 years . After the latter business absorbed the North West Company in 1821 , the major operations at the Spokane House were eventually shifted north to Fort <unk> , reducing the post 's significance . 
 In 1836 , Reverend Samuel Parker visited the area and reported that around 800 Native Americans were living in Spokane Falls . A medical mission was established by Marcus and <unk> Whitman to cater for <unk> Indians and <unk> of the Oregon Trail at <unk> Walla in the south . After the <unk> were killed by Indians in 1847 , Reverend Cushing <unk> established Whitman College in the city of <unk> Walla , WA in their memory . Rev. <unk> built the first church in Spokane in 1881 Between 1881 and 1882 the first Baptist and Episcopal churches were started , and the first Presbyterian church in 1883 . 
 In 1853 , two years after the establishment of the Washington Territory , the first governor , Isaac Stevens , made an initial effort to make a treaty with Chief Garry and the <unk> at Antoine <unk> ' Ferry , not far from <unk> . 
 After the last campaign of the <unk> Indian War , the <unk> d <unk> War of 1858 was brought to a close by the actions of Col. George Wright , who won decisive victories against a confederation of tribes in engagements at the battles of Four Lakes and Spokane Plains . The cessation of hostilities opened the inter @-@ mountain valley of the Pacific Northwest to safe habitation by settlers . 
 In 1880 , Fort Spokane was established by U.S. Army troops under Lt. Col. Henry Clay <unk> 56 miles ( 90 km ) northwest of Spokane , at the junction of the Columbia and Spokane Rivers , to protect the construction of the Northern Pacific Railway and secure a place for U.S. settlement . By June 30 , 1881 , the railway reached the city , bringing major European settlement to the area . The city of <unk> Falls ( the " e " was added in 1883 and " Falls " dropped in 1891 ) was officially incorporated as a city of about 1 @,@ 000 residents on November 29 , 1881 . [ c ] The marketing campaigns of transportation companies with affordable fertile land to sell along their trade routes lured many settlers into the region they dubbed " Spokane Country " . 
 The 1883 discovery of gold , silver , and lead in the <unk> d <unk> region of northern Idaho lured prospectors . The Inland Empire erupted with numerous mining rushes from 1883 to 1892 . <unk> and <unk> emerged as a major stimulus to Spokane . At the onset of the initial 1883 gold rush in the nearby <unk> d <unk> mining district , Spokane became popular with prospectors , offering low prices on everything " from a horse to a <unk> pan " . It would keep this status for subsequent rushes in the region due to its trade center status and accessibility to railroad infrastructure . [ d ] 
 Spokane 's growth continued unabated until August 4 , 1889 , when a fire , now known as The Great Fire ( not to be confused with the Great Fire of 1910 , which happened nearby ) , began just after 6 : 00 p.m. and destroyed the city 's downtown commercial district . Due to technical problems with a pump station , there was no water pressure in the city when the fire started . In a desperate bid to <unk> the fire , <unk> began <unk> buildings with dynamite . Eventually the winds and the fire died down ; 32 blocks of Spokane 's downtown core had been destroyed and one person killed . 
 Despite this catastrophe , and in part because of it , Spokane experienced a building boom . [ e ] The downtown was rebuilt , and the city was <unk> under the present name of " Spokane " in 1891 . According to historian David H. Stratton , " From the late 1890s to about 1912 , a great <unk> of construction created a modern urban profile of office buildings , banks , department stores , hotels and other commercial institutions , " which stretched from the Spokane River to the site of the Northern Pacific railroad tracks below the South Hill . Yet the rebuilding and development of the city was far from smooth : between 1889 and 1896 alone , all six bridges over the Spokane River were destroyed by floods before their completion . In the 1890s the city was subject to <unk> migration by African @-@ Americans from <unk> , looking for work after the closure of the area 's mines . Two African @-@ American churches , <unk> Baptist and Bethel African Methodist Episcopal , were founded in 1890 . Just three years after the fire , in 1892 , James J. Hill 's Great Northern Railway arrived in the chosen site for Hill 's rail yards , the newly created township of <unk> ( annexed by Spokane in 1924 ) . Spokane became an important rail shipping and transportation hub for the Inland Empire , connecting mines in the Silver Valley with agricultural areas around the <unk> region . The city 's population <unk> to 19 @,@ 922 in 1890 , and to 36 @,@ <unk> in 1900 with the arrival of additional railroads . By 1910 the population had hit 104 @,@ 000 , and Spokane eclipsed <unk> Walla as the commercial center of the Inland Empire . In time the city came to be known as the " capital " of the Inland Empire and the heart of a vast tributary region . After the arrival of the Northern Pacific , Union Pacific , Great Northern , and Chicago , Milwaukee , St. Paul and Pacific railroads , Spokane became one of the most important rail centers in the western U.S. 
 After mining declined at the turn of the 20th century , agriculture and logging became the primary influences in the Spokane economy . The population explosion and the building of homes , railroads , and mines in northern Idaho and southern British Columbia fueled the industry . Although overshadowed in importance by the vast <unk> areas on the coastal regions west of the <unk> , and <unk> with <unk> rail freight rates and stiff competition , Spokane became a noted leader in the manufacture of doors , window <unk> , <unk> , and other <unk> mill products . Rail freight rates were much higher in Spokane than the rates in coastal seaport cities such as Seattle and Portland , so much so that Minneapolis merchants could ship goods first to Seattle and then back to Spokane for less than shipping directly to Spokane , even though the rail line ran through Spokane on the way to the coast . [ f ] Local morale was affected for years by the collapse of the Division Street Bridge early in the morning on December 15 , 1915 , which killed five people and injured over 20 , but a new bridge was built ( eventually replaced in 1994 ) . The 1920 census showed a net increase of just 35 individuals , which actually indicates that thousands left the city when considering the natural growth rate of a population . Growth in the 1920s and 1930s remained slow but less drastically so , forcing city <unk> to market the city as a quiet , comfortable place suitable for raising a family rather than a dynamic community full of opportunity . The Inland Empire was heavily dependent on natural resources and <unk> goods produced from mines , forests , and farms , which experienced a fall in demand . The situation improved slightly with the start of World War II as aluminum production commenced in Spokane due to the area 's cheap electricity ( produced from regional dams ) and the increased demand for <unk> . 
 After decades of stagnation and slow growth , Spokane businessmen formed Spokane Unlimited in the early 1960s , an organization that sought to <unk> downtown Spokane . A recreation park showcasing the Spokane Falls was the preferred option , and after successful negotiation to relocate the railroad facilities on <unk> Island , Spokane hosted the first environmentally themed World 's Fair in Expo ' 74 on May 4 , becoming the smallest city at the time to host a World 's Fair . This event transformed Spokane 's downtown , removing a century of railroad infrastructure and <unk> the urban core . After Expo ' 74 , the <unk> became the 100 @-@ acre ( 40 ha ) <unk> Park . 
 The growth witnessed in the late 1970s and early 1980s was interrupted by another U.S. recession in 1981 , in which silver , timber , and farm prices dropped . The period of decline for the city lasted into the 1990s and was also marked by a loss of many steady family @-@ wage jobs in the manufacturing sector . Although this was a tough period , Spokane 's economy had started to benefit from some measure of economic <unk> ; growing companies such as Key <unk> and other research , marketing , and assembly plants for technology companies helped lessen Spokane 's dependence on natural resources . 
 As of 2014 , Spokane is still trying to make the transition to a more service @-@ oriented economy in the face of a less prominent manufacturing sector . <unk> the city 's strength in the medical and health sciences fields has seen some success , resulting in the expansion of the University District with a medical school branch . The city faces challenges such as a <unk> of high @-@ paying jobs , pockets of poverty , and areas of high crime . 
 The opening of the River Park Square Mall in 1999 sparked a downtown <unk> that included the building of the Spokane Arena and expansion of the Spokane Convention Center . Other major projects include the building of the Big Easy concert house ( now the <unk> Factory ) and renovation of the historic <unk> Hotel , the <unk> <unk> @-@ designed Davenport Hotel ( after being vacant for over 20 years ) , and the Fox Theater ( now home to the Spokane Symphony ) . The Kendall <unk> development on the west side of downtown Spokane is one of the largest construction projects in the city 's history . <unk> across the Spokane River from downtown , it will blend residential and retail space with <unk> and walking trails . 
 In August 2015 , the city entered a legal battle with international agricultural giant <unk> , alleging that the company has pumped harmful products into the Spokane River for decades , and insist the company be responsible for <unk> costs . The city also announced it will spend hundreds of millions of dollars to keep harmful products out of the river in the coming years . 
 Spokane is located on the Spokane River in eastern Washington at an elevation of 1 @,@ <unk> feet ( 562 m ) above sea level , about 20 miles ( 32 km ) from Idaho , 110 miles ( 180 km ) south of the Canadian border , 232 miles ( 373 km ) east of Seattle , and 277 miles ( 446 km ) southwest of Calgary . The lowest elevation in the city of Spokane is the <unk> point of the Spokane River within city limits ( in Riverside State Park ) at 1 @,@ 608 feet ( 490 m ) ; the highest elevation is on the northeast side , near the community of <unk> ( though closer to <unk> Hill and the North Hill Reservoir ) at 2 @,@ 591 feet ( 790 m ) . Spokane is part of the Inland Northwest region , consisting of eastern Washington , northern Idaho , northwestern Montana , and northeastern Oregon . According to the U.S. Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 60 @.@ 02 square miles ( 155 @.@ 45 km2 ) , of which 59 @.@ 25 square miles ( 153 @.@ 46 km2 ) is land and 0 @.@ 77 square miles ( 1 @.@ 99 km2 ) is water . 
 Spokane has a dry @-@ summer continental climate ( <unk> under the Köppen classification ) , a rare climate due to its elevation and significant winter precipitation ; Spokane , however , is adjacent to and sometimes even classified as a cool @-@ summer Mediterranean climate ( <unk> ) because the average temperature for the coldest month is just over 27 ° F ( − 3 ° C ) . 
 The area typically has a hot , arid climate during the summer months , <unk> by short spring and fall seasons . On average , July and August are equally warm , and the <unk> month is December ; July averages 69 @.@ 5 ° F ( 20 @.@ 8 ° C ) while December averages 27 @.@ 5 ° F ( − 2 @.@ 5 ° C ) . Daily temperature ranges are large during the summer , often exceeding 30 ° F ( 17 ° C ) , and small during the winter , with a range just above 10 ° F ( 5 @.@ 6 ° C ) . The reason is the very opposite weather existing between the extremely sunny summers and the extremely <unk> winters . The record high and low are 108 ° F ( 42 ° C ) and − 30 ° F ( − 34 ° C ) , but temperatures of more than 100 ° F ( 38 ° C ) or less than − 10 ° F ( − 23 ° C ) are rare . Temperatures above 90 ° F ( 32 ° C ) occur an average of 19 days annually , Temperatures above 100 ° F ( 38 ° C ) occur an average of only 1 day annually , and those below 0 ° F ( − 18 ° C ) average 3 @.@ 5 days a year . 
 Spokane 's location , between the <unk> Range to the west and the Rocky Mountains to the east and north , protects it from weather patterns experienced in other parts of the Pacific Northwest . The Cascade Mountains form a barrier to the eastward flow of moist and relatively mild air from the Pacific Ocean in winter and cool air in summer . As a result of the rain shadow effect of the <unk> , the Spokane area has 16 @.@ 5 inches ( 420 mm ) average annual precipitation , less than half of Seattle 's 37 inches ( 940 mm ) . The most precipitation occurs in December , and summer is the <unk> time of the year . The Rockies shield Spokane from some of the winter season 's coldest air masses traveling southward across Canada . 
 The City of Spokane operates under a mayor – council form of government , with executive and legislative branches . In 2011 , David <unk> was elected mayor as a non @-@ partisan candidate , taking office on the last business day of the year . The previous mayor was Mary <unk> , who succeeded the recalled James " Jim " West . Spokane voters have not reelected a mayor since 1973 , when incumbent David H. <unk> was granted a second term . The city elected James Everett Chase as its first African @-@ American mayor in 1981 , and after his retirement , elected the city 's first woman mayor , Vicki <unk> . Spokane is the county seat of Spokane County , a position it <unk> from <unk> in 1886 . 
 The crime rate per 1 @,@ 000 people in the Spokane metropolitan area ( Spokane County ) was 64 @.@ 8 in 2012 , higher than the Washington state average of 38 @.@ 3 ; the violent crime rate of 3 @.@ 8 and property crime rate of 61 also exceed the <unk> averages of 2 @.@ 5 and 35 @.@ 8 , respectively . Spokane 's crime rate is also higher for both violent and property crime than in 98 % of communities in the U.S. 
 Data shows that most crimes reported in the city tend to be focused around the downtown city center and its environs . Half of all property crimes are localized in about 6 @.@ 5 percent of the city . An individual in Spokane has a 1 in 140 chance of becoming a victim of <unk> , <unk> , motor vehicle theft , or <unk> . Spokane had the fourth highest rate of auto theft in the U.S. in 2010 and 2011 according to the National Insurance Crime Bureau . Drive @-@ by shootings and drug use , particularly crack cocaine use , became worse in the early 1990s , and four drive @-@ by shootings were recorded in December 1993 alone . In the 1990s , a special gang unit within the Spokane Police Department was established , with an officer " collecting intelligence on gang activity and <unk> it to street officers " . The 1990s also saw Spokane 's most prolific serial killer , Robert Lee <unk> , who killed thirteen prostitutes in Spokane 's East Sprague red light district and confessed to two others in <unk> , Washington . The transition of the Spokane Police Department to a community @-@ policing precinct model has been successful in <unk> crime rates since its introduction downtown , and has been expanded <unk> . 
 Spokane and the Spokane Police Department ( <unk> ) have received national publicity and scrutiny in the 2000s and 2010s due to many officer @-@ involved shootings and the use of excessive force . The most high @-@ profile of these incidents was the 2006 death of Otto <unk> , a mentally challenged man who was initially suspected of theft at a convenience store . <unk> was later found to have committed no crime , but was struck with <unk> by several officers and <unk> . The increased pressure on the <unk> prompted an independent review by a commission of the organization 's use @-@ of @-@ force policies , an internal culture audit , and the purchase of body cameras . 
 Spokane 's high crime rate is related to its being a major dumping ground for Washington state 's prison system . 
 The City of Spokane provides municipal water , wastewater management , and solid waste management . Spokane operates Washington 's only waste @-@ to @-@ energy plant as well as two solid waste transfer stations as part of the Spokane Regional Solid Waste System , a collaboration between the City of Spokane and Spokane County . Electricity generated by the waste @-@ to @-@ energy plant is used to operate the facility , with excess energy being sold to Puget Sound Energy . Spokane draws its water from the Spokane Valley – <unk> Prairie <unk> ; this 370 @-@ square @-@ mile ( <unk> km2 ) " sole source <unk> " is the only water supply for Spokane County in Washington , and for <unk> and <unk> counties in Idaho . 
 Natural gas and electricity are provided by the local utility , <unk> Utilities , while <unk> and <unk> provide television , internet , and telephone service .

 Spokane has been criticized and sometimes derided for its lack of diversity and <unk> offerings , but the city has become more diverse in recent decades . People from countries in the former Soviet Union ( especially Russians and <unk> ) form a comparatively large demographic in Spokane and Spokane County , the result of a large influx of immigrants and their families after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 . According to the 2000 Census , the number of people of Russian or Ukrainian ancestry in Spokane County was reported to be 7 @,@ 700 ( 4 @,@ 900 residing in the city of Spokane ) , amounting to two percent of the county .

Spokane was once home to a sizable Asian community , mostly Japanese , centered in a district called <unk> from the early days of the city until 1974 . As in many western railway towns , the Asian community started off as an encampment for migrant laborers working on the railroads . The <unk> Asian community <unk> until the 1940s , after which its population decreased and became integrated and dispersed , losing its Asian character ; urban <unk> and the preparations leading up to Expo ' 74 led to <unk> 's eventual demolition . 
 Spokane became an important rail and shipping center because of its location between mining and farming areas . In the early 1880s , gold and silver were discovered in the Inland Empire ; as a regional shipping center , the city furnished supplies to the miners who passed through on their way to the mineral @-@ rich <unk> d <unk> , <unk> and <unk> districts . The mining districts are still considered among the most productive in North America . 
 Natural resources have historically been the foundation of Spokane 's economy , with the mining , logging , and agriculture industries providing much of the region 's economic activity . After mining declined at the turn of the 20th century , agriculture and logging replaced mining as the primary influences in the economy . <unk> and <unk> working in the hundreds of mills along the railroads , rivers , and lakes of northern Washington and Idaho were <unk> themselves in Spokane . Agriculture has always been an important sector in the local economy ; the surrounding area , especially to the south , is the <unk> , a productive agricultural region that supports many vineyards and <unk> as well . By the early 20th century Spokane was primarily a commercial center rather than an industrial center . 
 As of 2013 , the top five employers in Spokane are the State of Washington , Spokane Public Schools , Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center and Children 's Hospital , the <unk> Air <unk> Wing , and Spokane County . The largest military facility and employer , the <unk> Air <unk> Wing , is stationed at <unk> Air Force Base near <unk> Heights . The leading industries in Spokane for the employed population 16 years and older were educational services , health care , and social assistance ( 26 @.@ 5 percent ) , retail trade ( 12 @.@ 7 percent ) , and arts , entertainment , recreation , and accommodation food services ( 10 @.@ 4 percent ) . As the metropolitan center of the Inland Northwest , as well as parts of southern British Columbia and Alberta , Spokane serves as a commercial , manufacturing , transportation , medical , shopping , and entertainment hub . In 2010 , the Spokane – Spokane Valley <unk> had a gross metropolitan product of $ 19 @.@ 48 billion . 
 As of 2014 , economic development in the Spokane area primarily focuses on promoting the following industries : manufacturing ( especially <unk> manufacturing ) , health sciences , professional services , information science and technology , finance and insurance as well as clean technology , and digital media . To aid economic development , the eastern branch of <unk> Washington , a state @-@ supported business <unk> was placed in the city . 
 Despite <unk> to new industries , Spokane 's economy has struggled in recent decades . Spokane was ranked the # 1 " <unk> City For Jobs " in America in both 2012 and 2015 , while also ranking # 4 in 2014 . Additionally , Forbes named Spokane the " <unk> Capital of America " in 2009 due to widespread business fraud .

Hill 's Great Northern Railway yard , placed outside Spokane city limits to avoid " burdensome taxes . " The downtown <unk> Business District , located on Market Street , was the Spokane neighborhood listed in the National Register of Historic Places . Many of the former town 's houses were built to house railroad workers , mainly immigrant laborers working in the local yard , who gave <unk> an independent , blue @-@ collar character . <unk> has become a home for much of Spokane 's growing Russian , Ukrainian , and Southeast Asian communities . 
 As an early affluent Spokane neighborhood , the Browne 's <unk> neighborhood and residences contain the largest variety of residential architecture in the city . These residences are lavish and <unk> , featuring many architecture styles that were popular and <unk> in the Pacific Northwest from the late 19th century to 1930 , such as the Victorian and Queen Anne styles .

Spokane was awarded the All @-@ America City Award by the National Civic League in 1974 , 2004 and 2015 . 
 Spokane offers an array of musical performances catering to a variety of interests . Spokane 's local music scene , however , is considered somewhat lacking by the Spokane All @-@ Ages Music Initiative and other critics , who have identified a need for a legitimate all @-@ ages venue for music performances .

The five most listened @-@ to stations are <unk> @-@ FM ( classic rock ) , <unk> @-@ AM ( news / talk ) , <unk> @-@ FM ( country ) , <unk> @-@ FM ( adult contemporary ) , and <unk> @-@ FM ( Hot AC ) . Spokane 's primary sources of non @-@ commercial and community radio include Spokane 's NPR @-@ affiliate station <unk> @-@ FM and <unk> , a full @-@ power community radio station . 
 The fortifications of Xi 'an ( Chinese : <unk> ) , also known as Xi 'an City Wall , in Xi 'an , an ancient capital of China , represent one of the oldest , largest and best preserved Chinese city walls . It was built under the rule of the <unk> Emperor Zhu <unk> as a military defense system . It exhibits the " complete features of the rampart architecture of feudal society " . It has been refurbished many times since it was built in the 14th century , <unk> at intervals of about 200 years in the later half of <unk> and <unk> , and in recent years in 1983 . The wall encloses an area of about 36 square kilometres ( 14 sq mi ) 
 The Xi 'an City Wall is on the tentative list of UNESCO 's World Heritage Site under the title " City <unk> of the Ming and Qing <unk> " . Since 2008 , it is also on the list of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage of the People 's Republic of China . Since March 1961 , the Xi 'an City Wall is a heritage National Historical and Cultural Town . 
 Xi 'an City Wall is located in the urban district of Xi 'an City , which at one time was an imperial city during the periods of the <unk> and Tang dynasties . It is situated at the end of the ancient Silk Road . 
 The wall was initially built solely from <unk> earth . During the <unk> Emperor 's period ( <unk> ) the wall was strengthened by laying blue bricks on the top and exterior faces of the earthen walls . During the reign of <unk> of the Qing Dynasty ( <unk> ) , the wall was enlarged ; drainage features , <unk> and other modifications were made ; and the structure as it is now seen came into existence . By the end of the Qing dynasty rule , the structure had begun to deteriorate . In a limited degree the Republican Authorities carried out maintenance of the wall , which was in a poor state . In the first decade of the 20th century , the wall 's defense system was considered to be of strategic importance , even though demolishing of similar walls in other regions of the country was undertaken following the 1911 Revolution . In 1926 , the wall was attacked with bombs by enemy forces resulting in serious structural damage , but the city within the wall was not affected . During the Second World War , when the Japanese carried out air bombings from 1937 to 1940 , the residents built around 1 @,@ 000 bunkers , as anti @-@ aircraft shelters within the wide base ( thickness of more than 15 metres ( 49 ft ) ) of the wall . A few escape openings were also made through the wall as passageways . Even later , new gates to allow traffic through the <unk> Wall were constructed during the Republican rule . 
 The Xi 'an City Wall was proposed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site by the State Administration of Cultural Heritage of the People 's Republic of China in 2008 . UNESCO included the site in the tentative List of World Heritage Sites under the title " City <unk> of the Ming and Qing <unk> " as a cultural heritage <unk> under <unk> <unk> & <unk> . In March 1961 , the Xi 'an City Wall was fully approved as a heritage site as a National Historical and Cultural Town . 
 Michelle Obama , the first lady of the United States , visited the Xi 'an City Wall on 24 March 2014 , describing it as " a wall that has withstood war and famine and the rise and fall of dynasties " . 
 The Xi 'an Wall is rectangular in shape and has a total length of 14 kilometres ( 8 @.@ 7 mi ) , with almost all stretches subjected to some kind of restoration or rebuilding . Along the top of the wall is a <unk> , which would typically take four hours to cover . It is built in the Chinese architecture style . As a defense fortification , it was constructed with a <unk> , <unk> , watch towers , corner towers , parapet walls and gate towers . The wall is 12 metres ( 39 ft ) in height with a width of 12 – 14 metres ( 39 – 46 ft ) at the top and base width of 15 – 18 metres ( 49 – 59 ft ) . <unk> are built at intervals of 120 metres ( 390 ft ) , projecting from the main wall . There are <unk> on the outer side of the wall , built with 5 @,@ <unk> <unk> , which form " altogether protruding <unk> " . There are four watch towers , located at the corners and the <unk> that surrounds the wall has a width of 18 metres ( 59 ft ) and depth of 6 metres ( 20 ft ) . The area within the wall is about 36 square kilometres ( 14 sq mi ) , enclosing the small area of 14 square kilometres ( 5 @.@ 4 sq mi ) occupied by the city . 
 The southern <unk> <unk> constructed in <unk> , was destroyed by fire in 1926 during the civil war of 1926 , and was restored in September 2014 . This was done after a careful historical review of documents related to the historical features that existed before it was damaged . The other three <unk> forming the northern , eastern and western gates of the wall were also examined during the planning phase of the modifications done for the South Tower . They were modified , without affecting the integrity of the wall , by an encompassing hall offering protection to the structures by using steel , wood work and the ancient @-@ type tiles and bricks structure . Major gates have ramp access except the South Gate which has entry outside the walls . 
 There is an " <unk> Tower " , which provides security to one of the four gates of the Xi 'an wall . <unk> as a large trap @-@ like chamber , capped by a tower filled with windows , it gave an <unk> position for <unk> to shoot arrows ( in the initial years of building the wall ) and later cannon balls at the opposing revolutionary forces . In the event that the enemy was able to breach the walls through the main gate they would become trapped in the small chamber that faced yet another gate and thus be easy targets for the defending troops . 
 Radio is the debut studio album by American rapper <unk> Cool J , released November 18 , 1985 on Def Jam Recordings in the United States . It serves as the label 's first full @-@ length album release . Recording sessions for the album took place during 1984 to 1985 at Chung King House of Metal in New York City . The album was primarily produced by Rick Rubin , who provided a sparse and minimal production style . Radio also features a sound that is <unk> by DJ scratching , mostly brief samples , and emphasis of the <unk> . <unk> Cool J 's b @-@ boy <unk> conveys themes of inner city culture , teenage promiscuity , and <unk> raps . 
 The album experienced a significant amount of commercial success and sales for a hip hop record at the time , earning U.S. Billboard chart success and selling over 500 @,@ 000 copies within its first five months of release . On April 19 , 1989 , Radio was certified platinum in sales by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) , following sales in excess of one million copies in the United States . Initial criticism of the album was generally positive , as <unk> Cool J 's <unk> and Rick Rubin 's production were praised by several music critics . It has since been recognized by critics as <unk> Cool J 's greatest work . 
 Reflecting the new school and <unk> <unk> in the U.S. during the mid @-@ 1980s , Radio belongs to a pivotal moment in the history and culture of hip hop . Its success contributed to the displacement of the old school with the new school form and to the genre 's mainstream success during the period . Its success also served as a career breakthrough for <unk> Cool J and Rick Rubin . Radio has been recognized by music writers as one of the first cohesive and commercially successful hip hop albums . 
 In March 1984 , when <unk> student Rick Rubin and promoter @-@ manager Russell Simmons founded the then @-@ independent Def Jam label , 16 year – old St. Albans , Queens native James Todd Smith was creating demo tapes in his grandparents ' home . His grandfather , a jazz saxophonist , purchased him $ 2 @,@ 000 worth of <unk> equipment , including two <unk> , an audio mixer and an amplifier . Smith later discussed his childhood background and rapping , stating that " By the time I got that equipment , I was already a rapper . In this neighborhood , the kids grow up in rap . It 's like speaking Spanish if you grow up in an all @-@ Spanish house . I got into it when I was about 9 , and since then all I wanted was to make a record and hear it on the radio . " By using the mixing table he had received from his grandfather , Smith produced and mixed his own demos and sent them to various record companies throughout New York City , including Simmons ' and Rubin 's own Def Jam Recordings . 
 Under his new stage name , <unk> Cool J ( an acronym for Ladies Love Cool James ) , Smith was signed by Def Jam , which led to the release of his first official record , the 12 @-@ inch single " I Need a Beat " ( 1984 ) . The single was a hard @-@ hitting , <unk> b @-@ boy song with spare beats and ballistic rhymes . Smith later discussed his search for a label , stating " I sent my demo to many different companies , but it was Def Jam where I found my home . " That same year , Smith made his professional debut concert performance at Manhattan Center High School . In a later interview , <unk> Cool J recalled the experience , stating " They pushed the lunch room tables together and me and my DJ , Cut Creator , started playing . ... As soon as it was over there were girls screaming and asking for <unk> . Right then and there I said ' This is what I want to do ' . " <unk> 's debut single sold over 100 @,@ 000 copies and helped establish both Def Jam as a label and Smith as a rapper . The commercial success of " I Need a Beat " , along with the <unk> Boys ' single " Rock Hard " ( 1984 ) , helped lead Def Jam to a distribution deal with Columbia Records the following year . 
 The album 's production , handled entirely by Rick Rubin with a remix by DJ <unk> Jay , has been noted by critics and music writers for Rubin 's <unk> style and stripped @-@ down aggressiveness . Steve Huey of AllMusic described the production for Radio as " bare @-@ bones " and " skeletal " , while calling the instrumentation " basically just a <unk> @-@ up <unk> . " The sound of Radio is mostly <unk> by DJ scratching and features occasional brief samples , which emphasize a <unk> . In <unk> up the musical style of Radio , Huey stated " The result is rap at its most skeletal , with a hard @-@ hitting , street @-@ level aggression that perfectly matches <unk> 's <unk> teenage energy . " 
 Author of the 1985 book Fresh : Hip Hop Don 't Stop , writer Nelson George further elaborated on the appeal of Radio to listeners at the time , describing <unk> Cool J as a " <unk> <unk> who knows his beats " , and stating " You can call it rap , hip hop or street , but it really is a way of hearing music — and <unk> hard — that expresses the experiences and attitudes of a great many inner city kids . <unk> Cool J is one of the best young <unk> around , because he speaks directly to and about his generation over large beats that recall Run @-@ <unk> , Trouble <unk> , James Brown , and <unk> little bits of AC / DC and Yes ... This teenage music is built around beats , but not just any old beats . It is all about a beat with style , with personality , and <unk> Cool J has plenty of both . " 
 Released November 18 , 1985 , on Def Jam Recordings in the United States , Radio earned a significant amount of commercial success and sales for a hip hop record at the time . Shortly after its release , the album sold over 500 @,@ 000 copies in its first five months , eventually selling over 1 million copies by 1988 , according to the Recording Industry Association of America . Radio peaked at number 6 on the Top R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Albums chart and at number 46 on the Billboard 200 albums chart . It entered the Top R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Albums chart on December 28 , 1985 , and remained there for forty @-@ seven weeks , while also entering the Pop Albums chart on January 11 , 1986 . Radio remained on the chart for thirty @-@ eight weeks . By 1989 , the album had earned platinum status from the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) , after earning a gold certification in the United States on April 14 , 1986 , with sales exceeding one million copies . 
 Radio received positive reviews from both " street and dance music " <unk> and mainstream music critics , including Robert Christgau from The Village Voice , who described it in a January 1986 article as " the most engaging and original rap album of the year " . <unk> Cool J 's aggressive rapping and Rick Rubin 's stripped @-@ down production were praised by critics who also agreed that <unk> 's lyrics set a new standard for MC 's at the time . The songs ' lyrics were favored by critics who described <unk> 's song @-@ writing as clever and fun . Connie Johnson of the Los Angeles Times said that he is an integral artist of hip hop 's " second generation " because of his " razor @-@ sharp wit " . Rolling Stone magazine 's <unk> Bull was impressed by his songwriting and how its originality lies in the ballads , even though " it 's the <unk> , dance @-@ worthy songs that make this record such an irresistible party . " The critical success of the album would later result in its comparison to other <unk> Cool J albums , which were not as critically successful as Radio . In his review for the <unk> Press , Ira <unk> called the album a " primary classic of hip @-@ hop 's original commercial surge " and went on to write : 
 Since its initial reception , Radio has been viewed by fans and critics as <unk> Cool J 's greatest work , as well as one of hip hop 's best albums . In <unk> , some critics and music writers have given more praise to producer Rick Rubin 's contributions to Radio , as well as note the importance of his production on the album . Yahoo ! Music 's Frank Meyer said that the album was " one of the earliest records , along with Run @-@ <unk> , to combine the vocal approach of rap with the musical arrangements and <unk> of rock ' n ' roll . ' I Can 't Live Without My Radio ' is a hip @-@ hop classic and this album set the standard for East Coast rap for a long time . " 
 Radio was later ranked at number 2 on ego trip magazine 's " Hip Hop 's 25 Greatest Albums ( 1980 @-@ 98 ) " , number 69 on Rolling Stone 's " 100 Best <unk> of the 80s " , and number 71 on Blender 's " 100 Greatest American Albums of All Time " list . In 2003 , Rolling Stone ranked the album number 478 on its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time ; it was ranked number 470 in a revised list in 2012 . The album was also included in Rolling Stone magazine 's 1997 issue of " The Essential 200 Rock Records " . In 1998 , Radio was selected as one of The Source magazine 's " 100 Best Rap Albums " . 
 The album 's success also helped in contributing to Rick Rubin 's credibility and repertoire as a record producer . Radio , along with <unk> Hell ( 1986 ) and <unk> to <unk> ( 1986 ) , would form a trilogy of New York City @-@ based , Rubin @-@ helmed albums that helped to <unk> hip @-@ hop . Rubin 's production credit on the back cover reads " <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> " , referring to his <unk> production style , which gave the album its stripped @-@ down and gritty sound . This style would serve as one of Rubin 's production <unk> and would have a great impact on future hip @-@ hop productions . Rubin 's early hip hop production work , before his exit from Def Jam to Los Angeles , helped solidify his legacy as a hip hop pioneer and establish his reputation in the music industry . 
 Radio 's release coincided with the growing new school scene and <unk> , which also marked the beginning of hip @-@ hop 's " golden age " and the replacement of old school hip hop . This period of hip hop was marked by the end of the disco rap <unk> of old school , which had flourished prior to the mid @-@ 80s , and the rise of a new style featuring " <unk> <unk> " . Radio served as one of the earliest records , along with Run @-@ <unk> ' s debut album , to combine the vocal approach of hip hop and rapping with the musical arrangements and <unk> sound of rock music , pioneering the rap rock hybrid sound . 
 The energy and hardcore delivery and musical style of rapping featured on Radio , as well as other new school recordings by artists such as Run @-@ <unk> , <unk> D , T La Rock and <unk> B , proved to be influential to hip hop acts of the " golden age " such as Boogie Down Productions and Public Enemy . The decline of the old school form of hip hop also led to the closing of Sugar Hill Records , one of the labels that helped contribute to early hip @-@ hop and that , <unk> , rejected <unk> 's demo tape . As the album served as an example of an expansion of hip hop music 's artistic possibilities , its commercial success and distinct sound soon led to an increase in multi @-@ racial audiences and listeners , adding to the legacy of the album and hip hop as well . 
 Sir Isaac Newton <unk> ( / <unk> / ; 25 December 1642 – 20 March 1726 / 27 ) was an English physicist and mathematician ( described in his own day as a " natural philosopher " ) who is widely recognised as one of the most influential scientists of all time and a key figure in the scientific revolution . His book <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ( " <unk> <unk> of Natural Philosophy " ) , first published in <unk> , laid the foundations for classical mechanics . Newton made seminal contributions to optics , and he shares credit with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for the development of <unk> . 
 Newton built the first practical reflecting telescope and developed a theory of colour based on the observation that a <unk> <unk> white light into the many colours of the visible spectrum . He formulated an <unk> law of cooling , studied the speed of sound , and introduced the notion of a <unk> fluid . In addition to his work on <unk> , as a mathematician Newton contributed to the study of power series , <unk> the binomial theorem to non @-@ <unk> <unk> , developed a method for <unk> the roots of a function , and classified most of the cubic plane curves . 
 Newton was a fellow of Trinity College and the second <unk> Professor of <unk> at the University of Cambridge . He was a devout but unorthodox Christian , and , unusually for a member of the Cambridge faculty of the day , he refused to take holy orders in the Church of England , perhaps because he privately rejected the doctrine of the Trinity . Beyond his work on the mathematical sciences , Newton dedicated much of his time to the study of biblical chronology and <unk> , but most of his work in those areas remained unpublished until long after his death . In his later life , Newton became president of the Royal Society . Newton served the British government as <unk> and Master of the Royal Mint . 
 Isaac Newton was born according to the Julian calendar ( in use in England at the time ) on Christmas Day , 25 December 1642 ( NS 4 January 1643 ) , at <unk> Manor in <unk> @-@ by @-@ <unk> , a hamlet in the county of Lincolnshire . His father , also named Isaac Newton , had died three months before . Born prematurely , he was a small child ; his mother Hannah <unk> reportedly said that he could have fit inside a <unk> <unk> . When Newton was three , his mother remarried and went to live with her new husband , the Reverend <unk> Smith , leaving her son in the care of his maternal grandmother , <unk> <unk> . The young Isaac disliked his stepfather and maintained some enmity towards his mother for marrying him , as revealed by this entry in a list of sins committed up to the age of 19 : " <unk> my father and mother Smith to burn them and the house over them . " Newton 's mother had three children from her second marriage . 
 From the age of about twelve until he was seventeen , Newton was educated at The King 's School , <unk> which taught Latin and Greek but no mathematics . He was removed from school , and by October <unk> , he was to be found at <unk> @-@ by @-@ <unk> , where his mother , widowed for a second time , attempted to make a farmer of him . Newton hated farming . Henry Stokes , master at the King 's School , persuaded his mother to send him back to school so that he might complete his education . <unk> partly by a desire for revenge against a <unk> <unk> , he became the top @-@ ranked student , distinguishing himself mainly by building <unk> and models of <unk> . 
 In April 1667 , he returned to Cambridge and in October was elected as a fellow of Trinity . <unk> were required to become ordained priests , although this was not enforced in the restoration years and an assertion of conformity to the Church of England was sufficient . However , by <unk> the issue could not be avoided and by then his unconventional views stood in the way . Nevertheless , Newton managed to avoid it by means of a special permission from Charles II ( see " Middle years " section below ) . 
 His studies had impressed the <unk> professor , Isaac Barrow , who was more anxious to develop his own religious and administrative potential ( he became master of Trinity two years later ) , and in 1669 , Newton succeeded him , only one year after he received his <unk> He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society ( FRS ) in 1672 . 
 Newton 's work has been said " to distinctly advance every branch of mathematics then studied " . His work on the subject usually referred to as <unk> or <unk> , seen in a manuscript of October 1666 , is now published among Newton 's mathematical papers . The author of the manuscript De <unk> per <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , sent by Isaac Barrow to John Collins in June 1669 , was identified by Barrow in a letter sent to Collins in August of that year as : 
 Mr Newton , a fellow of our College , and very young ... but of an extraordinary genius and <unk> in these things . 
 Newton had been reluctant to publish his <unk> because he feared controversy and criticism . He was close to the Swiss mathematician Nicolas <unk> de <unk> . In 1691 , <unk> started to write a new version of Newton 's <unk> , and corresponded with Leibniz . In 1693 , the relationship between <unk> and Newton deteriorated and the book was never completed . 
 Starting in <unk> , other members of the Royal Society ( of which Newton was a member ) accused Leibniz of plagiarism . The dispute then broke out in full force in <unk> when the Royal Society proclaimed in a study that it was Newton who was the true <unk> and labelled Leibniz a fraud . This study was cast into doubt when it was later found that Newton himself wrote the study 's concluding remarks on Leibniz . Thus began the bitter controversy which marred the lives of both Newton and Leibniz until the latter 's death in <unk> . 
 When Newton received his <unk> and became a Fellow of the " College of the Holy and <unk> Trinity " in 1667 , he made the commitment that " I will either set <unk> as the object of my studies and will take holy orders when the time prescribed by these statutes [ 7 years ] arrives , or I will resign from the college . " Up till this point he had not thought much about religion and had twice signed his agreement to the thirty @-@ nine articles , the basis of Church of England doctrine . 
 He was appointed <unk> Professor of <unk> in 1669 on Barrow 's recommendation . During that time , any Fellow of a college at Cambridge or Oxford was required to take holy orders and become an ordained Anglican priest . However , the terms of the <unk> <unk> required that the holder not be active in the church ( presumably so as to have more time for science ) . Newton argued that this should exempt him from the ordination requirement , and Charles II , whose permission was needed , accepted this argument . Thus a conflict between Newton 's religious views and Anglican <unk> was averted . 
 In 1666 , Newton observed that the spectrum of colours exiting a <unk> in the position of minimum <unk> is oblong , even when the light ray entering the <unk> is circular , which is to say , the <unk> <unk> different colours by different angles . This led him to conclude that colour is a property intrinsic to light — a point which had been debated in prior years . 
 From <unk> to 1672 , Newton <unk> on optics . During this period he investigated the refraction of light , demonstrating that the <unk> spectrum produced by a <unk> could be <unk> into white light by a lens and a second <unk> . Modern scholarship has revealed that Newton 's analysis and <unk> of white light <unk> a debt to <unk> <unk> . 
 He also showed that coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects . Newton noted that regardless of whether it was reflected , scattered , or transmitted , it remained the same colour . Thus , he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already @-@ coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves . This is known as Newton 's theory of colour . 
 Subsequent to Newton , much has been amended . Young and Fresnel combined Newton 's particle theory with <unk> ' wave theory to show that colour is the visible manifestation of light 's wavelength . Science also slowly came to realise the difference between perception of colour and <unk> optics . The German poet and scientist , <unk> , could not shake the <unk> foundation but " one hole <unk> did find in Newton 's armour , ... Newton had committed himself to the doctrine that refraction without colour was impossible . He therefore thought that the object @-@ glasses of telescopes must for ever remain <unk> , <unk> and refraction being incompatible . This inference was proved by <unk> to be wrong . " 
 The <unk> was published on 5 July <unk> with encouragement and financial help from Edmond Halley . In this work , Newton stated the three universal laws of motion . Together , these laws describe the relationship between any object , the forces acting upon it and the resulting motion , laying the foundation for classical mechanics . They contributed to many advances during the Industrial Revolution which soon followed and were not improved upon for more than 200 years . Many of these <unk> continue to be the <unk> of non @-@ <unk> technologies in the modern world . He used the Latin word <unk> ( weight ) for the effect that would become known as gravity , and defined the law of universal <unk> . 
 In the same work , Newton presented a <unk> @-@ like method of <unk> analysis using ' first and last ratios ' , gave the first analytical determination ( based on Boyle 's law ) of the speed of sound in air , inferred the <unk> of Earth 's <unk> figure , accounted for the <unk> of the <unk> as a result of the Moon 's gravitational attraction on the Earth 's <unk> , initiated the gravitational study of the irregularities in the motion of the moon , provided a theory for the determination of the orbits of comets , and much more . 
 Newton made clear his <unk> view of the Solar System — developed in a somewhat modern way , because already in the mid @-@ <unk> he recognised the " <unk> of the Sun " from the centre of gravity of the Solar System . For Newton , it was not precisely the centre of the Sun or any other body that could be considered at rest , but rather " the common centre of gravity of the Earth , the Sun and all the <unk> is to be esteem 'd the Centre of the World " , and this centre of gravity " either is at rest or moves uniformly forward in a right line " ( Newton adopted the " at rest " alternative in view of common consent that the centre , wherever it was , was at rest ) . 
 Newton 's <unk> of an invisible force able to act over vast distances led to him being criticised for introducing " occult agencies " into science . Later , in the second edition of the <unk> ( <unk> ) , Newton firmly rejected such criticisms in a concluding General <unk> , writing that it was enough that the phenomena implied a gravitational attraction , as they did ; but they did not so far indicate its cause , and it was both unnecessary and improper to frame hypotheses of things that were not implied by the phenomena . ( Here Newton used what became his famous expression " hypotheses non @-@ <unk> " ) . 
 With the <unk> , Newton became internationally recognised . He acquired a circle of admirers , including the Swiss @-@ born mathematician Nicolas <unk> de <unk> . 
 <unk> was the most important early influence on Newton the mathematician . <unk> freed plane curves from the Greek and <unk> limitation to <unk> sections , and Newton followed his lead by classifying the cubic curves in the plane . He found 72 of the 78 species of <unk> . He also divided them into four types , satisfying different <unk> , and in 1717 <unk> , probably with Newton 's help , proved that every cubic was one of these four types . Newton also claimed that the four types could be obtained by plane projection from one of them , and this was proved in <unk> . 
 According to Tom <unk> ( 1932 – 2008 ) , who published 8 volumes of Newton 's mathematical papers , it is no exaggeration to say that Newton mapped out the development of mathematics for the next 200 years , and that <unk> and others largely carried out his plan . 
 In the <unk> , Newton wrote a number of religious tracts dealing with the literal and symbolic interpretation of the Bible . A manuscript Newton sent to John Locke in which he disputed the fidelity of 1 John 5 : 7 and its fidelity to the original manuscripts of the New Testament , remained unpublished until 1785 . 
 Later works — The <unk> of Ancient Kingdoms <unk> ( <unk> ) and Observations Upon the <unk> of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St. John ( <unk> ) — were published after his death . He also devoted a great deal of time to <unk> ( see above ) . 
 Newton was also a member of the Parliament of England for Cambridge University in 1689 – 90 and 1701 – 2 , but according to some accounts his only comments were to complain about a cold draught in the chamber and request that the window be closed . 
 As <unk> , and afterwards Master , of the Royal Mint , Newton estimated that 20 percent of the coins taken in during the Great <unk> of <unk> were counterfeit . <unk> was high treason , punishable by the <unk> 's being hanged , drawn and quartered . Despite this , <unk> even the most <unk> criminals could be extremely difficult . However , Newton proved equal to the task . 
 As a result of a report written by Newton on 21 September 1717 to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty 's Treasury the <unk> relationship between gold coins and silver coins was changed by Royal proclamation on 22 December 1717 , <unk> the exchange of gold guineas for more than 21 silver <unk> . This inadvertently resulted in a silver shortage as silver coins were used to pay for imports , while exports were paid for in gold , effectively moving Britain from the silver standard to its first gold standard . It is a matter of debate as whether he intended to do this or not . It has been argued that Newton conceived of his work at the Mint as a continuation of his <unk> work . 
 Newton was made President of the Royal Society in 1703 and an associate of the French <unk> des Sciences . In his position at the Royal Society , Newton made an enemy of John Flamsteed , the <unk> Royal , by prematurely publishing Flamsteed 's Historia <unk> Britannica , which Newton had used in his studies . 
 In April <unk> , Queen Anne knighted Newton during a royal visit to Trinity College , Cambridge . The knighthood is likely to have been motivated by political <unk> connected with the Parliamentary election in May <unk> , rather than any recognition of Newton 's scientific work or services as Master of the Mint . Newton was the second scientist to be knighted , after Sir Francis <unk> . 
 Newton was one of many people who lost heavily when the South Sea Company collapsed . Their most significant trade was slaves , and according to his niece , he lost around £ 20 @,@ 000 . 
 Towards the end of his life , Newton took up residence at <unk> Park , near Winchester with his niece and her husband , until his death in 1727 . His half @-@ niece , Catherine Barton <unk> , served as his hostess in social affairs at his house on <unk> Street in London ; he was her " very loving Uncle , " according to his letter to her when she was recovering from smallpox . 
 Newton died in his sleep in London on 20 March 1727 ( OS 20 March 1726 ; NS 31 March 1727 ) and was buried in Westminster Abbey . <unk> may have been present at his funeral . A bachelor , he had <unk> much of his estate to relatives during his last years , and died <unk> . His papers went to John <unk> and Catherine Barton . After his death , Newton 's hair was examined and found to contain mercury , probably resulting from his <unk> <unk> . Mercury poisoning could explain Newton 's <unk> in late life . 
 Although it was claimed that he was once engaged , Newton never married . The French writer and philosopher <unk> , who was in London at the time of Newton 's funeral , said that he " was never sensible to any passion , was not subject to the common <unk> of mankind , nor had any commerce with women — a circumstance which was assured me by the physician and surgeon who attended him in his last moments " . The widespread belief that he died a virgin has been commented on by writers such as mathematician Charles Hutton , economist John Maynard Keynes , and physicist Carl <unk> . 
 Newton did have a close friendship with the Swiss mathematician Nicolas <unk> de <unk> , whom he met in London around 1690 . Their intense relationship came to an abrupt and unexplained end in 1693 , and at the same time Newton suffered a nervous breakdown . Some of their correspondence has survived . 
 In September of that year , Newton had a breakdown which included sending wild <unk> letters to his friends Samuel <unk> and John Locke . His note to the latter included the charge that Locke " <unk> to <unk> me with <unk> " . 
 The mathematician Joseph @-@ Louis <unk> often said that Newton was the greatest genius who ever lived , and once added that Newton was also " the most fortunate , for we cannot find more than once a system of the world to establish . " English poet Alexander Pope was moved by Newton 's accomplishments to write the famous <unk> : 
 Newton himself had been rather more modest of his own achievements , famously writing in a letter to Robert <unk> in February 1676 : 
 Two writers think that the above quotation , written at a time when Newton and <unk> were in dispute over optical discoveries , was an oblique attack on <unk> ( said to have been short and <unk> ) , rather than — or in addition to — a statement of <unk> . On the other hand , the widely known <unk> about standing on the shoulders of giants , published among others by seventeenth @-@ century poet George Herbert ( a former <unk> of the University of Cambridge and fellow of Trinity College ) in his <unk> <unk> ( 1651 ) , had as its main point that " a dwarf on a giant 's shoulders sees farther of the two " , and so its effect as an analogy would place Newton himself rather than <unk> as the ' dwarf ' . 
 I do not know what I may appear to the world , but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea @-@ shore , and diverting myself in now and then finding a <unk> <unk> or a <unk> shell than ordinary , whilst the great ocean of truth lay all <unk> before me . 
 In 1816 , a tooth said to have belonged to Newton was sold for £ 730 ( us $ 3 @,@ <unk> ) in London to an <unk> who had it set in a ring . The Guinness World Records 2002 classified it as the most valuable tooth , which would value approximately £ 25 @,@ 000 ( us $ 35 @,@ 700 ) in late 2001 . Who bought it and who currently has it has not been disclosed . 
 Albert Einstein kept a picture of Newton on his study wall alongside ones of Michael <unk> and James <unk> Maxwell . Newton remains influential to today 's scientists , as demonstrated by a 2005 survey of members of Britain 's Royal Society ( formerly headed by Newton ) asking who had the greater effect on the history of science , Newton or Einstein . Royal Society scientists deemed Newton to have made the greater overall contribution . In 1999 , an opinion poll of 100 of today 's leading physicists voted Einstein the " greatest physicist ever ; " with Newton the runner @-@ up , while a parallel survey of rank @-@ and @-@ file physicists by the site <unk> gave the top spot to Newton . 
 Newton 's monument ( <unk> ) can be seen in Westminster Abbey , at the north of the entrance to the choir against the choir screen , near his tomb . It was executed by the sculptor Michael <unk> ( 1694 – 1770 ) in white and grey marble with design by the architect William Kent . The monument features a figure of Newton <unk> on top of a sarcophagus , his right elbow resting on several of his great books and his left hand pointing to a scroll with a mathematical design . Above him is a pyramid and a celestial globe showing the signs of the <unk> and the path of the comet of <unk> . A relief panel depicts <unk> using instruments such as a telescope and <unk> . The Latin inscription on the base translates as : 
 From 1978 until 1988 , an image of Newton designed by Harry Ecclestone appeared on Series D £ 1 <unk> issued by the Bank of England ( the last £ 1 notes to be issued by the Bank of England ) . Newton was shown on the reverse of the notes holding a book and accompanied by a telescope , a <unk> and a map of the Solar System . 
 A statue of Isaac Newton , looking at an <unk> at his feet , can be seen at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History . A large bronze statue , Newton , after William Blake , by Eduardo <unk> , dated 1995 and inspired by Blake 's <unk> , dominates the <unk> of the British Library in London . 
 Although born into an Anglican family , by his thirties Newton held a Christian faith that , had it been made public , would not have been considered orthodox by mainstream Christianity ; in recent times he has been described as a <unk> . 
 By 1672 he had started to record his theological <unk> in <unk> which he showed to no one and which have only recently been examined . They demonstrate an extensive knowledge of early church writings and show that in the conflict between <unk> and <unk> which defined the Creed , he took the side of <unk> , the loser , who rejected the conventional view of the Trinity . Newton " recognized Christ as a divine mediator between God and man , who was subordinate to the Father who created him . " He was especially interested in prophecy , but for him , " the great <unk> was <unk> . " 
 Newton tried unsuccessfully to obtain one of the two <unk> that <unk> the holder from the ordination requirement . At the last moment in <unk> he received a dispensation from the government that <unk> him and all future holders of the <unk> chair . 
 In Newton 's eyes , <unk> Christ as God was idolatry , to him the fundamental sin . Historian Stephen D. <unk> says of Newton , " Isaac Newton was a <unk> . But ... he never made a public declaration of his private faith — which the orthodox would have deemed extremely radical . He hid his faith so well that scholars are still <unk> his personal beliefs . " <unk> concludes that Newton was at least a <unk> <unk> ( he owned and had thoroughly read at least eight <unk> books ) , possibly an <unk> and almost certainly an anti @-@ <unk> . 
 In a minority view , <unk> <unk> argues that Newton held the Eastern Orthodox view on the Trinity . However , this type of view ' has lost support of late with the availability of Newton 's theological papers ' , and now most scholars identify Newton as an <unk> <unk> . 
 Although the laws of motion and universal <unk> became Newton 's best @-@ known discoveries , he warned against using them to view the Universe as a mere machine , as if akin to a great clock . He said , " Gravity explains the motions of the planets , but it cannot explain who set the planets in motion . God governs all things and knows all that is or can be done . " 
 Along with his scientific fame , Newton 's studies of the Bible and of the early Church Fathers were also noteworthy . Newton wrote works on textual criticism , most notably An Historical <unk> of Two Notable <unk> of Scripture . He placed the <unk> of Jesus Christ at 3 April , AD 33 , which agrees with one traditionally accepted date . 
 Newton 's position was vigorously defended by his follower Samuel Clarke in a famous correspondence . A century later , Pierre @-@ Simon <unk> 's work " <unk> <unk> " had a natural explanation for why the planet orbits don 't require periodic divine intervention . 
 Newton and Robert Boyle 's approach to the mechanical philosophy was promoted by <unk> <unk> as a viable alternative to the <unk> and enthusiasts , and was accepted <unk> by orthodox preachers as well as <unk> preachers like the <unk> . The clarity and simplicity of science was seen as a way to combat the emotional and metaphysical <unk> of both superstitious enthusiasm and the threat of <unk> , and at the same time , the second wave of English <unk> used Newton 's discoveries to demonstrate the possibility of a " Natural Religion " . 
 The attacks made against pre @-@ <unk> " magical thinking " , and the mystical elements of Christianity , were given their foundation with Boyle 's mechanical conception of the Universe . Newton gave Boyle 's ideas their completion through mathematical proofs and , perhaps more importantly , was very successful in <unk> them . 
 Newton saw God as the master creator whose existence could not be denied in the face of the grandeur of all creation . 
 In a manuscript he wrote in <unk> in which he describes his attempts to extract scientific information from the Bible , he estimated that the world would end no earlier than <unk> . In predicting this he said , " This I mention not to assert when the time of the end shall be , but to put a stop to the rash <unk> of <unk> men who are frequently predicting the time of the end , and by doing so bring the sacred <unk> into discredit as often as their predictions fail . " 
 In the character of Morton <unk> in " <unk> Superman " ( 1951 ) , speculative fiction author <unk> <unk> says of Newton , " Everyone knows Newton as the great scientist . Few remember that he spent half his life <unk> with <unk> , looking for the philosopher 's stone . That was the <unk> by the <unk> he really wanted to find . " 
 Of an estimated ten million words of writing in Newton 's papers , about one million deal with <unk> . Many of Newton 's writings on <unk> are copies of other manuscripts , with his own <unk> . <unk> texts mix <unk> knowledge with philosophical speculation , often hidden behind layers of wordplay , allegory , and imagery to protect craft secrets . Some of the content contained in Newton 's papers could have been considered <unk> by the church . 
 In 1888 , after spending sixteen years <unk> Newton 's papers , Cambridge University kept a small number and returned the rest to the Earl of Portsmouth . In 1936 , a descendant offered the papers for sale at <unk> ’ s . The collection was broken up and sold for a total of about £ 9 @,@ 000 . John Maynard Keynes was one of about three dozen bidders who obtained part of the collection at auction . Keynes went on to <unk> an estimated half of Newton 's collection of papers on <unk> before <unk> his collection to Cambridge University in 1946 . 
 All of Newton 's known writings on <unk> are currently being put online in a project undertaken by Indiana University : " The <unk> of Isaac Newton " . The project is headed by William R. Newman . Here is a quote from the project web site . 
 Newton 's fundamental contributions to science include the <unk> of gravitational attraction , the discovery that white light is actually a mixture of immutable spectral colors , and the formulation of the <unk> . Yet there is another , more mysterious side to Newton that is <unk> known , a realm of activity that spanned some thirty years of his life , although he kept it largely hidden from his contemporaries and colleagues . We refer to Newton 's involvement in the discipline of <unk> , or as it was often called in seventeenth @-@ century England , " <unk> . " 
 <unk> philosophers chose a short history of scientific predecessors – Galileo , Boyle , and Newton principally – as the guides and <unk> of their applications of the singular concept of Nature and Natural law to every physical and social field of the day . In this respect , the lessons of history and the social structures built upon it could be discarded . 
 It was Newton 's conception of the Universe based upon Natural and <unk> understandable laws that became one of the seeds for <unk> ideology . Locke and <unk> applied concepts of Natural Law to political systems advocating intrinsic rights ; the <unk> and Adam Smith applied Natural <unk> of psychology and self @-@ interest to economic systems ; and sociologists criticised the current social order for trying to fit history into Natural models of progress . <unk> and Samuel Clarke resisted elements of Newton 's work , but eventually <unk> it to conform with their strong religious views of nature . 
 Newton himself often told the story that he was inspired to <unk> his theory of <unk> by watching the fall of an <unk> from a tree . Although it has been said that the <unk> story is a myth and that he did not arrive at his theory of gravity in any single moment , acquaintances of Newton ( such as William <unk> , whose manuscript account of <unk> has been made available by the Royal Society ) do in fact confirm the incident , though not the cartoon version that the <unk> actually hit Newton 's head . <unk> recorded in his Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton 's Life a conversation with Newton in Kensington on 15 April 1726 : 
 John <unk> , Newton 's assistant at the Royal Mint and husband of Newton 's niece , also described the event when he wrote about Newton 's life : 
 In the year 1666 he retired again from Cambridge to his mother in Lincolnshire . Whilst he was <unk> <unk> in a garden it came into his thought that the power of gravity ( which brought an <unk> from a tree to the ground ) was not limited to a certain distance from earth , but that this power must extend much further than was usually thought . Why not as high as the Moon said he to himself & if so , that must influence her motion & perhaps retain her in her orbit , whereupon he fell a <unk> what would be the effect of that <unk> . 
 In similar terms , <unk> wrote in his Essay on <unk> Poetry ( 1727 ) , " Sir Isaac Newton walking in his gardens , had the first thought of his system of <unk> , upon seeing an <unk> falling from a tree . " 
 It is known from his <unk> that Newton was grappling in the late 1660s with the idea that terrestrial gravity extends , in an <unk> @-@ square proportion , to the Moon ; however it took him two decades to develop the full @-@ fledged theory . The question was not whether gravity existed , but whether it extended so far from Earth that it could also be the force holding the Moon to its orbit . Newton showed that if the force decreased as the <unk> square of the distance , one could indeed calculate the Moon 's orbital period , and get good agreement . He guessed the same force was responsible for other orbital motions , and hence named it " universal <unk> " . 
 Various trees are claimed to be " the " <unk> tree which Newton describes . The King 's School , <unk> , claims that the tree was purchased by the school , uprooted and transported to the headmaster 's garden some years later . The staff of the [ now ] National Trust @-@ owned <unk> Manor dispute this , and claim that a tree present in their gardens is the one described by Newton . A descendant of the original tree can be seen growing outside the main gate of Trinity College , Cambridge , below the room Newton lived in when he studied there . The National Fruit Collection at <unk> can supply <unk> from their tree , which appears identical to Flower of Kent , a coarse @-@ <unk> cooking variety .

 HMS Furious was a modified <unk> @-@ class battlecruiser built for the Royal Navy ( RN ) during the First World War . Designed to support the Baltic Project championed by the First Sea Lord of the Admiralty , Lord John Fisher , the ship was very lightly armoured and designed to be armed with only two heavy guns ( 18 @-@ inch ) , one forward and one aft , plus a number of lesser guns . Furious was modified and became an aircraft carrier while under construction . Her forward turret was removed and a flight deck was added in its place , so that aircraft had to manoeuvre around the superstructure to land . Later in the war , the ship had her rear turret removed and a second flight deck installed aft of the superstructure , but this was less than satisfactory due to air turbulence . Furious was briefly laid up after the war before she was reconstructed with a full @-@ length flight deck in the early 1920s . 
 After her conversion , Furious was used extensively for trials of naval aircraft and later as a training carrier once the new armoured carriers like Ark Royal entered service in the late 1930s . During the early months of the Second World War the carrier spent her time hunting for German raiders in the North Atlantic and escorting convoys . This changed dramatically during the Norwegian Campaign in early 1940 when her aircraft provided air support to British troops ashore in addition to attacking German shipping . The first of what would be a large number of aircraft ferry missions was made by the carrier during the campaign . After the withdrawal of British troops in May , Furious made several anti @-@ shipping strikes in Norway with little result before beginning a steady routine of ferrying aircraft for the Royal Air Force . 
 At first Furious made several trips to West Africa , but she began to ferry aircraft to Gibraltar in 1941 . An unsuccessful attack on German @-@ occupied ports on the Arctic Ocean interrupted the ferry missions in mid @-@ 1941 . Furious was given a lengthy refit in the United States and spent a few months training after her return in April 1942 . She made several more ferry trips in mid @-@ 1942 before her aircraft attacked airfields in <unk> French Algeria as part of the opening stages of Operation <unk> in November 1942 . The ship remained in the Mediterranean until February 1943 when she was transferred to the Home Fleet . 
 Furious spent most of 1943 training , but made a number of attacks on the German battleship Tirpitz and other targets in Norway during the first half of 1944 . By September 1944 , the ship was showing her age and she was placed in reserve . Furious was decommissioned in April 1945 , but was not sold for scrap until 1948 . 
 During the First World War , Admiral Fisher was prevented from ordering an improved version of the preceding <unk> @-@ class battlecruisers by a wartime restriction that banned construction of ships larger than light cruisers . To obtain ships suitable for traditional battlecruiser roles , such as <unk> for fleets and hunting enemy raiders , he settled on ships with the minimal armour of a light cruiser and the armament of a battlecruiser . He justified their existence by claiming he needed fast , shallow @-@ draught ships for his Baltic Project , a plan to invade Germany via its Baltic coast . 
 Furious had an overall length of <unk> feet 9 inches ( 239 @.@ 8 m ) , a beam of 88 feet ( 26 @.@ 8 m ) , and a draught of 24 feet 11 inches ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) at deep load . She displaced 19 @,@ <unk> long tons ( 19 @,@ 826 t ) normally and 22 @,@ 890 long tons ( 23 @,@ 257 t ) at deep load . She had a <unk> height of 5 @.@ 33 feet ( 1 @.@ 6 m ) at deep load . Furious and her half @-@ sisters were the first large warships in the Royal Navy to have geared steam turbines . To save design time the installation used in the light cruiser Champion , the first cruiser in the RN with geared turbines , was copied and simply <unk> to provide two sets of turbines . The four Brown @-@ Curtis turbines were powered by eighteen <unk> small @-@ tube boilers that were designed to produce a total of 90 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 67 @,@ 000 kW ) . The ship 's speed was an estimated 31 @.@ 5 knots ( 58 @.@ 3 km / h ; 36 @.@ 2 mph ) , but she never ran her sea trials . 
 Furious was designed to normally carry 750 long tons ( 762 t ) of fuel oil , but could carry a maximum of 3 @,@ 160 long tons ( 3 @,@ <unk> t ) . At full capacity , she could steam for an estimated 6 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 11 @,@ 110 km ; 6 @,@ 900 mi ) at a speed of 20 knots ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) . The ship was designed to carry two BL 18 @-@ inch Mark I guns in two single turrets , one each fore ( ' A ' ) and aft ( ' Y ' ) . Her secondary armament consisted of 11 BL 5 @.@ 5 @-@ inch Mk I guns . A pair of QF 3 inch 20 cwt anti @-@ aircraft guns were mounted before the funnel . Furious also mounted two submerged tubes for 21 @-@ inch torpedoes and 10 torpedoes were carried . 
 Even as she was being built , Furious was modified with a large hangar capable of housing ten aircraft on her forecastle that replaced the forward turret . A 160 @-@ foot ( 49 m ) flight deck was built along its roof . Aircraft were flown off and , rather less successfully , landed on this deck . <unk> like the Short Type 184 used a four @-@ wheel trolley that ran down a track along the centre of the flight deck for take @-@ off . Aircraft were lifted by crane from the hangar to the flight deck . Although the aft turret was fitted and the gun tested , it was not long before Furious returned to her builders for further modifications . In November 1917 , the rear turret was replaced by a 300 @-@ foot ( 91 m ) deck for landing aircraft over another hangar . Her funnel and superstructure remained intact , with a narrow strip of <unk> around them to connect the fore and aft flight decks . <unk> from the funnel and superstructure was severe enough that only three landing attempts were successful before further attempts were forbidden . Her 18 @-@ inch guns were reused on Lord Clive @-@ class monitors General Wolfe and Lord Clive during the war . 
 Furious was laid down on 8 June 1915 at Armstrong Whitworth 's Low Walker shipyard in Newcastle upon <unk> . The ship was launched on 18 August 1916 and commissioned on 26 June 1917 . As completed , her complement numbered 737 officers and enlisted men . 
 On 2 August 1917 , while performing trials , Squadron Commander Edwin <unk> landed a <unk> <unk> , believed to have been <unk> , successfully on board Furious , becoming the first person to land an aircraft on a moving ship . On 7 August , he made one more successful landing in the same manner , but on his third attempt , in <unk> <unk> , the engine choked and the aircraft crashed off the starboard bow , killing him . The deck arrangement was unsatisfactory because aircraft had to manoeuvre around the superstructure in order to land . 
 In the meantime , all three <unk> @-@ class ships were assigned to the 1st Cruiser Squadron ( <unk> ) in October 1917 when the Admiralty received word of German ship movements on 16 October , possibly indicating a raid . Admiral Beatty , commander of the Grand Fleet , ordered most of his light cruisers and destroyers to sea in an effort to locate the enemy ships . Furious was detached from the 1st <unk> and ordered to sweep along the 56th parallel as far as 4 ° East and to return before dark . Her half @-@ sisters <unk> and Glorious were not initially ordered to sea , but were sent to reinforce the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron patrolling the central part of the North Sea later that day . Two German <unk> @-@ class light cruisers managed to slip through the gaps in the British patrols and destroyed the Scandinavia convoy during the morning of 17 October , but no word was received of the engagement until that afternoon . The 1st <unk> was ordered to attempt to intercept the German ships , but they proved to be faster than hoped and the British ships were unsuccessful . 
 Furious returned to the dockyard in November to have the aft turret removed and replaced by another deck for landing , giving her both a launching and a recovery deck . Two <unk> ( <unk> ) serving the <unk> were also installed . Furious was recommissioned on 15 March 1918 , and her embarked aircraft were used on anti @-@ <unk> patrols in the North Sea after May . In July 1918 , she flew off seven <unk> <unk> which participated in the <unk> raid , attacking the <unk> sheds there with moderate success . 
 Furious was laid up after the war , but was converted to an aircraft carrier with a continuous flight deck between June 1921 and September 1925 . Her design was based on experience gained with the first two British carriers , <unk> and Eagle , although this was very limited as <unk> was less than three years old and Eagle had only carried out 143 deck landings during her preliminary sea trials in 1920 . 
 The ship 's superstructure , masts , funnel and landing deck were removed and she was given a 576 @-@ by @-@ 92 @-@ foot ( 175 @.@ 6 by 28 @.@ 0 m ) flight deck that extended over three @-@ quarters of her length . This flight deck was not level ; it sloped upwards about three @-@ quarters of the way from the stern to help slow down landing aircraft , which had no brakes at that time . The fore @-@ and @-@ aft 320 @-@ foot ( 97 @.@ 5 m ) arresting gear was not intended to stop landing aircraft — the landing speeds of the time were low enough that this was unnecessary given a good <unk> — but rather to prevent aircraft from <unk> off to one side and potentially falling off the flight deck . Various designs for the flight deck were tested in a wind tunnel by the National Physical Laboratory which showed that the distinctive elliptical shape and rounded edges used <unk> turbulence . 
 Furious was not lengthened , but her beam was increased 1 foot ( 0 @.@ 3 m ) to 89 feet <unk> inches ( 27 @.@ 1 m ) and her average draught was now 27 feet 3 inches ( 8 @.@ 3 m ) at deep load , 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 6 m ) deeper than before the conversion . She displaced 22 @,@ 500 long tons ( 22 @,@ 900 t ) at normal load and 26 @,@ 500 long tons ( 26 @,@ 900 t ) at deep load , over 3000 long tons more than her previous displacement . Her <unk> height was 3 @.@ 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 1 m ) at deep load , a reduction of 1 @.@ 48 feet ( 0 @.@ 5 m ) after her conversion . During the ship 's post @-@ conversion sea trials she reached 30 @.@ 03 knots ( 55 @.@ 62 km / h ; 34 @.@ 56 mph ) . Her fuel capacity was increased by 700 long tons ( 710 t ) during her reconstruction , which increased her range to 5 @,@ 300 nautical miles ( 9 @,@ 800 km ; 6 @,@ 100 mi ) at a speed of 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) or 7 @,@ 480 nautical miles ( 13 @,@ 850 km ; 8 @,@ 610 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 Two 47 @-@ by @-@ 46 @-@ foot ( 14 @.@ 3 by 14 @.@ 0 m ) <unk> ( <unk> ) were installed to transfer aircraft between the flight deck and <unk> . No arresting gear was fitted and two 600 @-@ imperial @-@ gallon ( 2 @,@ 700 l ; 720 US gal ) ready @-@ use petrol tanks were provided for aircraft and the ship 's boats on the upper deck . An additional 20 @,@ 000 imperial gallons ( 91 @,@ 000 l ; 24 @,@ 000 US gal ) of petrol were in bulk storage . In 1939 , her complement consisted of 41 officers and 754 crewmen . 
 Furious retained ten of her original eleven breech @-@ loading 5 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 140 mm ) guns , five on each side , for self @-@ defence from enemy warships . Six QF 4 @-@ inch Mark V guns replaced her original anti @-@ aircraft guns . Four were mounted on the sides of the flying @-@ off deck and two on the quarterdeck . The four guns on the flying @-@ off deck were removed in 1926 – 27 for trials of the lower flight deck , but only two were replaced when the trials were concluded . Four single QF 2 @-@ pounder " <unk> @-@ <unk> " were installed in 1927 . During Furious 's September 1930 – February 1932 refit , her anti @-@ aircraft outfit was reinforced by the addition of two eight @-@ barrel QF 2 @-@ pounder Mark V <unk> @-@ <unk> mounts where the forward 4 @-@ inch guns on the flying @-@ off deck had been removed earlier . 
 The 5 @.@ 5 @-@ inch and 4 @-@ inch guns were replaced during her refit in early 1939 by a dozen QF 4 @-@ inch Mk XVI guns in twin dual @-@ purpose Mark <unk> mounts . One mount each was on the former flying @-@ off deck and the quarterdeck while the other four were mounted two per side . Two more Mark V 2 @-@ pounder mounts were added fore and aft of the newly added island superstructure at the same time . While later <unk> in the United States , the ship was fitted with a maximum of 22 manually operated automatic 20 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) Oerlikon light anti @-@ aircraft guns , which replaced the single quadruple Vickers .50 machine gun mount . 
 A single High Angle Control System director was fitted on the island and another on an elevated mount on the former flying @-@ off deck . Two <unk> @-@ <unk> directors were also mounted on the island for the weapons mounted fore and aft of the island . 
 Furious was reduced to reserve on 1 July 1930 in preparation for a lengthy overhaul at Devonport . It lasted from September 1930 to February 1932 and was focused on <unk> her machinery and re @-@ <unk> her boilers . In addition her quarterdeck was raised by one deck , the AA armament was revised and spraying facilities were fitted in the <unk> . Upon completion , she ran a full @-@ power trial on 16 February 1932 where her maximum speed was 28 @.@ 8 knots ( 53 @.@ 3 km / h ; 33 @.@ 1 mph ) from a total of 89 @,@ <unk> shaft horsepower ( 66 @,@ <unk> kW ) . 
 Furious recommissioned in May 1932 as part of the Home Fleet with a reduced crew before being brought up to full complement in November . <unk> arresting gear was fitted sometime during the mid @-@ 1930s . She was detached to the Mediterranean Fleet from May to October 1934 . Furious was present at the Coronation Fleet Review at Spithead on 20 May 1937 for George VI . She became a deck @-@ landing training carrier in 1937 , although she was refitted in Devonport between December 1937 and May 1938 where the forward end of her lower flight deck was raised to make her less wet forward . During the Munich Crisis in September 1938 , the ship embarked <unk> , <unk> and <unk> Squadrons and joined the fleet at Scapa Flow , before resuming her training duties after the peaceful conclusion of the affair . She was struck a glancing blow by the destroyer <unk> during this time , but suffered only minor damage . 
 The ship was given a more extensive refit from January to May 1939 that removed her 5 @.@ 5 @-@ inch guns and <unk> , mounted anti @-@ aircraft guns on her lower flying @-@ off deck , plated in the doors at the forward end of the upper hangar , and gave her a small island on the starboard side . Furious resumed her training duties after the completion of the refit and continued them until October 1939 . As a deck @-@ landing training carrier in 1939 Furious embarked 767 Squadron , flying Shark , <unk> and <unk> <unk> torpedo bombers and reconnaissance aircraft , and <unk> Squadron , flying Blackburn <unk> , Blackburn <unk> , and <unk> Sea <unk> fighters . 
 Furious joined the Home Fleet off the coast of Norway on 10 April 1940 with only eighteen <unk> from <unk> and <unk> Squadrons embarked ; no fighters were able to join the ship in time . Sixteen <unk> made unsuccessful torpedo attacks on German ships in Trondheim harbour the following morning . On 12 April , both squadrons attempted to attack German ships in Narvik in bad weather . <unk> with the failure of the torpedo attacks the previous day , bombs were carried instead . <unk> Squadron , making the first attack , damaged several captured Norwegian ships , but lost two aircraft to <unk> , although the crews were rescued by the British cruiser Penelope and the destroyer Punjabi . Following 40 minutes behind , <unk> Squadron was forced to turn back by heavy weather . One aircraft was lost while landing , but the crew was recovered . Another attack was launched the next day in support of the British ships entering Narvik , but they contributed little and another pair of <unk> were shot down . 
 Furious , ordered to remain behind after the bulk of the Home Fleet departed on 15 April , departed the Narvik area on 14 April , escorted by three destroyers , to refuel at Tromsø . <unk> route , her <unk> attacked Junkers Ju 52 transports that had landed on frozen Lake <unk> approximately 10 miles ( 16 @.@ 1 km ) north @-@ east of Narvik . Two of the Ju <unk> were destroyed and several others damaged . She reached the port on 16 April with only 27 % of her fuel remaining . She stayed there until 18 April when she headed south to scout the Narvik area . She was attacked en route by a single Heinkel He 111 bomber of the II . / KG 26 wing from very high altitude . Two large bombs narrowly missed the ship , the closest only 11 yards ( 10 @.@ 1 m ) off the port side aft . The shock shook her propeller shafts out of alignment and jarred the port inner high @-@ pressure turbine so that she was limited to 20 knots ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) . Furious remained off the coast of Norway despite the damage and attempted to fly off aircraft on 22 April , despite severe weather , to discourage German aircraft from delivering supplies to the German forces in Narvik . One aircraft was shot down by the Germans and the others returned reporting heavy <unk> between the ship and Narvik . The weather worsened the next day and Captain <unk> decided to head to Harstad to check the damage from the near miss . It proved worse than anticipated and he was ordered back to the United Kingdom . Only six of the nine remaining <unk> were <unk> . 
 After quick repairs , which included the removal of several rows of turbine <unk> , Furious returned to Norway on 18 May carrying the <unk> of a reformed Royal Air Force 263 Squadron ; they were flown off on 21 April once their base at Bardufoss was ready . One <unk> and the guiding <unk> crashed en route , killing all crewmen . The ship returned to Scapa Flow once all the <unk> had been flown off , carrying only six Sea <unk> of <unk> Squadron and nine <unk> of <unk> Squadron for self @-@ protection while ferrying 263 Squadron . 
 On 14 June , carrying only half of <unk> Squadron for her own protection , Furious sailed <unk> for Halifax carrying £ 18 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 in gold <unk> . On 1 July she escorted a convoy of Canadian troops bound for Iceland from Halifax and ferried over almost 50 aircraft with spare parts and munitions . On his own initiative , Captain <unk> ordered all available space should be used to transport sugar to Britain . Upon her arrival , she embarked the rest of <unk> Squadron , as well as nine <unk> of <unk> Squadron and nine <unk> of <unk> , and made a number of largely unsuccessful air strikes on shipping in Norwegian waters and on the seaplane base at Tromsø in September and October 1940 , at a cost of several aircraft . Both <unk> squadrons disembarked afterwards to make room as she prepared to resume her role as an aircraft transport . 
 Furious now had a new destination for her ferry trips and she transported 24 Hurricanes to Gibraltar on 25 April where they were transferred to Ark Royal to be flown off for Malta . She sailed for a brief refit at Belfast immediately afterwards . While in Belfast she was hit by one small bomb and near @-@ missed by two others during a German air raid in early May , but was only lightly damaged . The ship loaded another batch of 40 Hurricane <unk> , plus nine <unk> from ' X ' Flight of 800 Squadron in Liverpool , and arrived back in Gibraltar on 18 May . Some of these fighters were moved to Ark Royal via <unk> between the flight decks of the carriers berthed stern to stern . This time she accompanied Ark Royal and the two carriers flew off their fighters from a position south of Sardinia . Furious loaded 48 more Hurricane <unk> and arrived back in Gibraltar on 1 June where some of the fighters were transferred to Ark Royal . The two carriers departed Gibraltar on 4 June and flew off 44 of the 48 fighters . Furious returned to the Clyde for her biggest load of aircraft yet , 64 Hurricanes , leaving room for only nine <unk> from <unk> Squadron on this voyage . Upon her arrival on 25 June she transferred 22 Hurricanes to Ark Royal and that carrier flew them off to Malta the next day . Of the 42 Hurricanes left on Furious , 26 were moved to Ark Royal when she returned on 28 June . This time , however , both carriers sailed to deliver the fighters to their usual take @-@ off point west of Sicily . The tenth of Furious 's aircraft to take off crashed into her island , killing 14 men and starting a serious fire on the flight deck . The blocked flight deck forced the remaining six Hurricanes to remain on board and they were returned to Gibraltar . Furious exchanged <unk> Squadron for <unk> from Ark Royal , then departed for home . 
 On 30 August , Furious left Belfast with a load of 49 Hurricanes , carrying three <unk> of 800 Squadron and four Sea Hurricane <unk> of <unk> Squadron for self @-@ defence , and nine <unk> of <unk> Squadron for Ark Royal . She arrived in Gibraltar on 6 September and transferred 40 Hurricanes to the other carrier the next day . Ark Royal sailed for the departure point the following day , but could only fly off 14 Hurricanes because some of the Bristol <unk> bombers used to guide the fighters to Malta failed to make their rendezvous . When Ark Royal returned , she transferred the six <unk> of <unk> Squadron to Furious and both carriers departed that same day to deliver the Hurricanes . This was Furious 's last ferry mission as she was sent to Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , for a lengthy refit . She arrived on 7 October and did not return to the United Kingdom until April 1942 . 
 Furious spent the next three months after her return working up . In August , she was detailed to accompany the convoy bound for Malta in Operation <unk> , but she was only to sail far enough with them to allow her 38 <unk> <unk> to reach Malta . This she did , just as Eagle was torpedoed , but Furious turned around after flying off her fighters and reached Gibraltar successfully . She loaded another batch of 32 <unk> on 16 August and they were flown off the following day south @-@ east of the <unk> Islands . After this mission , Furious was sent back to the Home Fleet for training . One last mission was necessary to reinforce the defences of Malta before Operation <unk> and the ship arrived at Gibraltar on 27 October . She loaded 32 <unk> and launched them on 29 August before returning to Gibraltar and being assigned to Force H. 
 The Home Fleet tried another attack on Tirpitz later on 23 April , but bad weather prevented any attack from being made that day and for the next several days . Instead , the aircraft attempted to attack installations at Bodø on 26 April , but found a German convoy instead and sank three ships . Furious and the escort carrier <unk> attacked shipping in the vicinity of Kristiansund and sank the ore carrier <unk> and the <unk> <unk> for the loss of two aircraft on 6 May . Another attack on Tirpitz by the Home Fleet had to be abandoned on 15 May because of poor weather . Yet another attempt on 28 May was <unk> by bad weather , but a German convoy was successfully attacked on 1 June . One ammunition ship was sunk and two others were set on fire . 
 By this time the ship 's age and limitations became increasingly apparent and she was placed in reserve on 15 September 1944 . The ship was paid off in April 1945 and , berthed at Loch <unk> , was used to evaluate the effects of aircraft explosives on the ship 's structure . Furious was sold in 1948 for scrap , and had been completely broken up in <unk> by 1954 . 
 Warning from Space ( <unk> , <unk> Tokyo <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> in Tokyo ) is a Japanese science fiction <unk> film released in January 1956 by <unk> , and was the first Japanese science fiction film to be produced in color . In the film 's plot , <unk> @-@ like aliens disguised as humans travel to Earth to warn of the imminent collision of a rogue planet and Earth . As the planet rapidly <unk> toward Earth , a nuclear device is created at the last minute and destroys the approaching world . 
 The film , directed by <unk> <unk> , was one of many early Japanese monster films quickly produced after the success of <unk> 's <unk> in 1954 . The film was loosely based on a novel by <unk> Nakajima . After release , the film was met with negative reviews , with critics calling it " bizarre " and accusing it of using science fiction <unk> . Warning from Space influenced many other Japanese science fiction films , such as <unk> . The film , along with other 1950s science fiction films , influenced director Stanley Kubrick , who would later direct 2001 : A Space Odyssey . 
 A small ship travels to a rotating space station . <unk> the station , a group of <unk> @-@ like beings discuss how to warn humans of an impending disaster , deciding on <unk> Japanese scientist Dr. <unk> . Meanwhile , flying <unk> are spotted over the skies of Tokyo , <unk> scientists . A journalist tries to get a statement from Dr. <unk> about the sightings , but <unk> replies that there is not enough evidence to <unk> a hypothesis . At an observatory , Professor <unk> spots an object in his telescope apparently releasing smaller objects . 
 On Earth , <unk> , <unk> 's son , discovers the disguised alien floating in the water . After her rescue , she exhibits superhuman characteristics such as jumping ten feet and <unk> in different places without walking . Soon , she <unk> Dr. <unk> 's work on a nuclear device , explaining she <unk> the complex <unk> he was writing and warning against the effects of a device , leading him to believe she is not human . Shortly afterwards , as the team of scientists discuss her abnormal traits , the camouflaged <unk> appears and reveals her true identity , explaining she is from <unk> , a world on the same orbit as Earth but on the opposite side of the Sun . She then continues to reveal her mission , to warn Earth of an imminent collision of a rogue planet , which is dubbed " Planet R " by the media . They appeal to the World Congress about the situation , but are swiftly rejected . Only after they show Planet R and its rapid acceleration in the telescope does the World Congress launch its nuclear weapons , which <unk> explode on its surface . 
 In the meantime , a group of <unk> have abducted <unk> and are attempting to steal his formula to the nuclear device the disguised <unk> warned him about . <unk> does not comply and is eventually tied to a chair in a remote building . As the Earth 's atmosphere <unk> up due to the approaching world , <unk> again arrives to learn why Planet R is not yet destroyed . They locate <unk> through <unk> technology and gather the formula for the device . The scientists then all watch as the nuclear device is shot from the space station and destroys Planet R , cooling the atmosphere and removing the threat . <unk> then changes back to her original form aboard the space station . 
 After the success of <unk> 's 1954 film <unk> , which depicted a giant dinosaur attacking Tokyo , many Japanese film studios began to produce similar monster films , including Warning from Space . Along with other films such as <unk> 's <unk> Attack of the Flying <unk> and the American Forbidden Planet , Warning from Space became part of a fledgling subgenre of films based around science fiction creatures . The film also used the theme of atomic bombs that was present in many films at the time , but showed how the weapons , which devastated the Japanese cities of <unk> and <unk> a decade earlier , could be put to good use . Still others noted the film used another common theme of cosmic collisions in the style of earlier films such as the 1931 film End of the World , which depicted a comet on a collision course with the Earth . 
 The <unk> aliens were designed by the prominent avant @-@ garde artist <unk> <unk> , which used a single eye that is common among science fiction aliens . Although official film posters showed the <unk> aliens towering over buildings , the actual cinematic version of the aliens were on the scale of humans , at about two meters . Walt Lee reports that <unk> Nakajima 's novel , on which this film was based , was in turn based on the Japanese folktale <unk> @-@ <unk> . The film was one of fourteen Japanese color pictures produced in early 1956 , but the first color Japanese science @-@ fiction film . 
 In his biography of Stanley Kubrick , author John <unk> traces Kubrick 's interest in science fiction films , which led to his 2001 : A Space Odyssey , to the Japanese <unk> <unk> films of the 1950s , including Warning from Space , with its " <unk> two @-@ metre @-@ tall black <unk> with a single central eye , who walk en <unk> like ballet dancers . " <unk> notes that despite their " clumsy model sequences , the films were often well @-@ photographed in colour ... and their <unk> dialogue was delivered in well @-@ designed and well @-@ lit sets . " 
 " <unk> " is the seventh episode of the thirteenth season of the American animated television series South Park . The <unk> overall episode of the series , it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 22 , 2009 and in the United Kingdom on April 24 , 2009 . It was the mid @-@ season finale , marking the final South Park episode for six months . In the episode , <unk> <unk> news reports about piracy in the Indian Ocean to mean the return of the classic era of <unk> pirates , and <unk> a handful of South Park boys to voyage to Mogadishu to start a pirate crew . 
 The episode was written and directed by series co @-@ founder Trey Parker , and was rated TV @-@ <unk> L in the United States for strong to extreme language . " <unk> " was a reference to increasing international media attention to piracy in the Indian Ocean , and the script depicted the pirates in a sympathetic light . The crew of the USS <unk> , the <unk> Burke @-@ class guided missile destroyer which participated in the rescue of the <unk> <unk> <unk> Alabama , contacted the South Park creators to praise them for the episode . " <unk> " received generally positive reviews and was seen by 2 @.@ 59 million households in its original broadcast , making it the most @-@ watched Comedy Central production the week it aired . 
 Having misunderstood the news about an <unk> of piracy in the Indian Ocean , <unk> <unk> tells his friends the classic era of piracy has returned , and asks the boys to join him in becoming a pirate in what he describes as a responsibility @-@ free life in a warm tropical <unk> . <unk> an opportunity to get rid of <unk> once and for all , Kyle encourages him to go , even offering to help pay for his ticket . Although <unk> , Ike , Clyde and Kevin are the only students who agree to join his crew , an <unk> <unk> uses his mother 's credit card to book a trip to Somalia . After a long flight and a 49 @-@ hour bus ride , the boys arrive in Mogadishu dressed as stereotypical pirates . Once there , however , they are shocked to find themselves in a desolate land , the complete opposite of their expectations . 
 " <unk> " was written and directed by series co @-@ creator Trey Parker . It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 22 , 2009 and was the mid @-@ season finale , marking the final South Park episode until October 2009 . " <unk> " is based on real @-@ life piracy in the Indian Ocean , which began receiving increasing international media attention in 2008 until its demise in 2012 / 2013 . 
 The episode began production two weeks before its <unk> , with the intention to broadcast it on April 15 , 2009 . The writing team had developed the idea for <unk> <unk> <unk> piracy for classic piracy amid the pirate <unk> of the <unk> <unk> Alabama at the time . Captain Richard Phillips was taken hostage in the event , and Parker and Stone decided to hold the episode indefinitely , although animation had begun . Realizing the severity of the situation — if Phillips were killed and the South Park episode seemed to mock the situation — they decided to resume work on the episode " <unk> Derby " , which had been in production for a while , as the creators had no idea to where to go with its story . When Phillips was rescued over the weekend , they wanted to resume work on " <unk> " , but as animation work on the episode proved difficult , including new sets depicting Somalia , it was decided it would be <unk> . 
 The episode 's ending was unusual , as many episodes of South Park tend to resolve the episode 's events ; in " <unk> " , the main characters don 't return home and are shown at the end still in Somalia . An alternate ending made it to the <unk> stage , in which <unk> , in a self @-@ <unk> manner , <unk> the show on the conclusion of the season and invites the season 's celebrity parodies ( among those the Jonas Brothers and Kanye West ) . The ending , which Parker likened to that of a variety show , was something he felt was funny in writing but didn 't succeed visually . 
 While most South Park episodes feature Parker and Stone providing almost all the voice acting , " <unk> " included several French @-@ speaking actors providing the lines of the schooner crew . Outside voice actors were also brought in for the role of the <unk> pirates , including Abdi <unk> <unk> , <unk> Ali , Abdullahi Prime , and Julien <unk> . The week after its original broadcast , in response to requests by fans , the full 90 @-@ second version of episode 's sea <unk> song , " <unk> Pirates , We " was made available for download on South Park Studios , the official South Park website . Shortly after " <unk> " was originally broadcast , the site also featured six different types of T @-@ shirts and hooded <unk> based on the episode . 
 The ending , in which the pirates are each shot to death by American <unk> , reflects the resolution of the pirate <unk> of the <unk> <unk> Alabama in April 2009 , where U.S. Navy <unk> rescued the captain after three <unk> simultaneously killed three pirates with one shot each . They are portrayed in a particularly sympathetic light when they are killed during the ending . Travis Fickett of IGN said , " It 's one of those moments where South Park feels the need to give voice to a side the media is ignoring — and points out that things aren 't quite as cut and dry [ sic ] as we might like . " The episode has also been described as a commentary on the way in which Americans tend to take their relative wealth and comfort for granted . A U.S. Navy <unk> ordering another to " not hit the white ones " has also been described as an <unk> of the American approach to foreign policy . 
 " <unk> " , along with the thirteen other episodes from South Park 's thirteenth season , were released on a three @-@ disc DVD set and two @-@ disc Blu @-@ ray set in the United States on March 16 , 2010 . The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode , a collection of deleted scenes , and a special mini @-@ feature Inside Xbox : A Behind @-@ the @-@ Scenes Tour of South Park Studios , which discussed the process behind <unk> the show with Inside Xbox host Major Nelson .

 Jeremy Davis — the band 's bassist — <unk> on what they felt before releasing the song , " After we started writing weird stuff like ' Ain 't It Fun ' , we got nervous . But that was a comfort . We 've grown and we don 't like the same music we liked , so why would [ our fans ] not ? That idea kept us pushing ourselves . " York considered that the decision to bring a gospel choir would have been difficult to approve if the original lineup of the band had remained . The track was mixed by Ken Andrews , and mastered by Ted Jensen at Sterling Sound Studios . 
 The gospel choir first appears in the song during its bridge . <unk> the choir 's feature , David <unk> of NME commented that the song " pull [ s ] a Sister Act 2 . " The vocal ranges of Williams and the gospel choir spans from <unk> to C ♯ 5 . The former 's vocal performance was described by <unk> 's Chris <unk> as having influences of Michael Jackson , whereas <unk> compared Williams ' vocal style in " Ain 't It Fun " to that of Mariah Carey . <unk> considered that the participation of the choir helped Williams sing " some of her most soulful vocals ever . " Joseph R. <unk> of the Philippine Daily Inquirer further analyzed Williams ' vocal performance in the song : 
 [ ... ] lead vocalist Hayley Williams is starting to show more of her musical chops – from her <unk> to the soulful “ touches ” in her singing style , particularly in this single . These nuances in her voice signify to me that , vocally , she has entered her prime already . You can hear these changes specifically in the chorus and refrain sections of this single wherein she sings with greater confidence . Here , the versatility of her voice takes shape and we begin to take serious notice of what she can do more behind the <unk> . 
 The track 's lyrics , structured in verse – chorus form and written in second person narrative , predominantly feature a sarcastic tone . They were inspired by Williams ' decision to move from Nashville to Los Angeles . She considered this idea after feeling overwhelmed by the <unk> , in Nashville , of Josh and <unk> <unk> 's departure from <unk> . Williams said , " I took off for L.A. as if it was going to be some kind of <unk> or saving grace . I got there and realized that my problems were following me . Okay , so I was having a bad six months ? Get over it . [ sic ] " The song was penned as a message regarding her behavior , in order for her to cope with her decision . She stated , " No one else was saying that to me , so I had to say it to myself . " musicOMH 's Thomas Ingham interpreted its lyrics as focusing on a " serious ' all alone in the world ' " theme , while <unk> Gazette @-@ Times 's journalist called them " blunt " and wrote that they discuss " growing up " . The writer also believed that its theme would make the song a prominent track at graduation ceremonies . <unk> viewed a contrast between the song 's melody and lyrical content .

 Jimmy works on writing jokes for his comedy routine while <unk> sits on his <unk> , eating potato chips . Jimmy comes up with a joke with almost no assistance from <unk> ( he only helped Jimmy originate the joke by telling Jimmy he was hungry for something more substantial than fruit , and Jimmy suggested there might be some <unk> in the freezer ) : 
 Jimmy : Do you like <unk> ? <unk> : <unk> : Do you like putting <unk> in your mouth ? <unk> : <unk> : What are you , a gay fish ? 
 The joke , which plays on the similarity of the phrases " <unk> " and " fish <unk> " when spoken , becomes a hit throughout South Park . When <unk> begins taking half credit for the joke , Kyle tells Jimmy he should stand up to <unk> . When Jimmy tells <unk> he feels he wrote most of the joke , <unk> fears Jimmy will try to take full credit and asks Kyle for advice on how to deal with Jimmy . Kyle instead says he believes Jimmy wrote the entire joke , and suggests that <unk> 's ego is so big that he <unk> remembers things incorrectly to make himself feel more important . This is supplemented by <unk> 's flashbacks to the creation of the joke , which become more overblown and ridiculous as the episode goes on , showing him to truly believe that he deserves credit . 
 However , in a deleted scene , West drowns and his body is picked up and discovered by the US coast guards . 
 Although the joke originally stemmed from <unk> <unk> and not Kanye West , Parker and Stone said they realized West would probably be extremely <unk> about the joke and not understand it , so they decided the episode should revolve mostly around him . After coming up with the idea , Parker and Stone waited a long time before they finally wrote the script because , Stone said , " It just seemed too dumb . Are we really going to do a whole episode about this ? " Stone said the jokes about Carlos <unk> were " just a complete <unk> " that came about during the writing process . During one scene in " <unk> " , <unk> steals credit from Jimmy for a joke he did not write . This was inspired by people Parker and Stone have worked with in the television business who were present for discussions the duo had , then later claimed credit for the idea even though they had nothing to do with it . Stone said , " They truly believe they did it . That 's the really sinister part . It 's not where they 're trying to steal part of the glory . ... They actually fully believe that they came up with it . " 
 Parker provided the voice of Kanye , both in the episode and in " Gay Fish " , a full @-@ length song featured at the end of the episode about West 's realization that he actually is a gay fish . Parker used a large amount of Auto @-@ <unk> pitch audio processing , which he had never used before . Parker said he eventually discovered he had to sing off @-@ key on purpose in order to get the desired effect . Parker said , " You had to be a bad singer in order for that thing to actually sound the way it does . " The day after " <unk> " was broadcast , the full two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half minute version of the Kanye West spoof , " Gay Fish " , was made available for download on South Park Studios , the official South Park website . The site also featured T @-@ shirts and hooded <unk> based on the episode . One featured Jimmy asking , " Do you like <unk> ? " The other features text from Kanye West 's <unk> in the episode : " <unk> + Me = <unk> " . 
 A Kanye West song in the episode about the fact that he is indeed a " gay fish " is a parody of the West song " Heartless " , from his 2008 recording <unk> & Heartbreak and <unk> the rapper 's usage of Auto @-@ <unk> pitch audio processing . When West first confronts <unk> and Jimmy , <unk> mistakes him for <unk> Daddy , another rapper and record producer . 
 Talk show hosts Jimmy <unk> , David Letterman , Conan O 'Brien , Jay <unk> and Ellen <unk> were featured in the episode . <unk> is voiced by his real @-@ life brother Jonathan <unk> , who previously served as a writer and voice actor on South Park . 
 During a fantasy sequence , <unk> says " flame on " and turns into a fiery , flying superhero ; this is a reference to the Human <unk> , a superhero and member of the Fantastic Four . 
 In its original American broadcast , " <unk> " was watched by 3 @.@ 1 million overall households , according to the Nielsen Media Research , making it the most @-@ watched Comedy Central production of the week . It had over 1 @.@ 2 million more household viewers than the second most @-@ watched Comedy Central show that week , the April 8 episode of The Daily Show . In June 2009 , " <unk> " was announced to be the most watched South Park episode on South Park Studios , the official South Park website , which has all but 3 episodes of South Park to date available for viewing . 
 Both Kanye West and Carlos <unk> responded within one day of the episode 's original broadcast and said they enjoyed the parodies of themselves , although Kanye West said on his blog that his feelings were hurt . After the episode was broadcast , <unk> wrote on his Twitter feed , " They just made fun of me on South Park . I thought it was hysterical . <unk> the <unk> . " Dave <unk> , arts reporter for The New York Times , complimented <unk> for his response . West wrote on his blog , " South Park murdered me last night and it 's pretty damn funny . It <unk> my feelings but what can you expect from South Park ! " West thanked the South Park writers in his blog entry and acknowledged he has a problem with his ego , but said he was trying to change . Parker and Stone said they were extremely surprised by West 's reaction , and felt <unk> was treated far more harshly in the episode than West . Parker said , " It was like , <unk> , we just said you were a gay fish . What are you talking about ? It was so dumb . " 
 The episode received positive , if slightly mixed reviews . Ramsey <unk> of IGN declared it the best episode of the season , calling it a " beautiful Kanye West spoof that was so well @-@ timed , so hilarious and so spot @-@ on " that it became a " phenomenon " . Ryan <unk> of the New York Post said of the episode , " Best . ' South Park . ' Ever . " He particularly praised the West song parody and the fact that " a simple running joke can hold a full episode ; brilliant " . Carlos <unk> of If Magazine said the episode was " another South Park classic " which " takes full advantage of <unk> 's monumental ego " . <unk> , who gave the episode a B + grade , described the West parody as " awesome " and the final scene with the " gay fish " West song as " spell binding " . TV Guide listed the episode at number five on the top ten television moments of the week . 
 On September 13 , 2009 during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards , Kanye West interrupted an acceptance speech from Taylor Swift by walking onto stage , grabbing the microphone and praising her fellow nominee , Beyoncé Knowles . The incident received considerable press attention and drew further attention to " <unk> " , which Comedy Central re @-@ broadcast for two straight hours on September 15 , 2009 . 
 Kanye West referenced this episode in his song " <unk> " from the 2010 album My Beautiful Dark <unk> Fantasy where he says " <unk> a South Park writer with a <unk> " . He similarly referenced the episode on his album Watch the Throne in the song " Made in America " when he says " South Park had them all <unk> ' / Now all my <unk> designing and we all <unk> ' . " 
 Following a controversial 2008 performance at music festival <unk> , many <unk> have since <unk> graffiti around the festival grounds , as well as making signs , <unk> the rapper as a " gay fish . " 
 A <unk> called <unk> was created in January 2014 . Under legal pressure , the developers had to change the logo from resembling West to resembling " a half @-@ man @-@ half @-@ fish hybrid " instead . 
 " <unk> " , along with the thirteen other episodes from South Park 's thirteenth season , were released on a three @-@ disc DVD set and two @-@ disc Blu @-@ ray set in the United States on March 16 , 2010 . The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode , a collection of deleted scenes , and a special mini @-@ feature Inside Xbox : A Behind @-@ the @-@ Scenes Tour of South Park Studios , which discussed the process behind <unk> the show with Inside Xbox host Major Nelson . 
 <unk> <unk> ( February 22 , 1890 – October 10 , 1942 ) was a Venezuelan American actress during the silent film era , known at the time for her operatic soprano voice and appearances in musical theatre . She was one of the few <unk> stars visible on the silver screen in the United States in the <unk> . She was the leading lady in each film project she was involved in , and co @-@ founded a production company with her husband , producing four of her own movies . 
 She wrote popular articles for newspapers , including an advice column for girls , describing what it was like to be an actress , and answering questions from readers . For adult readers , <unk> wrote other pieces such as a history of the moving picture industry . In 1920 when she stopped making films , she returned to her career as a singer . 
 <unk> faded from historiography for many years , but her place in history has recently been re @-@ examined ; she was mentioned in 2002 in a presidential proclamation and her 1914 film <unk> Jane is enjoying a limited re @-@ release . 
 On Sunday , March 3 , 1907 , <unk> married George E. Middleton , a prominent San Francisco automobile dealer , the " happy culmination " of a romance that had begun in their school days . The private wedding took place at 232 <unk> Street , the home of the parents of <unk> Margaret <unk> , " a lifelong friend of the bride " . Judge Thomas F. Graham performed the ceremony . The couple spent a few weeks in Los Angeles for their honeymoon . 
 Middleton was the manager of the local Middleton Motor Car Company and the son of a California timber <unk> . He introduced <unk> to his society friends and business partners , including the trustees of Charles <unk> 's estate who had rebuilt the St. Francis Hotel after the 1906 earthquake and fire . 
 After two years spent absent from the stage , in October 1910 , " <unk> <unk> Middleton " received a " full ovation " at the <unk> Theater for her role in The White Hen , a musical comedy set in Austria . <unk> comedian Max <unk> , leader of the acting company , was the star of the show , given 14 minutes of applause upon entering the stage . For her performance , <unk> was sent flowers worth " a small fortune " , according to the San Francisco Call 's theater writer , Walter Anthony . Starring actress <unk> <unk> , native to San Francisco but unknown as a performer , took less applause . 
 Middleton and <unk> gave an interview to Anthony after The White Hen was an established hit . Middleton said that he had kept his wife off the stage , that he " didn 't like the idea of musical comedy " , but would not have objected to her appearance in " grand opera " . Nonetheless , he agreed to an offer from Max <unk> . <unk> said that she had so far spent her married life studying to perform three operatic roles : Carmen and <unk> in Carmen , and <unk> <unk> in La traviata . She said that prior to appearing at the <unk> Theater , she had been afraid that her stage training had been lost . <unk> said she had to overcome her own fears as well as her husband 's objections . 
 At the end of November , <unk> quit <unk> 's company , reporting that she had been billed underneath <unk> <unk> in theater publicity , against the arrangement she had made with company manager Nat A. <unk> . She said she refused to put her famous family name in second place . 
 On December 6 , 1910 , a story in the Call talked about <unk> and her sister having been " discovered " seven years previously by John Slocum , the manager who worked with the girls in the Princess <unk> company . According to the story , Slocum had been trying to get <unk> to sign a long @-@ term contract , but was beaten out in that regard by Middleton , " the athlete and <unk> about town " , whom she had married . A week earlier , <unk> had " caused a sensation " by resigning from the Max <unk> company , but subsequently agreed to appear for four performances in Slocum 's traveling production of The <unk> Girl , normally featuring <unk> 's good friend , the actress Texas Guinan , who was willing to step down for a few days while <unk> covered the starring role of Christina . <unk> was quoted as saying , 
 " Leo Cooper , seven years ago , insisted that Mr. Slocum should hear two youngsters sing . The youngsters were <unk> and myself . He was good enough to have confidence in us and gave us positions in his ' Princess <unk> ' company , where we rose afterward , through his encouragement and help , to <unk> <unk> posts . In memory of these <unk> of the past and because I love the work , I have been happy to say ' yes ' to his request that I appear with his company a few times for <unk> <unk> <unk> before ' The <unk> Girl ' goes on her <unk> way . " 
 Following the three performances in San Francisco and one in Oakland , <unk> and her husband took seats in the audience to watch Guinan perform the play 's title role in San Jose 's Victory Theater on December 15 . 
 <unk> excelled in a singing role in The <unk> @-@ <unk> Man of <unk> in 1913 . That year , during the autumn season , <unk> was a featured star of the <unk> ' Fair , an engineering and auto show in San Francisco . Following that , she sang at the inauguration of the Lincoln Highway , the nation 's first <unk> road . The western terminus celebration at the Valencia Theatre in San Francisco was organized by the Motor Car <unk> ' Association , October 31 , 1913 . 
 Middleton set up the California Motion Picture Company ( <unk> ) in San Rafael in 1912 for the purpose of shooting promotional footage of the automobiles he was selling . He determined that his pretty wife could star in movies made by his company . By 1914 , Middleton and <unk> were making three major films at the same time . 
 " <unk> of a renowned tenor of San Francisco 's pioneer days , herself a <unk> <unk> with an assured place on the modern operatic stage , a girl with a wealth of artistic tradition behind her , Miss <unk> 's gifts do not stop there . She has rare beauty , <unk> , wit , intellectual <unk> and athletic grace . " 
 One <unk> shooting location was on family property near Boulder Creek , California where Middleton 's father had established a timber holding now known as the Middleton <unk> . Other filming locations included undeveloped portions of <unk> , Santa Cruz and <unk> counties . In San Rafael , the studio boasted a large glass @-@ walled and <unk> building that let in light but not wind so that shooting for indoor scenes could take place in full light without the <unk> flapping of <unk> and clothing blown by gusts . Considered expensive at the time , the company used a US $ 1 @,@ 250 Bell & Howell movie camera , worth about $ 29 @,@ 200 in current value . The camera held two reels of film so that two <unk> were made of each scene . A second $ 700 camera provided a third reel of the same scene , from another perspective . 
 In 1915 and 1916 , <unk> wrote the regular newspaper column " <unk> with Screen @-@ struck Girls " , carried at first by the San Rafael Independent on <unk> but then appeared on Sundays in other newspapers : San Francisco <unk> and the <unk> Journal @-@ <unk> ( Arizona ) . She wrote about the ideal qualities found in an actress , and what girls might do to develop them . She received a <unk> of letters from readers — many were from girls asking " Must I be able to ride " and " Must I be able to swim " . In response , <unk> described in the column how those skills were helpful to a movie actress , but not absolutely necessary ; she said they " are accessories to , rather than the substance of the thing ... I would advise every girl entering motion pictures to learn to ride and swim and do all the rest of it , but I would have her realize their subordination to the really artistic side of the profession . " ' 
 On May 7 , 1916 , <unk> wrote to caution girls wishing for fame on the silver screen that many like themselves ended up " broken in spirit " , with shattered expectations . She advised them to stay home and avoid " bitter disappointment " in movie making . In July , she discussed some of the specifics of the mental challenges of acting : 
 " There are a hundred little <unk> that index the character of practically every type of person , and it is the effectiveness with which one <unk> , <unk> and utilizes these <unk> that makes him or her a great dramatic artist ... The truly great actress ... must not only recognize the traits as she sees them <unk> <unk> , but she must also get beneath the skin and recognize the conditions of thought or emotion that give rise to them . Then , and this is the really great test of her talents , she must so lose herself in those conditions of thought and emotion , and feel through them , that her mimicry of their outward manifestations comes naturally and without conscious endeavor . " 
 In addition to her column , <unk> wrote occasional articles intended for a wider readership . She wrote in October 1916 about the history of the moving picture industry in a multiple @-@ article series , beginning her account with a retelling of <unk> Muybridge 's action photograph of Governor <unk> Stanford 's racehorse named <unk> . She defined this high @-@ speed image as essential to the development of moving pictures . 
 Middleton and <unk> bought their bankrupt film company for " a few thousand dollars " in 1917 and renamed it <unk> Studios . Their new company was called <unk> <unk> Features , and shooting began on their next feature @-@ length film , Just <unk> . <unk> 's lead character was a white woman raised by American Indians , a woman who does not realize her racial heritage until after she falls into forbidden love with a white man . The movie played for only a week in San Francisco in 1919 , and did not return a profit . 
 The <unk> ' new distributor , Robertson @-@ Cole , was unable to find the right market for Heart of Juanita and The Flame of <unk> in 1920 . American audiences had grown more sophisticated , yet <unk> Studios was still employing their earlier production techniques . After shooting The Flame of <unk> , Middleton and <unk> stopped making movies altogether . She returned to her singing performances and he returned to his car sales . They reportedly divorced in the mid @-@ 1920s , though Middleton told the 1930 US Census that they were married . The union produced no children . 
 After leaving film work , <unk> continued with her singing career , and toured Latin America ( 1927 ) where she was warmly received as part of a 30 @-@ person troupe of singers and dancers performing the operas Carmen and <unk> Butterfly . The San Francisco Chronicle reported that this was " the first invasion of those countries by an American operatic star in repertoire performances " . Afterward , she retired from singing , and returned to San Rafael to live near her old film studio . Between 1937 and 1941 , she sold 10 of the 26 real estate <unk> that together had formed her studio lot . On October 10 , 1942 , after a surgical operation in San Francisco , she died at the age of 52 . Her sister <unk> <unk> and her ex @-@ husband George Middleton survived her . 
 The <unk> Features studio facility in San Rafael sat empty through the 1920s with its solitary metal @-@ clad brick vault housing all the company 's nitrate films , including the earlier ones shot by <unk> . In 1931 , boys playing with a <unk> at the deserted lot set the vault and all of its flammable contents <unk> on fire . Every known copy of <unk> 's movies was destroyed , a loss that Middleton estimated at $ 200 @,@ 000 ; worth about $ 3 @.@ 1 million today . In 1996 , an 82 @-@ year @-@ old nitrate copy of <unk> Jane was found in Australia ; it was sent to the Library of Congress for preservation . Awareness of <unk> 's contribution to early film , and her role as a groundbreaking Hispanic star , rose in 2002 with a proclamation made by President George W. Bush upon the occasion of National Hispanic Heritage Month in which he listed her as one of America 's influential Latino actors . In 2008 , a new print of <unk> Jane was released for limited distribution . 
 Louis Roy <unk> ( January 25 , 1924 – November 29 , 2000 ) , nicknamed " The <unk> " , was an American football <unk> and offensive tackle who played his entire career for the Cleveland Browns in the All @-@ America Football Conference ( <unk> ) and National Football League ( NFL ) . <unk> was professional football 's career kicking and points leader when he retired after the 1967 season . He played in 21 seasons for the Browns , helping the team to win eight league championships in that span . <unk> 's accuracy and strength as a kicker influenced the development of place @-@ kicking as a specialty ; he could kick field goals from beyond 50 yards ( 46 m ) at a time when attempts from that distance were a rarity .

 Born in eastern Ohio in <unk> Ferry , just north and across the Ohio River from <unk> , West Virginia , <unk> 's parents were immigrants from Transylvania , part of modern @-@ day Romania . His Hungarian mother Mary and Romanian father John ( <unk> ) <unk> owned and ran <unk> 's Tavern on Main Street .

The day he landed in the Philippines , <unk> saw a soldier shot in the face . He was stationed in a bank of tents about five miles from the front lines and helped doctors tend to the wounded . " I saw a lot of men wounded with severe injuries , " he later said . " <unk> legs , <unk> hanging out , stuff like that . It 's a tough thing , but you get hardened to it , and you accept it as part of your being there . " 
 While he was in the Army , he received a package from Paul Brown , the Ohio State football coach . It contained <unk> and a contract for him to sign to play on a team Brown was coaching in the new All @-@ America Football Conference ( <unk> ) . He signed the contract in May 1945 and agreed to join the team , called the Cleveland Browns , after the war ended in 1946 . <unk> got $ 500 a month <unk> until the end of the war and a $ 7 @,@ 500 annual salary . 
 The war had shortened <unk> 's college career , so he continued to study at Ohio State in the offseason in his early years with the Browns . He graduated with a degree in business in 1949 . <unk> married that year , to Jackie Lou <unk> , a girl from <unk> Ferry who was working as a model in New York City when they first dated . 
 The Browns ' debut in the NFL in the 1950 season was closely watched ; while the team dominated the <unk> in its short existence , some sportswriters , NFL owners and coaches considered the league inferior . Cleveland put all doubts to rest in its first game against the two @-@ time defending champion Philadelphia Eagles , winning 35 – 10 . In a game against the Washington <unk> later in the season , <unk> broke a 24 @-@ year @-@ old NFL record by kicking his 13th field goal of the season . He also scored the only touchdown of his career in that game on a reception from Graham . The Browns ended the regular season with a 10 – 2 record in the American Conference , tied with the New York Giants . That forced a playoff against the Giants in which <unk> kicked the winning field goal for the Browns with under a minute to play . 
 Cleveland again reached the championship game in 1951 , but lost this time in a rematch against the <unk> . <unk> had a 52 @-@ yard field goal in the game , a record for a championship or Super Bowl that stood for 42 years . He was again named to the Pro Bowl after the season .

Cleveland won the championship again in 1955 , beating the <unk> 38 – 14 . <unk> was named to the Pro Bowl and sportswriters ' All @-@ Pro teams in 1954 and 1955 . 
 Hurt by Graham 's retirement before the season , Cleveland had its first @-@ ever losing season in 1956 . <unk> 's kicking continued to be a strength through the ensuing three years : he reached the Pro Bowl in 1957 , 1958 and 1959 , and tied Sam Baker for league leader in points scored in 1957 . Cleveland reached the championship game in 1957 but lost to the Lions . The Browns lost to the New York Giants in a single @-@ elimination playoff in 1958 , and failed to reach the postseason in 1959 . <unk> sat out after the 1959 season due to a back injury and was presumed to be retired . While his kicking was his most visible contribution to the team , <unk> was also an offensive tackle up until his injury , when Brown replaced him with Dick <unk> . " Lou never got all the credit he deserved for his tackle play , probably because his great kicking skills got him more notoriety , " Andy <unk> , a defensive end who played against <unk> , later said . 
 <unk> took 1960 off and did some <unk> for the team . He also focused on an insurance business he started . " I was 36 and I thought I had retired , " he said . The following year , however , he came back to the team at the urging of Art <unk> , who bought the Browns that year . Not wanting to use a roster spot on a kicking specialist ( <unk> 's back injury prevented him from playing on the line ) , Brown had signed Sam Baker to kick and play <unk> . But <unk> was eager to return and <unk> insisted . <unk> stayed with the team as a <unk> until 1967 , and was on a Browns team that won the 1964 championship . <unk> scored the first points in that game on a third @-@ quarter field goal . He also kicked four kickoffs more than 70 yards ( 64 m ) and out of the Baltimore Colts end zone , preventing a return . Cleveland won 27 – 0 .

He was offered a spot with the Browns as a kicking coach , helping mentor the young Don <unk> , but he declined . Later in life , he became an ambassador and father figure for the Browns , inviting <unk> over for dinner and helping them find apartments .

 <unk> relocated the Browns to Baltimore in 1995 and renamed the team the <unk> , provoking a wave of anger and <unk> from fans and former players . <unk> was a leading critic of the move , saying it was " like some man walking off with your wife .

Following <unk> 's death , the Browns wore his number 76 on their helmets for the 2001 season . 
 While field goals had long been viewed as an important part of football strategy , kicking specialists were a rarity before <unk> 's time . <unk> 's success from distances of 40 yards ( 37 m ) and beyond raised the bar for <unk> across the league . He set single @-@ season NFL records for accuracy , distance and number of field goals in his first three years in the league , marks that went unbeaten until kicking specialists became a common feature of the game in the early 1970s . <unk> 's kicking was the difference in 15 % of the Browns ' games during the <unk> years , and teams began to take notice when his field goals made the difference in both the NFL playoffs and the championship game in 1950 . " Everybody started to pay attention to field goals when the Browns started to win games with them , " Pat <unk> said . <unk> led the NFL in field goals made five times in his career . 
 <unk> was a straight @-@ ahead kicker . He approached the football in a straight line and <unk> it with the top of his foot , aiming for the middle of the ball . Early in his career , <unk> <unk> the ground with his <unk> in a straight line to help guide his kicks . Later he put down a piece of one @-@ inch <unk> tape rolled up inside his helmet . The " Lou <unk> Rule " in 1950 banned the use of artificial kicking aids , including the tape . The straight @-@ ahead style used by <unk> and other <unk> of his era has since been <unk> by soccer @-@ style kicking with the side of the foot . " I don 't know why all the kids kick soccer @-@ style , " he said in 1997 . " They kick the ball with the side of their foot , which is supposed to give them better control .

However , in the subsequent week of practice for the January 30 , 2010 Senior Bowl , Schofield tore his anterior <unk> ligament . 
 Schofield was drafted in the 4th round of the 2010 NFL Draft , 130th overall , by the Arizona Cardinals . Since Schofield was injured , he was considered a good value because his talent level was near first round draft choice level . He was expected to begin the 2010 NFL season on the physically unable to perform list but return late in the year as an outside linebacker . Although he played on the defensive line in college , he was projected to play outside linebacker for the Cardinals who had Joey Porter and Will Davis on their roster .

 Schofield is the eldest of five children of Anthony and Dawn Schofield . Younger brother Admiral Schofield plays basketball at the University of Tennessee . His uncle Andre Carter played safety at Clemson . Schofield is a cousin of both <unk> Holliday and Bobby <unk> who both have had long National Football League careers . 
 The Paralympics has grown from a small gathering of British World War II veterans in 1948 to become one of the largest international sporting events by the early 21st century . <unk> strive for equal treatment with non @-@ disabled Olympic athletes , but there is a large funding gap between Olympic and Paralympic athletes . 
 The Paralympic Games are organized in parallel with the Olympic Games , while the IOC @-@ recognized Special Olympics World Games include athletes with intellectual disabilities , and the <unk> include <unk> athletes . 
 Given the wide variety of disabilities that Paralympic athletes have , there are several categories in which the athletes compete . The <unk> disabilities are broken down into ten eligible <unk> types . The categories are impaired muscle power , impaired passive range of movement , limb <unk> , leg length difference , short stature , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , vision <unk> and intellectual <unk> . These categories are further broken down into classifications , which vary from sport to sport . The classification system has led to cheating controversies revolving around athletes who over @-@ stated their disabilities , in addition to the use of performance @-@ enhancing drugs seen in other events . 
 Athletes with disabilities did compete in the Olympic Games prior to the advent of the Paralympics . The first athlete to do so was German American <unk> George <unk> in 1904 , who had one artificial leg . Hungarian <unk> <unk> competed in shooting events in both the 1948 and 1952 Summer Olympics . He was a right @-@ arm <unk> and could shoot left @-@ handed . Another disabled athlete to appear in the Olympics prior to the Paralympic Games was <unk> <unk> , a Danish <unk> athlete who had contracted <unk> in 1943 and won a silver medal in the <unk> event . 
 The first organized athletic day for disabled athletes that coincided with the Olympic Games took place on the day of the opening of the 1948 Summer Olympics in London , United Kingdom . German born Dr. Ludwig <unk> of Stoke <unk> Hospital , who had been helped to flee Nazi Germany by the Council for <unk> <unk> Academics ( <unk> ) in 1939 , hosted a sports competition for British World War II veteran patients with spinal <unk> injuries . The first games were called the 1948 International Wheelchair Games , and were intended to coincide with the 1948 Olympics . Dr. <unk> 's aim was to create an elite sports competition for people with disabilities that would be equivalent to the Olympic Games . The games were held again at the same location in 1952 , and Dutch veterans took part alongside the British , making it the first international competition of its kind . These early competitions , also known as the Stoke <unk> Games , have been described as the precursors of the Paralympic Games . 
 There have been several milestones in the Paralympic movement . The first official Paralympic Games , no longer open solely to war veterans , was held in Rome in 1960 . 400 athletes from 23 countries competed at the 1960 Games . Since 1960 , the Paralympic Games have taken place in the same year as the Olympic Games . The Games were initially open only to athletes in <unk> ; at the 1976 Summer Games , athletes with different disabilities were included for the first time at a Summer Paralympics . With the inclusion of more disability classifications the 1976 Summer Games expanded to 1 @,@ 600 athletes from 40 countries . The 1988 Summer Paralympics in Seoul , South Korea , was another milestone for the Paralympic movement . It was in Seoul that the Paralympic Summer Games were held directly after the Olympic Summer Games , in the same host city , and using the same facilities . This set a precedent that was followed in 1992 , 1996 and 2000 . It was eventually formalized in an agreement between the International Paralympic Committee ( IPC ) and the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) in 2001 , and was recently extended through <unk> . The 1992 Winter Paralympics were the first Winter Games to use the same facilities as the Winter Olympics . 
 The first Winter Paralympic Games were held in 1976 in <unk> , Sweden . This was the first Paralympics in which multiple categories of athletes with disabilities could compete . The Winter Games were celebrated every four years on the same year as their summer counterpart , just as the Olympics were . This tradition was upheld until the 1992 Games in <unk> , France ; after that , beginning with the 1994 Games , the Winter Paralympics and the Winter Olympics have been held in those even numbered years separate from the Summer Games . 
 The Paralympic games were designed to emphasize the participants ' athletic achievements and not their disability . Recent games have emphasized that these games are about ability and not disability . The movement has grown dramatically since its early days – for example , the number of athletes participating in the Summer Paralympic games has increased from 400 athletes in Rome in 1960 to over 3 @,@ 900 athletes from 146 countries in Beijing in 2008 . Both the Paralympic Summer and Winter Games are recognized on the world stage . The Paralympics is no longer held solely for British war veterans or just for athletes in <unk> , but for elite athletes with a wide variety of disabilities from all over the world . The <unk> allow people with special needs a chance to heal their injuries and take part in the games . 
 The first organization dedicated to advancement of athletic opportunities for people with a disability was the International Sports Organization for the <unk> ( <unk> ) , founded in 1964 . The founders of this organization intended it to be a governing body to disability sports what the IOC was to the Olympic Games . This committee eventually became the International <unk> Committee of World Sports <unk> for the <unk> ( ICC ) , which was established in 1982 . The ICC was tasked with advocating for the rights of athletes with a disability in front of the IOC . After the success of the cooperative effort between the ICC and the IOC , which resulted in the 1988 Summer Paralympics in Seoul , the ICC determined the need to expand and include representatives from all nations that had disability sports programs . They also deemed it necessary to include athletes in the decisions of the Paralympic governing body . Consequently , this body was reorganized as the International Paralympic Committee ( IPC ) in 1989 . 
 The IPC has a cooperative relationship with the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) . <unk> of the IPC are also members of the IOC and participate on IOC committees and commissions . The two governing bodies remain distinct , with separate Games , despite the close working relationship . 
 Although the name was originally coined as a <unk> combining " <unk> " ( due to its origins as games for people with spinal injuries ) and " Olympic , " the inclusion of other disability groups meant that this was no longer considered very accurate . The present formal explanation for the name is that it derives from the Greek <unk> <unk> , <unk> ( " beside " or " alongside " ) and thus refers to a competition held in parallel with the Olympic Games . The Summer Games of 1988 held in Seoul was the first time the term " Paralympic " came into official use . 
 “ Spirit in Motion ” is the motto for the Paralympic movement . The symbol for the Paralympics contains three colours , red , blue , and green , which are the colours most widely represented in the flags of nations . The colours are each in the shape of an <unk> ( which is Latin for " I move " ) , which is the name given to an asymmetrical crescent specially designed for the Paralympic movement . The three <unk> circle a central point , which is a symbol for the athletes <unk> from all points of the globe . The motto and symbol of the IPC were changed in 2003 to their current versions . The change was intended to convey the idea that <unk> have a spirit of competition and that the IPC as an organization realizes its potential and is moving forward to achieve it . The vision of the IPC is , " To enable Paralympic athletes to achieve sporting excellence and to inspire and excite the world . " The Paralympic anthem is " Hymn de l <unk> " or " Anthem of the Future " . It was composed by <unk> <unk> and adopted as the official anthem in March 1996 . 
 As mandated by the Paralympic Charter , various elements frame the opening ceremony of the Paralympic Games . Most of these rituals were established at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp . The ceremony typically starts with the hoisting of the host country 's flag and a performance of its national anthem . Unlike the Olympic Games , after the national anthem , the athletes parade into the stadium grouped by <unk> the 1994 Winter <unk> nations enter the stadium <unk> according to the host country 's chosen language , though with the host country 's athletes being the last to enter . Since the 1988 Summer Paralympics , the host nation presents artistic displays of music , singing , dance , and theatre representative of its culture . 
 <unk> are given , formally opening the games . Finally , the Paralympic torch is brought into the stadium and passed on until it reaches the final torch carrier — often a Paralympic athlete from the host nation — who lights the Paralympic flame in the stadium 's cauldron . 
 The closing ceremony of the Paralympic Games takes place after all sporting events have concluded . Flag @-@ bearers from each participating country enter , followed by the athletes who enter together , without any national distinction . The Paralympic flag is taken down . Since the 2002 Winter Paralympics the national flag of the country hosting the next Summer or Winter Paralympic Games is <unk> while the corresponding national anthem is played . The games are officially closed , and the Paralympic flame is <unk> . After these compulsory elements , the next host nation briefly introduces itself with artistic displays of dance and theater representative of its culture . 
 A medal ceremony is held after each Paralympic event is concluded . The winner , second and third @-@ place competitors or teams stand on top of a three @-@ tiered <unk> to be awarded their respective medals . After the medals are given out by an IPC member , the national flags of the three <unk> are raised while the national anthem of the gold <unk> country plays . <unk> citizens of the host country also act as hosts during the medal ceremonies , as they aid the officials who present the medals and act as flag @-@ bearers . For every Paralympic event , the respective medal ceremony is held , at most , one day after the event 's final . 
 In 2001 the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the International Paralympic Committee ( IPC ) signed an agreement which guaranteed that host cities would be contracted to manage both the Olympic and Paralympic Games . This agreement was to remain in effect until the 2012 Summer Olympics , but was extended , encompassing all Summer and Winter games up until the <unk> Summer Olympics . 
 The IOC has written its commitment to equal access to athletics for all people into its charter , which states , 
 While the charter is silent on discrimination specifically related to disability ; given the language in the charter regarding discrimination it is reasonable to <unk> that discrimination on the basis of disability would be against the ideals of the Olympic Charter and the IOC . This is also consistent with the Paralympic Charter , which forbids discrimination on the basis of political , religious , economic , disability , gender , sexual orientation or racial reasons . 
 Chairman of the London organising committee , Sebastian Coe , said about the 2012 Summer Paralympics and 2012 Summer Olympics in London , England , that 
 The 2014 Winter Paralympic Games is the first such Paralympics hosted by Russia . Russia ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with <unk> during that period . Notably at 2010 Vancouver their Paralympic team topped the medal table at the Winter Paralympics , while their Olympic team performed well below expectations at the Winter Olympics . This led the media to highlight the contrast between the achievements of the country 's Olympic and Paralympic <unk> , despite the greater attention and funding awarded to the Olympic athletes . The Russian Federation organizers of the 2014 Winter Paralympic Games have , since 2007 , made efforts to make the host city <unk> more accessible . 
 Paralympic athletes have sought equal opportunities to compete at the Olympic Games . The precedent was set by <unk> <unk> , a Paralympic archer from New Zealand , who competed at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles . 
 In 2008 Oscar <unk> , a South African <unk> , attempted to qualify for the 2008 Summer Olympics . <unk> had both his legs amputated below the knee and races with two carbon fibre <unk> manufactured by <unk> . He holds Paralympic world record in the 400 meter event . <unk> missed qualifying for the 2008 Summer Olympics in the 400 meter race , by 0 @.@ 70 seconds . He qualified for the 2008 Summer Paralympics where he won gold medals in the 100 , 200 , and 400 meter sprints . In 2011 , <unk> qualified for the 2012 Summer Olympics and competed in two events : he made the semi @-@ final in the 400 metres race ; and his team came 8th in the final of the 4 × 400 metres relay race . 
 Some athletes without a disability also compete at the Paralympics ; The sighted guides for athletes with a visual <unk> are such a close and essential part of the competition that the athlete with visual <unk> and the guide are considered a team , and both athletes are medal candidates . 
 As with the Olympics , recent Paralympics have also been supported by contributions from major sponsors . Unlike the Olympics , where the IOC <unk> that arenas be clean of sponsor <unk> , the Paralympics do allow the <unk> of official sponsors to be displayed inside arenas and on uniforms . 
 While the Olympic Games have experienced tremendous growth in global media coverage since the 1984 Summer Olympics , the Paralympics have been unable to maintain a consistent international media presence . 
 Television broadcasts of Paralympic Games began in 1976 , but this early coverage was confined to taped @-@ delay releases to one nation or region . At the 1992 Summer Paralympics there were 45 hours of live coverage but it was available only in Europe . Other countries broadcast highlight packages during the Games . No meaningful improvements in coverage occurred until the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney . 
 The 2000 Paralympics represented a significant increase in global media exposure for the Paralympic Games . A deal was reached between the Sydney Paralympic <unk> Committee ( <unk> ) and All Media Sports ( <unk> ) to broadcast the Games internationally . <unk> were reached with Asian , South American , and European broadcast companies to distribute coverage to as many markets as possible . The Games were also <unk> for the first time . Because of these efforts the Sydney Paralympics reached a global audience estimated at 300 million people . Also significant was the fact that the organizers did not have to pay networks to <unk> the Games as had been done at the 1992 and 1996 Games . Despite these advances consistent media attention has been a challenge , which was evidenced in the coverage in Great Britain of the 2010 Winter Paralympics . 
 The British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) was criticized for its minimal coverage of the 2010 Winter Paralympics as compared to its coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics . The BBC announced it would stream some content on its website and show a one @-@ hour highlight program after the Games ended . For the Winter Olympics the BBC aired 160 hours of coverage . The response from the BBC was that budget constraints and the " time zone factor " necessitated a limited broadcast schedule . The reduction in coverage was done in spite of increased ratings for the 2008 Summer Paralympics , which was watched by 23 % of the population of Great Britain . In Norway , the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation ( <unk> ) broadcast 30 hours of the 2010 Winter Games live . <unk> @-@ sport were critical of parts of the TV production from Vancouver , and notified the <unk> of issues such as the <unk> coverage excluding the shooting , and cross @-@ country skiing with <unk> in the distance , making it hard to follow the progress of the competition . <unk> were far more pleased with the production of the ice <unk> hockey and wheelchair curling events , which they felt reached the same level as the Olympic Games . 
 Commercial broadcaster Channel 4 acquired the rights to the Paralympics in the United Kingdom for the 2012 Summer Paralympics , and planned to air extensive coverage of the games ; Channel 4 aired 150 hours of coverage , and also offered mobile <unk> , and three dedicated streaming channels of additional coverage on Sky , <unk> , Virgin Media and Channel 4 's website . " Channel 4 also made a push to <unk> the profile of the Paralympics in the country by producing a 2 minute trailer for its coverage , " Meet the <unk> " ; which <unk> simultaneously on over 70 commercial channels in the UK on 17 July 2012 . Channel 4 have also acquired the rights to the 2014 Winter Paralympics and the 2016 Summer Paralympics . 
 American broadcaster NBC Sports , who also owns the broadcast rights to the Olympics , has been criticised by athletes and IPC officials for airing only a bare minimum of coverage from the Paralympics ; the lack of coverage from NBC in Athens was a cause for concern from senior IPC officials , especially given that the United States was bidding for the 2012 Games . In 2012 NBC only produced around 5 hours of tape delayed highlights from the Games , airing on the pay TV channel NBC Sports Network , and did not cover the ceremonies at all . 
 IPC president Philip <unk> was vocal about NBC 's reluctance to air coverage in 2012 , expressing his disappointment for American athletes and viewers who would miss the " amazing images " the games would bring , and remarking that " some people think that North America always lead [ s ] on everything , and on this they don 't . It 's about time they caught up . " Following the closing ceremonies , <unk> hinted that the IPC might put greater scrutiny on broadcasters at future editions of the Paralympics ( or may strip NBC of its broadcast rights ) , by stating that " if we find our values don ’ t fit , we ’ ll have to go somewhere else . " NBC would pick up broadcast rights to the 2014 and 2016 Paralympics , promising a significantly larger amount of coverage than before . 
 A 2010 study by the University of British Columbia ( <unk> ) on the Olympic Games Impact ( <unk> ) , showed that of roughly 1 @,@ 600 Canadian <unk> , 41 – 50 percent believed the 2010 Paralympic and Olympic Games in Vancouver , Canada triggered additional accessibility of buildings , <unk> and public spaces . 23 percent of employers said the Games had increased their willingness to hire people with disabilities . 
 Chief Executive Officer for the International Paralympic Committee , Xavier Gonzalez , said about the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing , China , that 
 The International Paralympic Committee ( IPC ) has established ten disability categories . Athletes are divided within each category according to their level of <unk> , in a functional classification system which differs from sport to sport . 
 The IPC has established ten disability categories , including physical , visual , and intellectual <unk> . Athletes with one of these disabilities can compete in the Paralympics though not every sport can allow for every disability category . These categories apply to both Summer and Winter Paralympics . 
 <unk> muscle power - With <unk> in this category , the force generated by muscles , such as the muscles of one limb , one side of the body or the lower half of the body is reduced , e.g. due to spinal @-@ <unk> injury , <unk> <unk> or <unk> . 
 <unk> passive range of movement - Range of movement in one or more joints is reduced in a systematic way . Acute conditions such as <unk> are not included . 
 Loss of limb or limb <unk> - A total or partial absence of bones or joints from partial or total loss due to illness , trauma , or congenital limb <unk> ( e.g. <unk> ) . 
 Leg @-@ length difference - Significant bone <unk> occurs in one leg due to congenital <unk> or trauma . 
 Short stature - Standing height is reduced due to shortened legs , arms and trunk , which are due to a <unk> deficit of bone or cartilage structures . 
 <unk> - <unk> is marked by an abnormal increase in muscle tension and reduced ability of a muscle to stretch . <unk> may result from injury , disease , or conditions which involve damage to the central nervous system ( e.g. <unk> <unk> ) . 
 <unk> - <unk> is an <unk> that consists of a lack of coordination of muscle movements ( e.g. <unk> <unk> , <unk> ’ s <unk> ) . 
 <unk> - <unk> is generally characterized by <unk> , <unk> movements and a difficulty maintaining a symmetrical posture ( e.g. <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) . 
 Visual <unk> - Athletes with visual <unk> ranging from partial vision , sufficient to be judged legally blind , to total blindness . This includes <unk> of one or more component of the visual system ( eye structure , receptors , <unk> <unk> pathway , and visual cortex ) . The sighted guides for athletes with a visual <unk> are such a close and essential part of the competition that the athlete with visual <unk> and the guide are considered a team . Beginning in 2012 , these guides ( along with sighted <unk> in 5 @-@ a @-@ side football became eligible to receive medals of their own . 
 <unk> <unk> - Athletes with a significant <unk> in intellectual functioning and associated limitations in adaptive behaviour . The IPC primarily serves athletes with physical disabilities , but the disability group <unk> <unk> has been added to some Paralympic Games . This includes only elite athletes with intellectual disabilities diagnosed before the age of 18 . However , the IOC @-@ recognized Special Olympics World Games are open to all people with intellectual disabilities . 
 Within the disability categories the athletes still need to be divided according to level of <unk> . The classification systems differ from sport to sport and are intended to open up sports to as many athletes as possible who can participate in fair competitions against athletes with similar levels of ability . The biggest challenge in the classification system is how to account for the wide variety and severity of disabilities . Consequently , there is a range of <unk> within most classifications . 
 From its inception until the 1980s , the Paralympic system for classifying athletes consisted of a medical evaluation and diagnosis of <unk> . An athlete 's medical condition was the only factor used to determine what class they competed in . For example , an athlete who had a spinal <unk> injury that resulted in lower limb <unk> , would not compete in the same wheelchair race as an athlete with a double above @-@ knee <unk> . The fact that their disability caused the same <unk> did not factor into classification determination , the only consideration was their medical diagnosis . It was not until views on disabled athletics shifted from just a form of rehabilitation to an end in itself , that the classification system changed from medical diagnosis to a focus on the functional abilities of the athlete . 
 While there is no clear date when the shift occurred , a functional classification system became the norm for disabled athletic classification in the 1980s . In a functional system the focus is on what effect the athlete 's <unk> has on his or her athletic performance . Under this system , athletes with total loss of function in their legs will compete together in most sports , because their functional loss is the same and the reason for the loss is <unk> . The only exception to the functional system is the classification format used by International Blind Sport Federation ( <unk> ) , which still uses a <unk> based system . 
 Some sports are only held for certain disability types . For example , goalball is only for visually impaired athletes . The Paralympics recognizes three different grades of visual <unk> , consequently all competitors in goalball must wear a visor or " black out mask " so that athletes with less visual <unk> will not have an advantage . Other sports , like athletics , are open to athletes with a wide variety of <unk> . In athletics participants are broken down into a range of classes based on the disability they have and then they are placed in a classification within that range based on their level of <unk> . For example : classes 11 – 13 are for visually impaired athletes , which class they are in depends on their level of visual <unk> . There are also team competitions such as wheelchair rugby . Members of the team are each given a point value based on their activity limitation . A lower score indicates a more severe activity limitation than a higher score . A team cannot have more than a certain maximum total of points on the field of play at the same time to ensure equal competition . For example , in wheelchair rugby the five players ' combined disability number must total no more than eight points . 
 The Paralympics have also been <unk> by steroid use . At the 2008 Games in Beijing , three <unk> and a German basketball player were banned after having tested positive for banned substances . This was a decrease in comparison to the ten <unk> and one track athlete who were banned from the 2000 Games . German <unk> Thomas <unk> became the first Winter <unk> to test positive for steroids . He had won two gold medals at the 2002 Winter Paralympics , but his medals were stripped after his positive drug test . At the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver , Swedish <unk> Glenn <unk> tested positive for a banned substance and was suspended for six months by the IPC . He was removed from the rest of the curling competition but his team was allowed to continue . The 54 @-@ year @-@ old <unk> said his doctor had prescribed a medication on the banned substances list . 
 Another concern now facing Paralympic officials is the technique of " <unk> " . Athletes can artificially increase their blood pressure , often by self @-@ <unk> , which has been shown to improve performance by up to 15 % . This is most effective in the endurance sports such as cross @-@ country skiing . To increase blood pressure athletes will deliberately cause trauma to limbs below a spinal injury . This trauma can include breaking bones , <unk> <unk> in too tightly , and using high @-@ pressured compression <unk> . The injury is <unk> but it does affect the athlete 's blood pressure . 
 Another potential concern is the use of gene therapy among Paralympic athletes . All Paralympic athletes are banned from enhancing their abilities through gene doping , but it is extremely difficult to differentiate these concepts . The World Anti @-@ Doping Agency is currently researching both gene doping and gene therapy , in part to <unk> the boundary between the two closely related concepts . 
 The IPC have been working with the World Anti @-@ Doping Agency since 2003 , to ensure compliance with <unk> 's anti @-@ doping code among its Paralympic athletes . The IPC has also promised to continue increasing the number of athletes tested at each of its Games , in order to further minimize the possible effect of doping in Paralympic sports . Mandatory <unk> and out @-@ of competition testing has also been implemented by the IPC to further ensure all of its athletes are performing in compliance with <unk> regulations . 
 Maya <unk> ( born 20 December 1990 ) is a 2 @.@ 5 point wheelchair basketball player , who played with the German national team that won a gold medal at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London . It also won a European title in 2011 and was runner @-@ up in 2013 . President Joachim <unk> awarded the team Germany 's highest sporting honour , the <unk> <unk> ( Silver Laurel Leaf ) . 
 Maya <unk> was born in Hamburg on 20 December 1990 . In 2004 , she <unk> one morning with severe back pain , and within hours she could no longer move her legs . Doctors diagnosed spinal <unk> inflammation . She is studying to be an occupational therapist at the <unk> <unk> Hospital in Hamburg <unk> . She began playing wheelchair basketball for fun at the hospital in 2005 . In 2009 , she was selected as part of the national team . 
 <unk> as a 2 @.@ 5 point player , <unk> plays power forward . She was part of the team that won the European Championships in Nazareth , Israel , in 2011 , thereby qualifying for the 2012 Summer Paralympic Games in London .

 The North American <unk> @-@ 21 , also known by the manufacturer 's model designation <unk> @-@ 21 , and sometimes referred to by the name " Dragon " , was a prototype bomber aircraft developed by North American Aviation in the late 1930s , for evaluation by the United States Army Air Corps . <unk> against the Douglas B @-@ 18 <unk> , it was found to be considerably more expensive than the rival aircraft , and despite the ordering of a small number of evaluation aircraft , only the prototype was ever built . 
 North American Aviation 's first twin @-@ engined military aircraft , the <unk> @-@ 21 prototype was constructed at North American 's factory in <unk> , California , where work on the aircraft began in early 1936 . The <unk> @-@ 21 was a mid @-@ wing <unk> of all @-@ metal construction , powered by two Pratt & Whitney R @-@ <unk> @-@ A Twin <unk> radial engines , which were fitted with <unk> for increased high @-@ altitude performance . 
 <unk> by a crew of six to eight men , the <unk> @-@ 21 featured a remarkably strong defensive armament for the time , including as many as five <unk> @-@ calibre <unk> machine guns . These were planned to be fitted in <unk> powered nose and dorsal turrets , in addition to manually operated weapons installed in waist and ventral positions . Up to 10 @,@ 000 pounds ( 4 @,@ 500 kg ) of bombs could be carried in an internal bomb bay , with 2 @,@ 200 pounds ( 1 @,@ 000 kg ) of bombs being able to be carried over a range of 1 @,@ 900 miles ( 3 @,@ 100 km ) . 
 <unk> its maiden flight on 22 December 1936 at <unk> Field , company test flying indicated a number of minor problems . <unk> resolving these resulted in the aircraft being re @-@ designated <unk> @-@ 39 , and , accepted by the U.S. Army Air Corps as the <unk> @-@ 21 . The aircraft , which had been assigned the serial number 38 @-@ <unk> , was evaluated early the following year in competition against a similar design by Douglas Aircraft , an improved version of the company 's successful B @-@ 18 <unk> . 
 During the course of the fly @-@ off , the gun turrets proved troublesome , their drive <unk> proving to be <unk> , and issues with wind blast through the gun slots were also encountered . As a result of these problems , the <unk> @-@ 21 's nose turret was <unk> over , while the dorsal turret was removed . 
 The <unk> @-@ 21 proved to have superior performance over its competitor , but price became the primary factor distinguishing the <unk> and the <unk> @-@ 21 . On this account , the modified B @-@ 18 was declared the winner of the competition , Douglas quoting a price per aircraft of $ 64 @,@ 000 USD , while North American 's estimate was $ 122 @,@ 000 USD per aircraft , and an order was placed for 177 of the Douglas aircraft , to be designated B @-@ <unk> . 
 Despite this , the Army Air Corps found the performance of the <unk> @-@ 21 to have been favorable enough to order five pre @-@ production aircraft , to be designated <unk> @-@ 21 . However , soon after this contract was awarded , it was cancelled , and none of the <unk> @-@ <unk> were ever built , leaving the <unk> @-@ 21 as the sole example of the type ever constructed . <unk> by North American Aviation , the <unk> @-@ 21 served as a research aircraft until its retirement . 
 Although the <unk> @-@ 21 failed to win a production contract , it was the first of a long line of North American Aviation medium bomber aircraft , and provided experience and knowledge that assisted in the development of the North American <unk> @-@ 40 , which , developed into the B @-@ 25 Mitchell , would become one of the Army 's standard medium bombers of World War II .

 Interstate 95 ( I @-@ 95 ) is an Interstate highway running along the East Coast of the United States from Miami , Florida north to the Canadian border in <unk> , Maine . In the state of Delaware , the route runs for 23 @.@ 43 mi ( 37 @.@ 71 km ) across the Wilmington area in northern New Castle County from the Maryland state line near Newark northeast to the Pennsylvania state line in <unk> . I @-@ 95 is the only primary ( 2 @-@ digit ) Interstate highway that enters Delaware , although it also has two auxiliary routes within the state ( I @-@ 295 and I @-@ 495 ) . Between the Maryland border and Newport , I @-@ 95 follows the Delaware Turnpike or John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway , a toll road with a toll plaza near the state line . In Newport , the <unk> has a large interchange with Delaware Route 141 ( DE 141 ) and the southern <unk> of I @-@ 295 and I @-@ 495 , the latter <unk> providing a bypass of Wilmington . I @-@ 95 heads north through the heart of Wilmington concurrent with U.S. Route 202 ( US 202 ) on the Wilmington Expressway . Past Wilmington , I @-@ 95 continues northeast to <unk> , where I @-@ 495 rejoins the route right before the Pennsylvania state line . 
 Plans for a road along the I @-@ 95 corridor through Wilmington to the Pennsylvania border predate the Interstate Highway System . After the Delaware Memorial Bridge was built in 1951 , the Delaware Turnpike was proposed between the bridge approach in <unk> and the Maryland border near Newark in order to alleviate traffic congestion on parallel US 40 . With the creation of the Interstate Highway System in 1956 , both these roads were incorporated into I @-@ 95 . Construction on the Delaware Turnpike began in 1957 and ended in 1963 . Construction on building I @-@ 95 through Wilmington began in the early 1960s . I @-@ 95 was completed north from Newport to downtown Wilmington in 1966 and north to the Pennsylvania border in 1968 . Between 1978 and 1980 , I @-@ 95 was temporarily rerouted along the I @-@ 495 bypass route while the South Wilmington Viaduct was reconstructed ; during this time the route through Wilmington was designated as I @-@ 895 . <unk> continue to be made to the highway including widening projects and reconstruction of sections of the road and interchanges . 
 I @-@ 95 enters Delaware from Maryland southwest of Newark in New Castle County . From the state line , the highway heads east as the six @-@ lane Delaware Turnpike ( John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway ) through wooded areas . Not far from the Maryland border , the road comes to a toll plaza . I @-@ 95 <unk> to eight lanes and comes to a modified cloverleaf interchange with DE <unk> , which heads north to Newark and the University of Delaware and south to US <unk> . Following this interchange , the <unk> highway runs between industrial areas to the north and farm fields to the south , coming to bridges over Norfolk Southern 's <unk> Secondary railroad line and DE 72 . The road heads through more woodland with nearby suburban development as it curves northeast , with the median widening for the Delaware Welcome Center service plaza accessible from both directions . A short distance later , I @-@ 95 reaches the DE 273 interchange west of Christiana . The freeway continues northeast and comes to a modified cloverleaf interchange with the DE 1 / DE 7 freeway to the northwest of the Christiana Mall . This interchange has flyover ramps between southbound I @-@ 95 and southbound DE 1 / DE 7 and northbound DE 1 / DE 7 and northbound I @-@ 95 ; the northbound ramp splits onto both sides of the northbound lanes of I @-@ 95 . 
 Past this interchange , I @-@ 95 <unk> to ten lanes and passes under DE 58 , with a ramp from southbound I @-@ 95 to westbound DE 58 that provides the missing connection between southbound I @-@ 95 and northbound DE 7 . The highway continues through woods before passing through <unk> 's Marsh , where it crosses the Christina River . After this bridge , I @-@ 95 has a northbound ramp to Airport Road that serves to provide access to southbound US 202 / DE 141 . At this point , the lanes of the <unk> split further apart and the northbound ramp for I @-@ 295 and northbound DE 141 splits off to parallel the northbound lanes of I @-@ 95 . The ramp to northbound I @-@ 295 has two lanes while northbound I @-@ 95 carries four lanes . After this , I @-@ 95 crosses US 202 / DE 141 , at which point US 202 becomes concurrent with the <unk> . Upon crossing DE 141 , the ramp to northbound DE 141 from the northbound I @-@ 295 ramp splits off while the ramp from DE 141 to northbound I @-@ 95 <unk> in from the left . <unk> , a collector / distributor ramp serves to provide access between I @-@ 95 and DE 141 . Not far after encountering DE 141 , I @-@ 295 splits off to the southeast , with the northbound entrance from I @-@ 295 and the southbound exit to I @-@ 295 and southbound entrance from I @-@ 295 on the left side of the road . At this point , the Delaware Turnpike splits from I @-@ 95 and follows I @-@ 295 southeast to an interchange with US 13 / US 40 in <unk> , where the turnpike ends and I @-@ 295 continues east as the Delaware Memorial Bridge approach . After I @-@ 295 , I @-@ 95 / US 202 turns north and comes to a northbound exit and southbound entrance with the southern terminus of I @-@ 495 , which bypasses Wilmington to the east . 
 Following the I @-@ 495 interchange , the median <unk> and I @-@ 95 / US 202 heads northeast through <unk> as the six @-@ lane Wilmington Expressway , crossing the Christina River . The freeway comes to a bridge over Norfolk Southern 's <unk> Branch and continues through more wetlands , with Amtrak 's Northeast Corridor running a short distance to the northwest . The road heads into Wilmington and curves to the north , passing to the west of <unk> Stadium , home of the Wilmington Blue Rocks baseball team . I @-@ 95 / US 202 heads towards downtown Wilmington and crosses onto a viaduct , passing over the Northeast Corridor and coming to an interchange that provides access to the downtown area by way of DE 4 and DE 48 . At this point , the four @-@ lane freeway continues northeast , with one @-@ way northbound North Adams Street to the east and one @-@ way southbound North Jackson Street to the west serving as frontage roads . I @-@ 95 / US 202 continues through residential areas to the west of downtown Wilmington , passing over DE 9 , with a southbound exit . Farther northeast , the freeway heads into an alignment below street level and comes to an interchange with DE 52 . Past this interchange , the road heads to the north and crosses Brandywine Creek , heading through Brandywine Park , which is a part of the Wilmington State Parks complex . The freeway curves northeast again and passes under <unk> 's Philadelphia <unk> before reaching an interchange with the northern terminus of DE 202 at the northern edge of Wilmington , at which point US 202 splits from I @-@ 95 . 
 I @-@ 95 in Delaware has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 169 @,@ 865 vehicles at the DE 1 / DE 7 interchange in Christiana to a low of 48 @,@ <unk> vehicles at the DE 92 interchange in <unk> . As part of the Interstate Highway System , the entire length of I @-@ 95 in Delaware is a part of the National Highway System . 
 I @-@ 95 has a toll plaza along the Delaware Turnpike near the Maryland border in Newark that charges $ 4 @.@ 00 for cars . Cash or E @-@ <unk> is accepted for payment of tolls . 
 When the highway first opened in 1963 , the toll at the state line was 30 cents . Prior to 1976 , ramp tolls were collected at the DE <unk> , DE 273 , and DE 7 interchanges . The ramp tolls required exact change , and many motorists were caught by police <unk> the tolls because they did not have the proper change . In 1970 , an attempt was made to use the honor system for motorists without the proper change at the <unk> to pay the tolls by mailing them . However , it was discontinued after a month because most motorists did not mail in their tolls . In 1976 , Governor Sherman W. <unk> signed House Bill <unk> , which was sponsored by Representative Gerard A. Cain . This bill called for the elimination of the three ramp tolls while keeping the mainline toll plaza near the Maryland border . The ramp tolls stopped being collected on October 1 , 1976 . 
 In 1981 , plans were announced to <unk> the former toll <unk> at the DE 273 and DE 7 interchanges ; however , the DE <unk> interchange toll <unk> were to remain to collect tolls from trucks . The mainline toll plaza was planned to be closed on July 1 , 1981 after the bonds to construct the road were paid off , but was kept by " Operation <unk> " , a $ 93 million project by Governor Pierre S. du <unk> IV that would use the tolls collected at the toll plaza to fund improvements to the turnpike along with other roads in the state of Delaware . In the summer of 2011 , reconstruction of the Delaware Turnpike toll plaza was completed in a $ 32 @.@ 6 million project , adding high @-@ speed E @-@ <unk> lanes . As of 2011 , the Delaware Turnpike was the third most expensive toll road in the United States based on a cost @-@ per @-@ mile average , at a rate of 23 cents per mile ( 14 <unk> / km ) . 
 The Delaware Welcome Center service plaza is located in the median of I @-@ 95 between the DE <unk> and DE 273 interchanges east of Newark . The service plaza offers a <unk> gas station , a convenience store , multiple fast @-@ food restaurants , a Delaware <unk> Center offering tourist information , and retail options including a store called <unk> from Delaware that sells Delaware @-@ related merchandise . The Delaware Welcome Center is run by <unk> . 
 When the Delaware Turnpike opened in 1963 , a Hot <unk> restaurant and an <unk> service station was located along the road in the median . In 1964 , a proposal was made to build a truck stop and <unk> next to the existing facilities . The truck stop proposal was off and on for several years until a truck stop was built just over the border in Maryland in 1975 . In 1983 , Hot <unk> was replaced by Roy Rogers and Bob 's Big Boy in order to offer both sit @-@ down dining and fast food . This was the largest Roy Rogers and Bob 's Big Boy location at the time and restaurant namesake Roy Rogers and Lieutenant Governor Michael Castle were in attendance for the opening . In September 2009 , the Delaware Welcome Center was closed for a reconstruction project that would construct a new service plaza building , new gas pumps , new truck parking , and an improved visitor center . The renovated service plaza opened in June 2010 at a cost of $ 35 million . 
 In 1948 , the Wilmington Transportation Study proposed two new roads running between the southern end of Wilmington and the Pennsylvania border to improve traffic flow in the Wilmington area . Route A followed the current alignment of I @-@ 95 while Route B bypassed the city to the east along the current alignment of I @-@ 495 . Plans for building Route A were made in 1950 but were deferred a year later due to opposition . 
 Following the completion of the Delaware Memorial Bridge and the connecting New Jersey Turnpike in 1951 , through traffic coming from the bridge led to significant congestion on US 13 and US 40 . As a result of this , suggestions were made in 1954 for a limited @-@ access road to be constructed leading to the bridge that would alleviate congestion on US 40 . In 1956 , the Interstate Highway System was created , with two routes proposed along the current alignment of I @-@ 95 . FAI @-@ 1 was proposed to run from the Maryland state line east to an interchange west of <unk> while FAI @-@ 2 was proposed between this interchange and the Pennsylvania border through the western part of Wilmington . The corridor following FAI @-@ 1 and FAI @-@ 2 would become designated as part of I @-@ 95 , an Interstate Highway running along the East Coast of the United States . FAI @-@ 1 was originally planned as a free Interstate Highway using federal funds ; however , the road would not have been completed until 1967 under this plan . As a result , the state of Delaware financed the road with bond issues and would build it as a toll road called the Delaware Turnpike . 
 The first construction contracts for the Delaware Turnpike were awarded in 1957 , with construction soon following that year . Construction began on building a new bridge over US 13 / US 40 at the <unk> interchange in 1958 that would connect the Delaware Turnpike to the I @-@ 295 / US 40 approach to the Delaware Memorial Bridge . The same year , plans were made for several bridges along I @-@ 95 . In 1959 , work began on rebuilding the <unk> interchange to Interstate Highway standards . The same year , recommendations were made for the design and right @-@ of @-@ way acquisition along the planned route of I @-@ 95 as well as the construction of several contracts between the Maryland border and <unk> along the Delaware Turnpike , including the interchange with DE 41 / DE 141 and between I @-@ 95 , I @-@ 295 , and I @-@ 495 near the Christina River . The proposed routing for I @-@ 95 through Wilmington would take it through the central core between Adams and Jackson streets . <unk> tried to fight routing I @-@ 95 through the central core and instead suggested routing it along Bancroft Parkway to the west or the present @-@ day route of I @-@ 495 to the east . However , the lame @-@ duck Republican @-@ controlled city council approved routing I @-@ 95 along Adams and Jackson streets in 1957 . The demolition of homes began in January 1959 . 
 A year later , construction began on overpasses and ramps at the <unk> interchange . The same year , suggestions were made to build I @-@ 95 across the Christina Marsh as well as construct the bridges over the Christina River and the Pennsylvania Railroad in Wilmington . A contract was awarded for the Christina River interchange in 1961 . By 1961 , all construction contracts along the Delaware Turnpike had been completed except for the DE 41 / DE 141 interchange and the Christina River interchange . In 1962 , the I @-@ 95 bridges over the Christina River , the Pennsylvania Railroad , and Little Mill Creek were finished while plans were made for the South Wilmington Viaduct that would cross over several railroad tracks belonging to the Pennsylvania Railroad , Baltimore and Ohio Railroad , and the Reading Railroad . The same year , the roadway was built between the Christina River interchange and the South Wilmington Viaduct . The new northbound lanes of DE 41 / DE 141 through the I @-@ 95 interchange opened in November 1962 . The southbound lanes of DE 41 / DE 141 opened in June 1964 , enabling directional flow of DE 41 / DE 141 through the interchange . In September 1963 , construction work on the turnpike was halted by <unk> workers . 
 The remainder of I @-@ 95 between the Christina River interchange and the Pennsylvania border would be built as a non @-@ <unk> freeway . In April 1964 , construction contracts were awarded for bridges at the Christina River interchange that would carry I @-@ 95 and I @-@ 495 traffic over I @-@ 295 . In late spring of 1964 , construction on the South Wilmington Viaduct began . In June of that year , the <unk> of the I @-@ 95 bridge over the Brandywine Creek was completed . In August 1964 , construction began on the I @-@ 95 interchange with <unk> Road and the northern terminus of I @-@ 495 in <unk> . In 1965 , construction was underway to build the below @-@ surface alignment of I @-@ 95 between Fourth Street and the Brandywine Creek in Wilmington . The construction of I @-@ 95 through Wilmington led to demolition of 360 to 370 homes in the West Side neighborhood between Adams and Jackson streets . The construction of the highway led to the decline of the residential and commercial base in Wilmington . Work was also underway on the portion of I @-@ 95 northeast of Wilmington , which would parallel the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad . In 1966 , I @-@ 95 was completed and opened to traffic between the Christina River interchange with I @-@ 295 and I @-@ 495 and downtown Wilmington , where ramps connected the highway to Maryland Avenue and Lancaster Avenue . The completion of this section of I @-@ 95 provided an uninterrupted freeway connection between Wilmington and Baltimore . The ramps to downtown Wilmington were added as a compromise of building the freeway through the city and would bring economic development to the Wilmington <unk> . In August 1968 , I @-@ 95 between the South Wilmington Viaduct and US 202 was completed and opened to traffic . On November 1 , 1968 , the freeway was opened between US 202 and the Pennsylvania border . With this , the entire length of I @-@ 95 in Delaware was constructed , making Delaware the third state to complete its section of I @-@ 95 . 
 In November 1968 , work began to widen the Delaware Turnpike from four to six lanes to handle increasing traffic volumes . The widening project was completed in December 1969 , one year ahead of schedule . In 1969 , a plan was made to widen the turnpike between DE <unk> and DE 273 to ten lanes and between DE 273 and DE 141 to 12 lanes in a 3 @-@ 3 @-@ 3 @-@ 3 local @-@ express lane configuration . This was later scaled down to a proposal to widen the road to eight lanes total . The widening of the Delaware Turnpike to eight lanes occurred in the 1980s . From 1971 to 1978 , a north @-@ south extension of the Delaware Turnpike running south to Dover was studied . This extension of the turnpike evolved into a " Relief Route " for US 13 and was built as DE 1 between 1987 and 2003 . 
 On June 28 , 1978 , the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials ( <unk> ) approved <unk> I @-@ 95 along the I @-@ 495 alignment . However , <unk> disapproved renumbering the alignment of I @-@ 95 through Wilmington as I @-@ 595 . On October 27 of that year , <unk> gave conditional approval for I @-@ 95 through Wilmington to be designated as I @-@ 195 from I @-@ 95 near Newport north to US 202 while the route from US 202 to I @-@ 95 in <unk> would become I @-@ 395 . I @-@ 895 was designated along the <unk> approved route of I @-@ 195 and I @-@ 395 on June 25 , 1979 . In 1980 , the South Wilmington Viaduct was reconstructed . On November 14 , 1980 , I @-@ 95 and I @-@ 495 were returned to their original <unk> , with I @-@ 895 decommissioned . US 202 was designated concurrent with I @-@ 95 through Wilmington in 1984 . 
 In 2000 , I @-@ 95 was completely rebuilt between US 202 and the Pennsylvania border . The reconstruction completely tore apart the concrete pavement and replaced it with asphalt and also improved drainage and rebuilt bridges . In April 2000 , the southbound lanes were closed , with the lanes between DE 3 and US 202 reopening in May and the remainder reopening in mid @-@ summer . In July , the northbound lanes were closed , with the lanes reopening between US 202 and DE 3 in September and the remainder reopening in October . During the closure , through traffic was <unk> to I @-@ 495 . 
 In 2003 , work began on rebuilding the bridge carrying DE 58 over the highway to allow for future improvements to I @-@ 95 , with completion in fall 2006 , a year behind schedule . In May 2007 , construction began to widen I @-@ 95 between the DE 1 / DE 7 and DE 141 interchanges from eight to ten lanes due to rising traffic levels and increased development . The widening project was completed in November 2008 . Traffic congestion at the cloverleaf interchange with DE 1 / DE 7 in Christiana led to <unk> to improve the interchange . The project included adding flyover connecting ramps from northbound DE 1 to northbound I @-@ 95 and from southbound I @-@ 95 to southbound DE 1 which allowed for easier merging patterns and the elimination of lengthy <unk> on the former ramp design . Construction of a new " ring access road " around Christiana Mall began in February 2011 and was completed in March 2012 , with a newly built bridge over DE 1 , just south of the I @-@ 95 interchange . The ramp from southbound I @-@ 95 to southbound DE 1 / DE 7 opened on August 27 , 2013 and the ramp from northbound DE 1 / DE 7 to northbound I @-@ 95 opened on October 17 , 2013 , with a ribbon cutting ceremony attended by Governor Jack <unk> and <unk> secretary <unk> <unk> . 
 In December 2011 , a project began to improve the interchange between I @-@ 95 and US 202 / DE 202 in order to reduce congestion . The project widened the ramp between northbound I @-@ 95 and northbound US 202 to two lanes , the ramp between southbound US 202 and southbound I @-@ 95 was extended to modern standards , and the ramp between southbound I @-@ 95 and southbound DE 202 was relocated from a cloverleaf loop to a directional ramp that intersects DE 202 at a <unk> intersection . In addition , the interchange ramps were <unk> and bridges were rehabilitated . The project was finished in July 2015 , months behind schedule due to the closure of I @-@ 495 in 2014 . On August 7 , 2015 , a dedication ceremony to mark the completion of the project was held , with Governor <unk> , Senator Tom <unk> , and <unk> secretary Jennifer <unk> in attendance . The project , which cost over $ 33 million , was 80 @-@ percent funded by the federal government . 
 On June 2 , 2014 , the I @-@ 495 bridge over the Christina River was closed after it was discovered that four support columns were tilting . During this closure , traffic from I @-@ 495 was <unk> onto I @-@ 95 , and several major roads in the Wilmington area experienced increased traffic congestion . The southbound lanes of I @-@ 495 reopened on July 31 , a month earlier than expected , and the northbound lanes of I @-@ 495 reopened on August 23 . 
 I @-@ 95 has two auxiliary routes that are located within the state of Delaware . I @-@ 295 runs from I @-@ 95 near Newport east to the Delaware Memorial Bridge , where it crosses the Delaware River into New Jersey . Once in New Jersey , I @-@ 295 intersects the southern terminus of the New Jersey Turnpike and continues northeast a bypass route of Philadelphia . I @-@ 295 reaches its northern terminus at I @-@ 95 near <unk> , New Jersey . I @-@ 495 is a bypass of Wilmington to the east . I @-@ 495 runs from I @-@ 95 south of Wilmington near Newport , passing through the Port of Wilmington and running along the Delaware River , before merging back in with I @-@ 95 at the Pennsylvania state border in <unk> . 
 <unk> ( 2005 ) was a professional wrestling pay @-@ per @-@ view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) and presented by <unk> 's <unk> , which took place on June 26 , 2005 , at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas , Nevada . It was the fifth annual <unk> event . Professional wrestling is a type of sports entertainment in which theatrical events are combined with a competitive sport . The buildup to the matches and the scenarios that took place before , during , and after the event were planned by WWE 's script writers . The event starred wrestlers from the Raw brand : storyline expansions of the promotion where employees are assigned to wrestling brands under the WWE banner . 
 The main event was a Hell in a Cell match for the World Heavyweight Championship between <unk> and Triple H , which <unk> won by pinfall after executing a <unk> <unk> . One of the predominant matches on the card was John <unk> versus Chris Jericho versus Christian in a Triple <unk> match for the WWE Championship . <unk> won the match and retained the title after <unk> Christian . Another primary match on the <unk> was Kurt Angle versus Shawn Michaels in a rematch of their bout at WrestleMania 21 . Michaels won the match by pinfall after executing Sweet <unk> Music . 
 Many of the existing <unk> were settled following the event . Notably , <unk> was drafted to the SmackDown ! brand , thus ending his feud with Triple H. The feud between Kane and Edge also concluded after the event , as Edge entered an angle with Matt Hardy . The feud between <unk> and Jericho , however , continued and led to a match at SummerSlam , which <unk> won . 
 The event featured six professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre @-@ existing scripted <unk> , plots and storylines . <unk> portrayed either a villainous or fan favorite gimmick as they followed a series of events which generally built tension , leading to a wrestling match . The name of a wrestler 's character was not always the person 's birth name , as wrestlers often use a stage name to portray their character . All wrestlers were from the Raw brand – a storyline division in which WWE assigned its employees to a different program , the other being SmackDown ! . 
 One of the main matches on the <unk> was between Kurt Angle and Shawn Michaels . At the start of the year , Angle and Michaels both participated in the Royal Rumble match at the 2005 Royal Rumble pay @-@ per @-@ view event . During the match , Michaels eliminated Angle . In retaliation , Angle returned to the match and eliminated Michaels and then attacked him outside the ring . The two engaged in a feud , which led to an <unk> match at WrestleMania 21 , as Angle was part of the SmackDown ! roster and Michaels belonged to the Raw roster . At WrestleMania 21 , Angle got the win over Michaels by forcing him to submit to the <unk> Lock . On the June 13 episode of Raw , Angle was revealed to be the second draft pick for the Raw brand . That same evening , Michaels challenged Angle to a rematch at <unk> , which Angle accepted . 
 Before the event went live on pay @-@ per @-@ view , Rosey and The Hurricane ( with Super Stacy ) defeated The Heart <unk> ( Antonio and Romeo ) in a match taped for Sunday Night Heat . The first match that aired was between <unk> and Shelton Benjamin for the Intercontinental Championship . After back and forth action , <unk> removed the padding from one of the <unk> . Benjamin then hit his head on the exposed metal while performing a <unk> splash . <unk> pinned Benjamin with a roll @-@ up , allowing <unk> to retain the Intercontinental Championship . 
 Next was a match between Victoria and Christy <unk> . The match saw Victoria lift <unk> in the air and drop her down with force . Control of the match went back and forth , but the bout came to an end when Victoria countered <unk> 's sunset flip . Victoria got the pinfall by using the ring ropes for leverage . 
 The third match of the night saw Kane in a match with Edge , during which both men took the upper hand . <unk> <unk> in the match , hitting Kane with a big boot . <unk> later , <unk> was quickly taken out by Edge after he hit him with his Money in the Bank <unk> . Following the events in the match , Kane performed a <unk> and pinned Edge . 
 The final match of the event was a Hell in a Cell bout between <unk> and Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship . During the match , Triple H choked <unk> with a chain and hit him in the back with a steel chair wrapped with barbed wire . <unk> regained the momentum by grabbing Triple H 's <unk> and hitting him in the mouth . <unk> retained the World title after he performed a <unk> on Triple H onto the steel steps , which was followed with a <unk> <unk> and a cover for the win . After the Hell in a Cell match , Triple H stood to his feet and was given a standing ovation by the audience . 
 Immediately after their Hell in a Cell match as an exclusive to WWE Home Video , Triple H ( with Ric Flair ) and <unk> encountered backstage to put their differences aside and embraced with Triple H <unk> " This is Evolution , baby " , referring to their past as a stable , which had disbanded until 2014 . 
 Following <unk> , Eric <unk> vowed to make John <unk> 's stint on Raw difficult , he " hand picked " Chris Jericho to take the WWE title off <unk> by booking a match between <unk> and Jericho at SummerSlam . During their feud , even though <unk> was portrayed as the face and Jericho as the heel , a vocal section of live crowds nonetheless chose to <unk> <unk> during their matches , including at SummerSlam where <unk> retained the title after executing an <unk> . 
 After a successful tag team win at <unk> , in which Shawn Michaels and <unk> Hogan defeated Muhammad Hassan and <unk> . Michaels and Hogan were placed in tag team match against Kurt Angle and <unk> on an episode of Raw . The match saw Hogan and Michaels get the victory . During the post @-@ match pose , Michaels <unk> Hogan , which knocked Hogan to the ground and turning Michaels heel for the first time since returning to the company in 2002 . The following week , Michaels challenged Hogan to a match at SummerSlam , which Hogan accepted . In this match , Hogan maintained his perfect record at SummerSlam by defeating Michaels . 
 The feud between Edge and Kane came to an end when Edge was put in an angle with Matt Hardy . On the July 11 episode of Raw , Hardy , who at the time was unemployed by WWE , made a surprise appearance , interfering in a match between Edge and Kane . The following week , as both Edge and <unk> were walking towards the ring before a scheduled Steel cage match against Kane , Hardy attacked Edge from behind . On the August 1 episode of Raw , Vince McMahon officially announced Hardy 's return to WWE , adding that Hardy would face Edge at SummerSlam . The following week , Hardy made his in @-@ ring return , defeating <unk> . After the victory , Hardy was attacked by Edge , and was carried backstage . In retaliation , Hardy <unk> Edge in the locker room . At SummerSlam , Edge was given the win in the match after Hardy hit the ring post and began to bleed <unk> , which caused the referee to stop the match . 
 After a four @-@ month hiatus , Triple H returned on the WWE Homecoming episode of Raw on October 3 . He took part in a match , teaming up with Ric Flair , who was wrestling as a face , to take on Chris Masters and <unk> . The duo defeated Masters and <unk> ; after the match , Triple H turned on Flair and hit him with a <unk> . This led to an angle between Triple H and Flair . At <unk> Tuesday , Triple H and Flair met in a Steel cage match , a <unk> chosen by the fans , for the Intercontinental Championship . The match saw Flair retain the Intercontinental Championship , after escaping through the cage door . 
 Elizabeth <unk> ( 20 March 1890 – 27 July 1981 ) was a Hungarian nuclear chemist , known for her work with radioactive isotopes . After developing an enhanced method of preparing <unk> samples , she was internationally recognized as the leading expert in isotope separation and <unk> preparation . Between 1914 and 1918 , during her <unk> study with George de <unk> , she developed a theory that the velocity of <unk> depended on the mass of the <unk> . As only a few atomic elements had been identified , her confirmation of the existence of <unk> @-@ Y was a major contribution to nuclear chemistry . She was awarded the <unk> Prize by the Austrian Academy of Sciences in 1933 . 
 After <unk> to the United States in 1941 , she was granted a Carnegie Fellowship to continue her research and provided technical information on her <unk> extraction methods to the Manhattan Project . Later in her career , she became a nuclear chemistry professor at the Oak Ridge Institute of Nuclear Studies and after 15 years there transferred to the Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of Miami . At both Oak Ridge and Miami , she continued her work on the <unk> of <unk> elements and <unk> dating . She was posthumously inducted into the Tennessee Women 's Hall of Fame in 2015 . 
 Elizabeth <unk> was born on 20 March 1890 in Budapest , Hungary , to Ida , ( née Mahler ) and Samuel <unk> . Her father was a prosperous Jewish physician who worked with Louis <unk> and Henri @-@ August <unk> , founders of <unk> therapy , to introduce the techniques to Budapest , and installed one of the first x @-@ ray machines there . Elizabeth wanted to become a physician like her father , but Samuel believed that it would be too difficult for a woman to attain . Though he died when she was in her second year of university , <unk> 's father had encouraged her and spurred her interest in science from a young age . She enrolled in the Philosophy Faculty at the University of Budapest , studying chemistry , <unk> , and physics , receiving her PhD in 1912 . 
 When <unk> left Budapest , in 1918 Franz <unk> , a noted <unk> and <unk> of the University of Budapest , offered <unk> a teaching position . She taught chemistry to selected students whom <unk> felt had insufficient knowledge to complete the course work , becoming the first woman to teach chemistry at university level in Hungary . 
 Faced with encroaching Russians on one side and the Nazi involvement in Hungary during World War II on the other , in early 1941 <unk> obtained a visitor 's <unk> and fled to the United States . For three months she was unemployed and suspected of being a spy , though she sought help from scientists she had worked with in Europe to find employment . At a meeting of the American Physical Society , she met Austrian physicist Karl <unk> , who helped her secure a teaching post at Trinity College in Washington , D.C. During this period , she was awarded a Carnegie Fellowship to research at the <unk> Laboratory of the Carnegie Institute , working on analysis of seawater and sediments . Between 1941 and 1942 , she conducted work at Carnegie in conjunction with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution , measuring the amount of <unk> in seawater and river water . Her study , completed in 1942 , showed that the ratio of <unk> to uranium was lower in seawater and higher in river water . 
 <unk> continued teaching until 1946 at Trinity . In 1947 , she began working at the <unk> National Laboratory . Her work there focused on ion exchange reactions and she published several works for the United States Atomic Energy Commission . In 1948 , she became a naturalized U.S. citizen . In 1950 , she began research work at the Oak Ridge Institute of Nuclear Studies as a chemist and senior scientist in nuclear studies . During this period , she collaborated with Texas A & M University on the <unk> of <unk> sediments , dating core samples by estimating their radioactive decay . She retired from Oak Ridge in 1965 and then went to work at the University of Miami , teaching at the Institute of Marine Sciences where she worked for a decade . <unk> retired for a second time in 1976 and returned to Tennessee in the late 1970s , publishing a book in 1978 on her radioactive <unk> methods . 
 <unk> died on 27 July 1981 in Oak Ridge , Tennessee . She was posthumously inducted into the Tennessee Women 's Hall of Fame in 2015 .

 Interstate 94 ( I @-@ 94 ) is a part of the Interstate Highway System that runs from <unk> , Montana , to the Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan . In Michigan , it is a state trunkline highway that enters the state south of New Buffalo and runs eastward through several metropolitan areas in the southern section of the state . The highway serves Benton Harbor , Kalamazoo , Battle Creek on the west side of the peninsula . From there it also runs through Jackson and Ann Arbor , and portions of Metro Detroit , before angling northeasterly to Port Huron , where it terminates on the Blue Water Bridge at the Canadian border . 
 The first segment of what later became I @-@ 94 within the state , the <unk> Run Expressway , was built near <unk> and Belleville in 1941 , with an easterly extension to Detroit in 1945 . This expressway was initially numbered M @-@ 112 . By 1960 , the length of I @-@ 94 was completed from Detroit to New Buffalo . Subsequent extensions in the 1960s completed most of the rest of the route . The last segment opened to the public in 1972 when Indiana completed their connection across the state line . The routing of I @-@ 94 is notable for containing the first full freeway @-@ to @-@ freeway interchange in the United States , connecting to the Lodge Freeway ( M @-@ 10 ) , and for comprising the first complete border @-@ to @-@ border toll @-@ free freeway in a state in the United States . The highway has one auxiliary route , Interstate 194 , which serves downtown Battle Creek , and eight business routes . 
 The entire length of I @-@ 94 is listed on the National Highway System , a network of roadways important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility . The freeway carries 154 @,@ 800 vehicles on average between I @-@ 75 and <unk> Street in Detroit and 15 @,@ 370 vehicles immediately east of the Blue Water Bridge in Port Huron ; the highest and lowest traffic counts in 2013 , respectively . As the state trunkline highway closest to the lake shore in these areas , I @-@ 94 carries the Lake Michigan Circle Tour south of Benton Harbor – St. Joseph and the Lake Huron Circle Tour in the Port Huron area . Sections through the Detroit area are named the Detroit Industrial and <unk> Ford freeways . I @-@ 94 in the state is either a <unk> or six @-@ lane freeway for most of its length ; one segment in the Detroit area has up to ten lanes total near the airport . 
 I @-@ 94 crosses into Michigan south of New Buffalo and parallels the Lake Michigan shoreline about three miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) inland . The freeway runs northeasterly through rural <unk> farmland in the southwestern corner of the Lower Peninsula . I @-@ 94 traverses an area just east of the Warren <unk> State Park as the freeway runs parallel to the Red Arrow Highway . I @-@ 94 crosses its companion highway south of St. Joseph ; Red Arrow turns northward carrying the business loop for Benton Harbor and St. Joseph . The freeway curves further inland to cross the St. Joseph River near <unk> Park . East of Benton Harbor , I @-@ 94 meets the Napier Avenue where US 31 <unk> onto the freeway . East of the Southwest Michigan Regional Airport , I @-@ 94 / US 31 meets the southern end of I @-@ 196 ; US 31 departs the I @-@ 94 freeway to follow I @-@ 196 , and I @-@ 94 continues its course away from Lake Michigan . 
 South of <unk> , I @-@ 94 turns eastward and roughly follows the <unk> Paw River on a course that takes it south of <unk> and Hartford . Between the latter two cities , the freeway crosses from northeastern <unk> County into western Van <unk> County . It curves around and between Lake <unk> and <unk> Lake near the junction with the northern end of M @-@ 51 . About four miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) further east , I @-@ 94 crosses M @-@ 40 south of <unk> Paw . Continuing eastward , I @-@ 94 runs south of <unk> before crossing into western Kalamazoo County . 
 In Texas Township , the freeway enters the western edges of the Kalamazoo suburbs . South of the campus for Western Michigan University 's College of Engineering & Applied Sciences in Portage , I @-@ 94 intersects US 131 . That freeway also carries Kalamazoo 's business loop northward . Near the Kalamazoo / Battle Creek International Airport , I @-@ 94 crosses into the southeastern corner of Kalamazoo before entering <unk> Township . The freeway intersects the eastern end of the business loop at a partial interchange near Morrow Lake in the township . I @-@ 94 continues eastward out of the eastern Kalamazoo suburbs . It parallels the Kalamazoo River through the <unk> area . Before crossing into <unk> County on the east side of Battle Creek , I @-@ 94 has the only <unk> on any of Michigan 's Interstate Highways for a gate providing access for military vehicles into the Fort <unk> Training Center . 
 I @-@ 94 crosses into <unk> County southwest of the W. K. <unk> Airport and enters the city of Battle Creek . Immediately east of the county line , the freeway has an interchange with the western end of Battle Creek 's business loop . Next to the <unk> Square Mall , I @-@ 94 meets its own auxiliary Interstate in Michigan : I @-@ 194 . I @-@ 94 turns to the northwest to round <unk> Lake , intersecting M @-@ <unk> before crossing the Kalamazoo River . East of the river crossing , the freeway meets an interchange for M @-@ 96 , M @-@ 311 and the eastern end of the Battle Creek business loop near the <unk> Casino in Emmett Township . Turning back eastward , I @-@ 94 exits the eastern Battle Creek suburbs and continues to an interchange with I @-@ 69 near Marshall ; the business loop for Marshall follows I @-@ 69 southward . 
 Continuing eastward I @-@ 94 traverses rural land on the north side of Marshall . The freeway runs north of , and parallel to , the Kalamazoo River through eastern <unk> County . It angles southeasterly toward Albion before returning to an easterly course on the north side of town . I @-@ 94 crosses into western Jackson County before intersecting M @-@ 99 . From there , it runs generally due east with a <unk> around <unk> on a course to Jackson . West of the Jackson County Airport , the Jackson business loop follows M @-@ 60 southward and I @-@ 94 travels through the north side of Jackson . North of downtown , US 127 <unk> in from the north and runs concurrently with I @-@ 94 around the city . Southeast of the Michigan State Prison , US 127 departs to the south , and I @-@ 94 continues eastward through eastern Jackson County . 
 The freeway runs north of a racetrack complex in Chelsea next to the M @-@ 52 interchange . As I @-@ 94 continues easterly , it passes into the western edge of the Ann Arbor area . West of downtown , the M @-@ 14 freeway splits off to the northeast , and I @-@ 94 turns to the south and southeast to curve around the south side of the city . The freeway passes between the <unk> Mall and the Ann Arbor Municipal Airport . On the southeastern corner of Ann Arbor , I @-@ 94 intersects US 23 and continues around the south side of <unk> . South of that city , the freeway also carries US 12 and crosses the Huron River north of its entry into Ford Lake . I @-@ 94 <unk> southeasterly around the south side of the <unk> Run Airport complex and crosses into Wayne County . 
 South of <unk> Run , I @-@ 94 parallels Belleville Lake . East of the lake , it intersects I @-@ 275 near the northwest corner of Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport and angles northeasterly through the southwestern Detroit suburbs along the Detroit Industrial Freeway . I @-@ 94 used the Gateway Bridge over the single @-@ point interchange at US 24 ( Telegraph Road ) in Taylor ; these bridges were inspired by Super Bowl <unk> and provide a western gateway to the city . Further east , the freeway intersects M @-@ 39 ( <unk> Freeway ) and passes the <unk> Giant <unk> in Allen Park . I @-@ 94 then turns to the northeast through the Ford River Rouge Complex in <unk> before turning back easterly on the <unk> Ford Freeway into Detroit . 
 I @-@ 94 crosses Detroit in an east – west direction well inland of , and parallel to , the Detroit River . The freeway intersects I @-@ 96 ( Jeffries Freeway ) and M @-@ 10 ( Lodge Freeway ) on the West Side , passing the main campus of Wayne State University before crossing onto the East Side at M @-@ 1 ( Woodward Avenue ) . Immediately east of the interchange with I @-@ 75 ( Chrysler Freeway ) , I @-@ 94 forms the southern border of the Milwaukee Junction district . The <unk> Ford Freeway continues through residential neighborhoods of Detroit 's East Side . I @-@ 94 turns more northerly , <unk> the shoreline of Lake St. Clair , and exits Detroit for Harper Woods . Just north of the interchange for M @-@ 102 ( <unk> Road ) , the freeway crosses 8 Mile Road and enters <unk> County . 
 Running northward through <unk> County , I @-@ 94 meets the eastern end of I @-@ 696 ( <unk> Freeway ) about three miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) north of the county line in St. Clair <unk> . The freeway continues to parallel the <unk> , and travels to the west of <unk> Air National Guard Base in Harrison Township . I @-@ 94 turns back to the northwest at 23 Mile Road at the interchange with M @-@ 3 and M @-@ 29 . North of 26 Mile Road , the freeway exits the northern suburbs and crosses into farmland in The <unk> region . 
 South of Michigan Meadows Golf Course , I @-@ 94 crosses County Line Road and enters St. Clair County . The freeway continues northeasterly as far as <unk> before turning northward near the St. Clair County International Airport . From there , it runs roughly parallel to the St. Clair River . I @-@ 94 runs along the western edge of residential areas for <unk> and Port Huron as it continues northward . Immediately west of downtown Port Huron , I @-@ 94 intersects with I @-@ 69 ; the two freeways merge and turn first east and then north through an interchange that also features connections to BL I @-@ 69 . 
 I @-@ 94 / I @-@ 69 turns back to the east about a mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) north of their confluence to cross the Black River north of downtown . On the eastern bank of the river , there is one final interchange for M @-@ 25 and BL I @-@ 69 / BL I @-@ 94 before the freeway reaches the toll and customs <unk> for the twin @-@ span Blue Water Bridge . Past these <unk> , I @-@ 94 / I @-@ 69 <unk> the approach to the bridge which cross the St. Clair River to Point Edward ( Sarnia ) , Ontario . At the international boundary at the center of the river , the I @-@ 94 designation jointly terminates with I @-@ 69 . 
 The first major overland transportation corridors in the future state of Michigan were the Indian trails . One of these , the St. Joseph Trail , followed the path of the modern I @-@ 94 . The State <unk> Highway System was created on May 13 , 1913 , by an act of the Michigan Legislature ; at the time , Division 6 corresponded to the rough path of today 's I @-@ 94 . In 1919 , the Michigan State Highway Department ( MSHD ) <unk> the highway system for the first time , and three different highways followed sections of the modern I @-@ 69 corridor . The original M @-@ 11 ran from the Indiana state line north to <unk> where M @-@ 17 connected easterly to Detroit . The third highway was M @-@ 19 from Detroit northeast to Port Huron . 
 On November 11 , 1926 , the United States <unk> Highway System was approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials ( <unk> ) , and the original route of US 12 replaced the highways from the state line northeasterly to Detroit ; US 31 overlapped the highway between St. Joseph and <unk> . The remainder of the future I @-@ 94 corridor was served by US 25 between Detroit and Port Huron . The first span of the Blue Water Bridge opened between Port Huron and Point Edward , Ontario , in 1938 . 
 The first segments of upgraded highways along the future route of I @-@ 94 were added during World War II . Construction on the <unk> Run Expressway started in 1941 before the US entered the war . It was opened on September 12 , 1942 , to provide improved access to Ford 's <unk> Run bomber plants . The highway was given the M @-@ 112 designation at the time . The expressway was extended eastward as the Detroit Industrial Expressway into Detroit ; the first section opened in 1943 and the remainder was completed in March 1945 . Land acquisition for the <unk> Ford Freeway started in 1945 . Originally referred to as the <unk> Freeway , the freeway became known as the <unk> Ford Freeway following an April 1946 petition . The interchange between the Lodge Freeway and the <unk> Ford Freeway was built in 1953 as the first full freeway @-@ to @-@ freeway interchange in the United States . In mid @-@ 1956 , the M @-@ 112 designation was decommissioned and replaced by a rerouted US 12 . During the mid @-@ 1950s , the Detroit Streets and <unk> campaign proposed a high @-@ speed rail line in the median of the <unk> Run , Detroit Industrial and <unk> Ford freeways ; instead of building the rail line , special boarding stations adjacent to dedicated bus lanes in the interchanges along the highway were used . 
 In other parts of the state , other segments of highway were built to bypass the cities along the future I @-@ 94 corridor . In 1940 , a southern bypass of Battle Creek opened along Columbia Avenue , and the former routing through downtown on Michigan Avenue became a Business US 12 ( Bus . US 12 ) . In late 1951 or early 1952 , a northerly bypass of Jackson opened , and the former route through downtown on Michigan Avenue became another Bus . US 12 . By the next year , the western half of the Jackson bypass opened , including a bypass of <unk> . In 1954 , a new bypass of Kalamazoo and <unk> opened ; US 12 was rerouted to follow the new highway while M @-@ 96 replaced part of the old route and US <unk> in the area . 
 The first planning maps from 1947 for what later became the Interstate Highway System included a highway along I @-@ 94 's route in Michigan . This highway was included on the 1955 plan for the " National System of Interstate and Defense Highways " with a proposed spur in the Battle Creek area . The modern I @-@ 94 was numbered I @-@ 92 between Benton Harbor – St. Joseph and Detroit with I @-@ 77 from Detroit to Port Huron in the August 1957 plans . 
 In April 1958 , the MSHD wanted to provide a single number for a more direct routing of a Detroit @-@ to – Chicago freeway ; the state proposed <unk> I @-@ 94 to replace I @-@ 92 in the state , but retained the I @-@ 77 designation . On June 27 , 1958 , <unk> adopted their original numbering plan for Michigan , minus the state 's proposed changes . Around the same time , a section of M @-@ 146 near Port Huron was converted into an approach freeway for the Blue Water Bridge . 
 Sections of freeway opened in southwestern Michigan in 1960 between the Benton Harbor – St Joseph area and between Jackson and Ann Arbor ; the latter was built over existing portions of US 12 . In this year Michigan became the first state to complete a border @-@ to @-@ border toll @-@ free Interstate within their state , running for 205 miles ( 330 km ) from Detroit toward New Buffalo , the longest toll @-@ free freeway in the country at the time . 
 In January 1962 , the US 12 designation was removed from the I @-@ 94 freeway . In the process , the designation was transferred to replace the US 112 designation in its entirety . After this transfer , I @-@ 94 was no longer concurrent with US 12 , except for the <unk> bypass . In 1963 the freeway was extended south of New Buffalo to end at M @-@ 239 . Traffic was diverted down M @-@ 239 into Indiana where State Road 39 carried traffic the rest of the way to the Indiana <unk> Road . By the end of the year , a section of highway opened between Mount <unk> and <unk> , and US 25 was rerouted to run concurrently along the freeway from the New Baltimore area northward . 
 The eastern terminus of I @-@ 94 in the Port Huron area was dedicated on October 14 , 1964 , signaling the completion of the highway between <unk> and the Blue Water Bridge . Two years later , the gap between the Wayne – <unk> county line and the end of the freeway near Mount <unk> was filled in when another section of freeway opened . North of Albion , the route of the freeway previously crossed a branch of the New York Central Railroad at @-@ grade ; the crossing was eliminated when the tracks were removed in 1968 . 
 The sections originally designated as the <unk> Run Expressway were rebuilt from <unk> Road in Belleville to <unk> Road in <unk> starting in 1972 . As part of this reconstruction , the segment between Haggerty Road and <unk> Road was widened from four to six lanes , and the eastbound lanes were realigned to facilitate construction of an interchange with I @-@ 275 , a western bypass of Detroit which was under construction at the time . The <unk> Run segment was also resurfaced at this point , as the old road bed did not contain steel <unk> . Construction of this interchange also obliterated a partial interchange with Huron River Drive . 
 The final section of I @-@ 94 in Michigan opened to traffic on November 2 , 1972 , when the connection across the state line into Indiana was dedicated . This last segment in Michigan between M @-@ 239 and the state line opened when Indiana completed an 18 @-@ mile ( 29 km ) segment of freeway in their state . 
 On August 16 , 1987 , Northwest Airlines Flight 255 crashed after attempting to take off from Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport , killing all but one passenger , Cecilia <unk> , upon exploding at an overpass at <unk> Road . A decade later , in July 1997 , the second span of the Blue Water Bridge opened between Port Huron and Point Edward , Ontario . 
 The original interchange with US 24 ( Telegraph Road ) had only two bridges and left hand exits were used throughout . This interchange was <unk> in 2005 to a single @-@ point urban interchange ( <unk> ) design that was completed in December of that year . A pair of bridges called the Gateway <unk> Bridges ( alternately " Gateway to Detroit " ) was incorporated in the new interchange . 
 In 2011 , construction was started to widen I @-@ 94 / I @-@ 69 approaching the Blue Water Bridge allowing for dedicated lanes for local traffic and for Blue Water Bridge traffic . The lane configuration changes have confused drivers in the area , especially motorists with outdated <unk> devices ; because of this , MDOT installed updated signs complete with American and Canadian flags to help prevent drivers from heading to Canada by mistake . 
 Additional construction in the Port Huron area started in late 2013 to rebuild and <unk> the I @-@ 94 / I @-@ 69 interchange outside the city . The project improved 3 @.@ 7 miles ( 6 @.@ 0 km ) of freeway , replaced several bridges and ramps and cost $ 76 million . In June 2014 , MDOT closed the ramps from I @-@ 69 eastbound to BL I @-@ 69 through the interchange until later in the year . The project is slated to be completed in 2015 . 
 As the original expressway through the center of Detroit was being planned in the 1940s , it was unofficially named the Harper – <unk> Expressway after the streets along which it was to run . Some initial support surfaced to name it after Roy <unk> , the late president of the Hudson Motor Car Company and a former United States Secretary of Commerce under President Herbert Hoover . On April 23 , 1946 , the Detroit Common Council voted instead to name the highway after <unk> Ford , the son of Henry Ford and president of the Ford Motor Company from 1918 until his death in 1943 . 
 Two other original sections of I @-@ 94 's predecessor highways in the Detroit area were given early names . The westernmost of these is the <unk> Run Expressway , named for the <unk> Run complex . The plants at <unk> Run produced B @-@ 24 Liberator bombers by Ford Motor Company during World War II . The second , the Detroit Industrial Expressway , continued the route of the <unk> Run Expressway eastward into Detroit . Both highways were built to move workers from Detroit to the industrial plants at <unk> Run during the war and were later incorporated into I @-@ 94 in the 1950s as part of a Detroit – Chicago highway . 
 The section of I @-@ 94 northeast of Detroit was named after former Congressman James G. O <unk> by the Michigan Legislature . O <unk> was a World War II veteran who served in the United States House from 1959 until 1977 . During his tenure in Congress , he procured federal funds for the construction of I @-@ 94 through his district . The first attempt to name the highway after him failed in 1991 , but the honor was included in a budget bill passed in 1997 . The section of I @-@ 94 was dedicated on October 16 , 1998 , after donors privately raised nearly $ 10 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to $ 16 @,@ <unk> in 2015 ) to pay for the highway signs . 
 A segment of I @-@ 94 in Battle Creek between the exits for Business Loop I @-@ 94 ( BL I @-@ 94 ) and I @-@ 194 was named the 94th Combat Infantry Division Memorial Highway by the Michigan Legislature in 2002 . The name honors a unit of the US Army which was activated at the nearby Fort <unk> in 1942 and served with distinction in the European theatre of World War II . Because the unit originated in Battle Creek , and its number matched that of the freeway , the Legislature thought it only fitting to name the section of highway for the unit . The name was dedicated in ceremonies at a rest stop along the section of I @-@ 94 on September 28 , 2002 . 
 Another piece of I @-@ 94 in <unk> County was designated in 2004 as part of the Underground Railroad Memorial Highway . Starting in 1990 , the National Park Service started working to identify routes of the Underground Railroad . The Battle Creek area was active in the railroad during the Civil War , and the section of I @-@ 94 between exits 98 and 110 east of Battle Creek was included in the memorial designation . 
 In June 2012 , after a resolution passed by the Michigan Legislature was signed by <unk> Rick <unk> , a portion of I @-@ 94 in Taylor between <unk> and Pelham roads was named the " <unk> Lt. Dan <unk> Memorial Highway " after a 20 @-@ year veteran of the Taylor Police Department , who was killed in 2010 while helping motorists who had car trouble . 
 There are nine highways related to I @-@ 94 in Michigan . The first is the spur into downtown Battle Creek numbered I @-@ 194 and nicknamed " The <unk> " and officially called the " <unk> Truth Downtown Parkway " . This auxiliary Interstate Highway runs for about three miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) to connect I @-@ 94 northward into downtown . The other eight highways are business loops of I @-@ 94 that connect various cities ' <unk> with the main freeway . Unlike I @-@ 194 , these loops are not freeways . Located from west to east along I @-@ 94 's routing in Michigan , they serve Benton Harbor – St. Joseph , Kalamazoo , Battle Creek , Marshall , Albion , Jackson , Ann Arbor , and Port Huron . 
 SMS <unk> was a light cruiser of the <unk> class built by the German <unk> Marine ( Imperial Navy ) . She had one sister ship , SMS <unk> ; the ships were very similar to the previous <unk> @-@ class cruisers . The ship was laid down in 1911 , launched in November 1912 , and completed by January 1914 . Armed with twelve 10 @.@ 5 cm SK L / 45 guns , <unk> had a top speed of 28 @.@ 5 knots ( 52 @.@ 8 km / h ; 32 @.@ 8 mph ) , which allowed her to escape from British cruisers during her career . 
 After her commissioning , <unk> was assigned to overseas duties in the Caribbean . She arrived in the area in July 1914 , days before the outbreak of World War I. Once the war began , she armed the passenger liner SS Kronprinz Wilhelm , but while the ships were transferring equipment , British ships located them and pursued <unk> . Her superior speed allowed her to escape , after which she operated off the northeastern coast of Brazil . Here , she captured or sank sixteen ships . While en route to attack the shipping lanes to Barbados on 4 November 1914 , a spontaneous internal explosion destroyed the ship and killed the majority of the crew . The survivors used one of <unk> 's <unk> to return to Germany in December 1914 . 
 <unk> was ordered under the contract name " Ersatz <unk> " and was laid down at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel on 21 September 1911 . She was christened by Karl <unk> , the mayor of <unk> , and launched on 11 November 1912 , after which fitting @-@ out work commenced . She was commissioned into the High Seas Fleet on 15 January 1914 . The ship was 142 @.@ 2 meters ( 467 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 13 @.@ 7 m ( 45 ft ) and a draft of 5 @.@ 38 m ( 17 @.@ 7 ft ) forward . She displaced 6 @,@ 191 t ( 6 @,@ <unk> long tons ; 6 @,@ <unk> short tons ) at full combat load . Her propulsion system consisted of two sets of Marine steam turbines driving two 3 @.@ 5 @-@ meter ( 11 ft ) propellers . They were designed to give 26 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 19 @,@ 000 kW ) , but reached 37 @,@ <unk> shp ( 28 @,@ 251 kW ) in service . These were powered by twelve coal @-@ fired Marine @-@ type water @-@ tube boilers and two oil @-@ fired double @-@ ended boilers . These gave the ship a top speed of 28 @.@ 5 knots ( 52 @.@ 8 km / h ; 32 @.@ 8 mph ) . <unk> carried 1 @,@ 300 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 300 long tons ) of coal , and an additional 200 tonnes ( 200 long tons ) of oil that gave her a range of approximately 5 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 9 @,@ 300 km ; 5 @,@ 800 mi ) at 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) . <unk> had a crew of 18 officers and 355 enlisted men . 
 The ship was armed with twelve 10 @.@ 5 cm SK L / 45 guns in single pedestal mounts . Two were placed side by side forward on the forecastle , eight were located amidships , four on either side , and two were side by side aft . The guns had a maximum elevation of 30 degrees , which allowed them to engage targets out to 12 @,@ 700 m ( 41 @,@ 700 ft ) . They were supplied with 1 @,@ 800 rounds of ammunition , for 150 shells per gun . She was also equipped with a pair of 50 cm ( 19 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes with five torpedoes submerged in the hull on the broadside . She could also carry 120 mines . The ship was protected by a waterline armored belt that was 60 mm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) thick amidships . The conning tower had 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) thick sides , and the deck was covered with up to 60 mm thick armor plate . 
 On 6 August , <unk> rendezvoused with the passenger ship SS Kronprinz Wilhelm about 120 nmi ( 220 km ; 140 mi ) north of <unk> Island . <unk> was in the process of transferring guns and equipment to the liner when <unk> , in his flagship HMS Suffolk , appeared to the south . The Germans had only managed to transfer two 8 @.@ 8 cm guns , a machine gun , and some sailors by the time Suffolk arrived . The two ships quickly departed in different directions ; Suffolk followed <unk> and other cruisers were ordered to intercept her . <unk> 's faster speed allowed her to quickly <unk> <unk> , but at 20 : 15 , Bristol joined the pursuit and briefly fired on the German cruiser . The German gunners scored two hits on Bristol during the short engagement . <unk> turned east and again used her high speed to evade the British ships . The British failed to relocate her , and by 9 August , <unk> reached Puerto Rico with only 12 tons of coal in her bunkers . 
 With limited options for coal in the Caribbean , <unk> took his ship down to the northeast coast of Brazil , off <unk> . The area was not as heavily patrolled by the British . Here , <unk> had easy access to coal supplies , either from chartered <unk> or captured vessels . <unk> frequently kept one or two prizes to assist in the search for targets . In the course of her patrols off the Brazilian coast , <unk> sank or captured sixteen merchant ships . These <unk> , fifteen British ships and one Dutch vessel , totaled 72 @,@ 805 gross register tons ( <unk> ) . <unk> then decided to move to another area , as remaining in one area would increase his chances of being tracked down by the British . He turned his ship toward the West Indies to attack Barbados and Fort @-@ de @-@ France and the shipping lanes between Barbados and Trinidad . 
 Hurricane Guillermo was the ninth most intense Pacific hurricane on record , attaining peak winds of 160 mph ( 260 km / h ) and a barometric pressure of <unk> hPa ( 27 @.@ 14 inHg ) . Forming out of a tropical wave on July 30 , 1997 , roughly 345 mi ( 555 km ) south of <unk> Cruz , Mexico , Guillermo tracked in a steady west @-@ northwestward direction while intensifying . The system reached hurricane status by August 1 before undergoing rapid intensification the following day . At the end of this phase , the storm attained its peak intensity as a powerful Category 5 hurricane . The storm began to weaken during the afternoon of August 5 and was downgraded to a tropical storm on August 8 . Once entering the Central Pacific Hurricane Center 's area of responsibility , Guillermo briefly weakened to a tropical depression before re @-@ attaining tropical storm status . On August 15 , the storm reached an unusually high latitude of 41 @.@ 8 ° N before transitioning into an extratropical cyclone . The remnants persisted for more than a week as they tracked towards the northeast and later south and east before being absorbed by a larger extratropical system off the coast of California on August 24 . 
 Throughout Guillermo 's track , the storm never threatened any major <unk> , resulting in little impact on land . However , because of its extreme intensity , it produced large swells across the Pacific Ocean , affecting areas from Hawaii to coastal Mexico . Along the American Pacific coast , three people drowned amid high waves , two in Baja California and one in California . At its peak , Guillermo was the second strongest known Pacific hurricane on record ; however , it has since been surpassed by five other storms , including Linda later that year . The effects of Guillermo were not deemed severe enough to justify retirement of its name . 
 Hurricane Guillermo began its extensive track as a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on July 16 , 1997 . Initially disorganized and weak , the system tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean for several weeks . The National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) stated that they had issues monitoring the system as it moved through the Caribbean ; however , they interpreted through satellite data that the wave crossed Central America and entered the Pacific Ocean between July 27 and 28 . Once in the Pacific , convection , areas of thunderstorm activity , and banding features began to form . Additionally , a low pressure system developed within the disturbance by July 29 . The following day , the system became sufficiently organized for the NHC to classify it as Tropical Depression Nine @-@ E ; at this time the depression was situated roughly 345 mi ( 555 km ) south of <unk> Cruz , Mexico . In response to a deep @-@ layer ridge to the north , the depression tracked at a steady pace towards the west @-@ northwest , and this motion persisted through the first week of August . Within a day of being classified , the system intensified into Tropical Storm Guillermo , the seventh named storm of the 1997 season . 
 By the afternoon of August 1 , a strong central dense <unk> , an area of high , thick clouds , developed over the center of circulation , prompting the NHC to upgrade it to a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson Hurricane Scale . Throughout the next day , the system gradually developed an eye within the central dense <unk> , leading to further strengthening . Operationally , Guillermo was thought to have briefly leveled out in intensity on August 2 ; however , in post @-@ storm analysis , the NHC discovered that a steady period of rapid intensification took place . Unlike most hurricanes in the eastern Pacific , Guillermo was investigated by Hurricane Hunters reconnaissance aircraft during its rapid intensification stage . The aircraft released several <unk> into the storm to gather meteorological data . This mission marked the first time the Hurricane Hunters recorded high @-@ resolution wind data from flight level to within several meters of the ocean surface inside the eyewall of a major hurricane . 
 Radar was also employed to determine the size of the hurricane 's eye , stated to be roughly 13 mi ( 20 km ) in diameter , following a 6 @-@ mile ( 10 km ) decrease due to the strengthening . Light wind shear surrounding the hurricane allowed further strengthening to take place . Late on August 2 , the system attained winds of 135 mph ( 215 km / h ) , making it a Category 4 storm . During the afternoon of August 3 , Guillermo nearly attained Category 5 intensity as it reached its initial peak intensity with winds of 155 mph ( 250 km / h ) along with a barometric pressure estimated at <unk> mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 32 inHg ) . A brief period of weakening took place later that day before further strengthening ensued . Late on August 4 , Guillermo intensified into a Category 5 hurricane , attaining peak winds of 160 mph ( 260 km / h ) . Operational analysis of satellite information indicated a minimum pressure of <unk> mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 2 inHg ) ; however , post @-@ storm studies stated that the pressure was more likely around <unk> mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 14 inHg ) . 
 At its peak , cloud temperatures within the eyewall were estimated to be as low as − 79 ° C ( − 110 ° F ) . Using the Dvorak technique , a method used to estimate the intensity of tropical cyclones , a value of 7 @.@ 6 was obtained . This indicated that maximum winds at the surface could have been as high as 181 mph ( 291 km / h ) ; however , this was not used as the reported intensity as <unk> to twelve @-@ hour averages indicated sustained winds around 160 mph ( 260 km / h ) . After maintaining this intensity for roughly 18 hours , the system began to weaken as it moved into a less favorable environment with moderate wind shear . Cloud temperatures within the eyewall also began to increase , indicating that the hurricane was losing intensity . 
 <unk> weakening took place over the following several days , and the storm dropped below major hurricane status on August 6 . By August 8 , Guillermo moved over colder waters and was downgraded to a tropical storm as sustained winds dropped below 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) . Around this time , the storm started to move along the western edge of the ridge that previously steered it towards the west @-@ northwest , causing Guillermo to turn northwest . On August 9 , the storm crossed longitude 140 ° W , denoting a shift in warning responsibility from the NHC to the Central Pacific Hurricane Center ( CPHC ) . Not long after crossing into the CPHC 's area of responsibility , the storm further weakened to a tropical depression as it moved over 24 ° C ( 75 ° F ) waters . 
 Although most tropical cyclones generally weaken as they increase in latitude , warm waters of 26 ° C ( 79 ° F ) allowed Guillermo to re @-@ intensify into a tropical storm on August 11 . Gradually , the storm attained winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) before succumbing to cooler waters further north . The storm weakened to a tropical depression once more on August 15 , situated well to the north of the Hawaiian islands . Later that day , Guillermo transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at an unusually high latitude of 41 @.@ 8 ° N , roughly 850 mi ( 1 @,@ 370 km ) south @-@ southeast of <unk> , Alaska . Over the following days , the remnants of the hurricane turned northeastward towards the Pacific coast of North America . On August 19 , the system moved within 575 mi ( <unk> km ) of Vancouver Island , British Columbia before Guillermo tracked southward . Over the following few days , the system slowed significantly and turned towards the east . By August 20 , moisture from the remnants of Tropical Storm <unk> were entrained into the eastern portion of Guillermo 's circulation . On August 24 , the low was finally absorbed by a larger extratropical system while situated roughly 345 mi ( 555 km ) off of the northern California coastline . 
 Along the Pacific coast of Mexico , 12 @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) surf produced by Hurricane Guillermo affected numerous beaches . From Cabo San Lucas to San José del Cabo , the storm sent waves from the Gulf of California over the grounds of <unk> resorts . <unk> were driven off some of Cabo 's most popular beaches by the rough ocean conditions which flooded homes situated along the coast . Two <unk> were killed after being swept out to sea . 
 Due to accurate <unk> , emergency officials across California were able to close off swimming zones and warn the public about dangerous rip currents prior to their arrival . Guillermo generated heavy surf across the beaches of Southern California . Heights from the surf averaged 6 to 8 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 to 2 @.@ 4 m ) with local areas reaching above 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) , favorable to around 500 <unk> at an annual competition at Huntington Beach . According to the Los Angeles Times , some waves reached heights of 15 to 18 ft ( 4 @.@ 6 to 5 @.@ 5 m ) . Over 100 rescues were reported by local <unk> . Waves ranging from 6 to 12 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 to 3 @.@ 7 m ) also affected Orange County . Hundreds of people were rescued , but rip currents were blamed for three injuries and one death . On August 5 , about a mile north of Huntington Beach pier , a 19 @-@ year @-@ old man was swept away . His body was recovered several days later . On August 6 , a teenage boy and girl were injured on a beach in <unk> Del <unk> , while an 18 @-@ year @-@ old was pulled ashore and sent to the hospital with neck injuries . In Newport Beach , <unk> made nearly 300 rescues on August 5 and 6 alone . 
 In addition to coastal impacts , the system brought a surge of warm , moist air into southern California , bringing temperatures in some areas as high as 110 ° F ( 43 ° C ) . Between August 15 and 17 , large waves generated while it was at peak intensity came ashore in Hawaii . The swells caused no damage and reached heights of 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) in eastern @-@ facing shores of the state . 
 Hurricane Guillermo 's central pressure of <unk> mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 14 inHg ) established it as the second most intense Pacific hurricane on record behind Hurricane Ava of 1973 . However , later in the 1997 season , Hurricane Linda set a new intensity record , and in subsequent years hurricanes Kenna , <unk> , Rick , Marie , Odile and Patricia all achieved lower pressures , leaving Guillermo in ninth place . Guillermo persisted for 16 @.@ 5 days from its classification as a tropical depression to its transition into an extratropical storm , making it the sixth longest @-@ lasting storm in the basin . 
 The 1st Army Group was a Royal Yugoslav Army formation commanded by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> during the German @-@ led Axis invasion of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in April 1941 during World War II . It consisted of the 4th Army , 7th Army , and the 1st Cavalry Division , which was the army group reserve . It was responsible for the defence of northwestern Yugoslavia , with the 4th Army defending the western sector along the Yugoslav @-@ Hungarian border , and the 7th Army defending the eastern sector along the Reich and Italian borders . 
 The 4th Army also began to withdraw southwards on 9 April , and on 10 April it quickly ceased to exist as an operational formation in the face of two determined armoured <unk> by the <unk> <unk> Corps , one of which captured Zagreb that evening . Italian offensive operations also began , with <unk> towards <unk> and down the Adriatic coast , capturing over 30 @,@ 000 Yugoslav troops near <unk> . On 12 April , a German armoured column linked up with the Italians near the Adriatic coast , <unk> the remnants of the withdrawing 7th Army . When fifth column elements arrested the staffs of 1st Army Group , 4th Army and 7th Army at <unk> , the 1st Army Group effectively ceased to exist . Remnants of the 4th Army attempted to establish defensive positions in northeastern Bosnia , but were quickly brushed aside by German armour as it drove towards Sarajevo . The Yugoslav High Command <unk> surrendered on 18 April . 
 The Royal Yugoslav Army ( <unk> @-@ Croatian : <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> ) was formed after World War I as the army of the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes ( Kingdom of <unk> ) , when that country was created on 1 December 1918 . To defend the new kingdom , an army was formed around the nucleus of the victorious Royal Serbian Army combined with armed formations raised in the former parts of the Austro @-@ Hungarian Empire that joined with the Kingdom of Serbia to form the new state . Many former Austro @-@ Hungarian officers and soldiers became members of the new army . From its beginning , the army , like other aspects of public life in the new kingdom , was dominated by ethnic Serbs , who saw the army as a means by which to secure Serb <unk> in the new kingdom . 
 The development of the army was hampered by the poor economy of the kingdom , and this continued through the 1920s . In 1929 , King Alexander changed the name of the country to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia , at which time the army became the <unk> . The army budget remained tight , and as tensions rose across Europe during the 1930s , it became hard to secure weapons and munitions from other countries . Consequently , at the time World War II broke out in September 1939 , the <unk> had several serious weaknesses , which included reliance on draught animals for transport , and the large size of its formations . For example , infantry divisions had a wartime strength of 26 @,@ 000 – 27 @,@ 000 men , as compared to contemporary British infantry divisions of half that strength . These characteristics resulted in slow , unwieldy formations , and the inadequate supply of arms and munitions meant that even the very large Yugoslav formations had low firepower . Older generals better suited to the trench warfare of World War I , were combined with an army that was not equipped or trained to resist the fast @-@ moving combined arms approach used by the Germans in Poland and France . 
 The weaknesses of the <unk> in strategy , structure , equipment , mobility and supply were exacerbated to a significant degree by the lack of unity across Yugoslavia which had resulted from two decades of Serb <unk> , and the attendant lack of political legitimacy achieved by the central government . Attempts to address the lack of unity came too late to ensure that the <unk> was a cohesive force . Fifth column activity was also a serious concern , not only from the Croatian nationalist Ustaše , but from the <unk> and ethnic German minorities in the country . 
 German Army headquarters wanted to capture the bridges over the <unk> intact , and from 1 April had issued orders to the German 2nd Army to conduct preliminary operations aimed at seizing the bridge at <unk> and the railway bridge northeast of <unk> by coup de main . As a result , limited objective attacks were launched along the line of the <unk> by the <unk> <unk> Corps , despite the fact that they were not expected to launch offensive operations until 10 April . Similar operations occurred on the extreme left flank of the 4th Army , where raiding parties and patrols from <unk> Infantry Corps seized the high ground on the south side of the <unk> . 
 When the Germans began to expand their bridgehead at <unk> , the rebel Croat troops at <unk> made contact with them , and the 4th Army began to withdraw southwards on 9 April . On the night of 9 / 10 April , those Croats that had remained with their units began to desert or turn on their commanders . The 27th Infantry Division <unk> suffered from similar <unk> , which eased the German capture of <unk> . 
 The activities of <unk> and his council continued from the day the invasion commenced , and the Yugoslav High Command soon ordered their arrest . However , the chief of staff of the headquarters of the 1st Army Group , <unk> General Leon <unk> and the head of the operations staff , <unk> Franjo <unk> did not carry out the orders . On 9 April , the 6th Air Reconnaissance Group airfield at <unk> was again attacked by German aircraft . 
 Early on 10 April , <unk> left his post and visited the senior Ustaše leader <unk> Kvaternik in Zagreb . He then returned to the headquarters and <unk> 4th Army units around Zagreb to either cease operations or to deploy to <unk> positions . These actions reduced or eliminated armed resistance to the German advance . 
 About 17 : 45 on 10 April , Kvaternik and SS @-@ <unk> ( Colonel ) Edmund <unk> went to the radio station in Zagreb and Kvaternik proclaimed the creation of the Independent State of Croatia . By 19 : 30 on 10 April , despite initial resistance , lead elements of the 14th Panzer Division had reached the outskirts of Zagreb , having covered nearly 160 kilometres ( 99 miles ) in a single day . By the time it entered Zagreb , the 14th Panzer Division was met by cheering crowds , and had captured 15 @,@ 000 Yugoslav troops , and 22 generals , including both <unk> and <unk> . Held up by freezing weather and snow storms , on 10 April , on the following day <unk> Corps was approaching Zagreb from the north , and bicycle @-@ mounted troops of the <unk> Infantry Division had turned east to capture <unk> , along with an entire Yugoslav brigade including its commanding general . On the same day , the German @-@ installed interim Croatian government called on all Croats to stop fighting , and in the evening , <unk> Infantry Corps entered Zagreb and relieved the 14th Panzer Division . In the face of the assault by the 14th Panzer Division , the 4th Army quickly ceased to exist as an operational formation . The disintegration of the 4th Army was caused largely by fifth column activity , as it was involved in little fighting . 
 During the night of 9 / 10 April , lead elements of the <unk> Mountain Corps , consisting of the 1st Mountain Division de @-@ trained and crossed the border near <unk> and advanced southeast towards <unk> , reaching a point about 19 kilometres ( 12 mi ) from the town by evening . Luftwaffe reconnaissance sorties revealed that the main body of the 7th Army was withdrawing towards Zagreb , leaving behind light forces to maintain contact with the German <unk> . When it received this information , 2nd Army headquarters ordered <unk> Corps to form motorised columns to pursue the 7th Army south , but extreme weather conditions and flooding of the <unk> at <unk> on 10 April slowed the German pursuit . 
 On 10 April , as the situation had become increasingly desperate throughout the country , <unk> <unk> , who was both the Prime Minister and Yugoslav Chief of the General Staff , had broadcast the following message : 
 All troops must engage the enemy wherever encountered and with every means at their disposal . Don 't wait for direct orders from above , but act on your own and be guided by your judgement , initiative , and conscience . 
 " Open Your Heart " is a song by American singer Madonna from her third studio album True Blue ( 1986 ) . It was released as the album 's fourth single in November 12 , 1986 by Sire Records . It has since appeared remixed on the compilation albums The Immaculate Collection ( 1990 ) and Celebration ( 2009 ) . Originally a rock ' n roll song with the title " Follow Your Heart " , it was written for singer <unk> <unk> by songwriters Gardner Cole and Peter <unk> , although it was never played to her . Since Madonna 's management was looking for new songs for True Blue , she accepted it . Madonna altered some of the lyrics and changed the composition to suit the dance @-@ pop genre , giving her a co @-@ writer credit for the song . Lyrically " Open Your Heart " is a love song , talking about innocent feelings of boy @-@ meets @-@ girl romance and Madonna expressing her sexual desire . 
 The song was well received by critics who commended it for being a simple love song . It was also successful commercially , reaching the top @-@ ten of the charts in Belgium , Canada , Ireland , Italy , Netherlands , and the United Kingdom , also reaching the top of Billboard Hot 100 in the United States , thus making it Madonna 's fifth US number @-@ one single . The music video , however , portrayed a different concept of the song . Madonna played an exotic dancer in a <unk> @-@ show club , who befriends a little boy and subsequently escapes . It was critically acclaimed for portraying a completely opposite perspective of " <unk> male gaze and object " , and depicting innocence rather than sexual overtones , although the entry of a child in a strip club was negatively criticized . The video was an homage to actresses <unk> <unk> and Marlene <unk> . 
 " Open Your Heart " has been performed by Madonna in three of her world tours – 1987 's Who 's That Girl World Tour , 1990 's <unk> Ambition World Tour , where Madonna wore her infamous conical bra during the song , and 2012 's The <unk> Tour . The performances were included in the respective video release of the tours . " Open Your Heart " has been covered a number of times by different artists , and appeared in the Britney Spears film , Crossroads ( 2002 ) . 
 " Open Your Heart " was originally a rock ' n roll song with the title " Follow Your Heart " and had been written for singer <unk> <unk> by songwriters Gardner Cole and Peter <unk> , although it was never played to her . The Temptations were also considered for the song . Their manager Benny <unk> decided that they wanted to record the song after all , but upon hearing that Madonna had already recorded it , changed their mind . The original title according to Cole , was from a local health food restaurant called Follow Your Heart in <unk> Park , California , where he was in love with a <unk> named Lisa and she was the original inspiration for the lyrics . In Fred Bronson 's book The Billboard Book of Number 1 Hits , Cole explained , 
 " Peter and I usually write very quickly . It 's usually a day or two a song , but for some reason this didn 't really hit us as a hit song . We didn 't give up on it . We just kept working on it over the course of a year . Thank God we did . [ ... ] It was the first song that was cut on the True Blue album . It made me nervous as a writer , because a lot of times the very first song that gets cut doesn 't make it in the long run . But the song ended up making the album , which really opened up a lot of doors for me . " 
 Cole 's manager Bennett <unk> was working with Madonna 's management and they were looking for new material for her album . Three of Cole 's songs were chosen for reviewing , including " Open Your Heart " . Madonna 's manager <unk> <unk> <unk> the song and thought it would be a hit for Madonna and he asked Cole to re @-@ demo a female demo version . Her female backup singer , <unk> De <unk> was Cole 's girlfriend and he immediately asked her to sing the demo . Despite the fact that it did not fit exactly with the choice and genre of songs Madonna was singing at that time , she nevertheless accepted it . Madonna recorded " Open Your Heart " , altered the lyrics thus earning a co @-@ writing credit , and along with Patrick Leonard added a bassline underneath the song which turned it into a rock @-@ dance track rather than the original rock ' n roll genre . The song was the first recorded cut for the True Blue album in late 1985 and ultimately made it to the final released <unk> . 
 " Open Your Heart " has a continuous percussion filled structure and a chorus sounding like <unk> Carlisle , according to author <unk> <unk> in his book The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna . Lyrically , " Open Your Heart " is a simple love song . The song speaks of earnest innocent notions of boy meets girl kind of feelings . According to Professor Mavis <unk> , the phrase " Open Your Heart " is a metaphor for the act of being vulnerable that corresponds to the behavior involved in developing an intimate or close relationship . The following lines in the song , " Open Your Heart , I 'll make you love me ; It 's not that hard , if you just turn the key " illustrate this metaphor <unk> . The concept of the song places Madonna as a victim of love . 
 The lyrics puts Madonna in a more direct position expressing her sexual desires for her man according to author Santiago <unk> @-@ <unk> in the line " If you gave me half a chance you 'd see ; My desire burning inside of me . " According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing , " Open Your Heart " is written in the time signature of common time with a medium funk tempo of 112 beats per minute . It is composed in the key of F major with Madonna 's voice spanning from <unk> to B ♭ 4 . The song follows a basic sequence of F – E ♭ 9 – E ♭ / G – <unk> – F as its chord progression . 
 " Open Your Heart " debuted at number 51 the week ending December 6 , 1986 , on the Billboard Hot 100 chart . It had a gradual rise and subsequently topped the chart on February 7 , 1987 , becoming Madonna 's fifth number @-@ one single on the Billboard Hot 100 . The single also had success on Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart , reaching number @-@ one on February 14 , 1987 . It also became Madonna 's sixth entry on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart where it reached a peak of number 12 . In Canada , the song debuted at number 83 on the RPM chart on December 13 , 1986 , and reached a peak position of number eight for the chart dated February 21 , 1987 . It placed at number 68 on the RPM Year @-@ end chart for 1987 . 
 <unk> , it became a top ten hit in several European countries including the United Kingdom , Italy , Ireland , Netherlands , and Belgium . In the United Kingdom , the single debuted on the UK Singles Chart at number eight and subsequently reached a peak of number four on December 13 , 1986 . The single was on the chart for nine weeks in total , and was certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry ( BPI ) on December 1 , 1986 . According to the Official Charts Company , the song has sold 195 @,@ 000 copies there . It also peaked at number four in Europe , thus becoming the only single from True Blue not to top the <unk> Hot 100 . In Australia , it only reached a peak of number 16 , breaking a run of nine consecutive top ten singles for Madonna in that country . Elsewhere like in Switzerland , Austria , Germany and France , it reached within the top 40 of the singles chart . 
 The music video was shot at Echo Park in Los Angeles , California . Madonna portrays an exotic dancer who befriends a young boy , played by child actor Felix Howard . This video was originally set to be directed by Madonna 's then @-@ husband Sean Penn , but in the end the final honors went to Jean @-@ Baptiste <unk> , who went on to work with Madonna on her videos for " <unk> My Love " ( 1990 ) , " Human Nature " ( 1995 ) , " Love Don 't Live Here <unk> " ( 1996 ) , " Don 't Tell Me " ( 2000 ) and " Hollywood " ( 2003 ) . The video was shot in July 1986 and was released in December 1986 . It was produced by David <unk> . The video was nominated for three MTV Video Music Awards in 1987 . In the Best Female Video category , " Open Your Heart " lost to another Madonna video , when the music video for " Papa Don 't <unk> " won the award . The video has been ranked at number 35 on VH1 's " 50 <unk> Video <unk> " of all time . 
 The video is structured as a cinematic <unk> show and <unk> that portrays Madonna as a <unk> . According to <unk> , the <unk> show was his idea since at that time , " we were into a period where we were experimenting [ with ] some kind of freedom about the body , about sexuality and stuff " . He wanted to have a " naive and sweet " feel with the portrayal of a boy waiting outside for Madonna . They built the set from scratch , including the frontal part with the ticket booth . Although it looked fake , <unk> liked it saying " I like the <unk> of it . I haven 't seen it for a long time , but when I saw it once again , I said , ' It 's so <unk> ' . It 's kind of badly done , which I like , compared to today . We didn 't have the same equipment , people are more <unk> today , but there 's something sweet about it . " Madonna was initially asked by him to wear a black wig , and the initial reaction to the whole wardrobe was positive . But Madonna wanted <unk> 's opinion on the whole ensemble , who replied that she would look better as a blonde . So the wig was kept for the initial scenes of the video only . 
 The dancing is restrained with a single prop : that of a solitary chair . At one point in the first segment of the video , she is filmed dancing but the camera is almost still and the motions of the dance are confined within the small range of the camera . As the screens inside the viewing <unk> open and close , the camera <unk> the shots of Madonna each with its own angle and duration . The same imagery is exhibited by the little boy outside who tries to frame Madonna 's <unk> image into different angles . There are four other men in the <unk> who are made of wood with paintings of artist Tamara de <unk> on them . Madonna at one point takes off her gloves like Rita <unk> in Gilda and points towards one of the wooden paintings . It collapses and she blows on her finger . 
 The video is similar in thematic content to <unk> <unk> 's video for the single " Girls , Girls , Girls " . But in contrast , this video tells the story from Madonna 's point of view . She looks down into the <unk> to make eye contact with the men but they are unable to return it . She also looks <unk> into the camera , making eye contact with the viewer . With these scenes Madonna portrays her holding power over the men and the ability to pursue them . Madonna represents an assertive woman searching for a lover who can accept her as a human being . Author Bruce Forbes notes that the men in the <unk> are proved unworthy of her and there is an <unk> of mockery when Madonna addresses them as ' baby ' while shaking her body . 
 By the end of the video the isolated and sad men depart with the doors closing on them . As the final chorus breaks into dance grooves , Madonna comes out of the theater and gives the boy a quick kiss on his lips . Both are clad in loose @-@ fitting gray suits , which gives Madonna an <unk> look . They <unk> away <unk> in the <unk> , reminiscent of Charlie <unk> and Jack <unk> in The Kid with the old boss pursuing them and shouting " Come back , come back , we still need you " in Italian . The tension between the visual and the musical dimensions of the video is extremely unsettling according to author Nicholas B. <unk> . Only when she disappears from the <unk> and reappears to run away from her patriarchal boss with the young boy , then the music and visuals become comparable . 
 " Open Your Heart " has been featured as a full song in the set lists of three Madonna tours – 1987 's Who 's That Girl World Tour , 1990 's <unk> Ambition World Tour , and 2012 's The <unk> Tour . It served as the opening song on 1987 Who 's That Girl Tour . It started off with then young dancer Chris Finch , imitating Felix Howard from the video . Howard did not receive a working license for the tour hence Finch was taken for his part . He went on to become an integral part of most of the songs performed on the tour . After Finch , two other dancers are introduced , before Madonna herself appears on stage . She wore the same black <unk> <unk> and <unk> as in the music video . She first sings the song alone , then Finch joins her again and they dance together till the song ends . Two different performances of the song on this tour can be found on the videos : Who 's That Girl : Live in Japan , filmed in Tokyo , Japan , on June 22 , 1987 , and <unk> <unk> : Live from Italy , filmed in Turin , Italy , on September 4 , 1987 . 
 The opening musical introduction of the song served as a brief twenty @-@ six seconds musical interlude on the <unk> World Tour in 2001 . As Madonna finished a performance of " Frozen " in the <unk> inspired segment of the show , she sat in a cross @-@ legged position in front of the stage . The musical intro for " Open Your Heart " would start with a dancer in a Japanese costume dancing behind her on a raised podium . As the music ends , Madonna starts singing " Nobody 's Perfect " from her 2000 album Music . In 2008 , Madonna sang the first verse and chorus at two dates — Las Vegas and East Rutherford — of her <unk> & Sweet Tour . Madonna <unk> the lyrics at the Vegas show and refused to sing the song in Boston ; she performed " Express Yourself " instead . 
 Red <unk> 's Treasure ( French : Le <unk> de <unk> le Rouge ) is the twelfth volume of The Adventures of Tintin , the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé . The story was serialised daily in Le Soir , Belgium 's leading francophone newspaper , from February to September 1943 amidst the German occupation of Belgium during World War II . <unk> an arc begun in The Secret of the Unicorn , the story tells of young reporter Tintin and his friend Captain Haddock as they launch an expedition to the Caribbean to locate the treasure of the pirate Red <unk> . 
 Red <unk> 's Treasure was a commercial success and was published in book form by Casterman the year following its conclusion . Hergé continued The Adventures of Tintin with The Seven Crystal <unk> , while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco @-@ Belgian comics tradition . Red <unk> 's Treasure has been cited as one of the most important installments in the series for marking the first appearance of eccentric scientist <unk> <unk> , who subsequently became a core character . The story has been variously adapted for both the 1957 <unk> animated series , Hergé 's Adventures of Tintin , and for the 1991 animated series The Adventures of Tintin by <unk> and <unk> , as well as for the feature film The Adventures of Tintin : The Secret of the Unicorn ( 2011 ) . 
 Tintin and his friend Captain Haddock plan an expedition to the West Indies aboard a fishing trawler , the Sirius , to search for the treasure of the pirate Red <unk> . Having previously read three <unk> authored by Haddock 's ancestor , Sir Francis Haddock , the duo had discovered the coordinates to what they believe is the treasure aboard the sunken 17th century vessel , the Unicorn . An eccentric , hard @-@ of @-@ hearing inventor named Professor <unk> <unk> offers to aid them with the use of his shark @-@ shaped one @-@ man submarine , but they decline his assistance . Setting sail , they are joined by the police detectives Thomson and Thompson and soon discover that <unk> has <unk> away on board , bringing his submarine with him . 
 When they reach the coordinates shown on the <unk> , there is no wreckage in sight . Frustrated , Haddock <unk> turning back , but Tintin soon realizes the problem : If Sir Francis had used a French instead of an English chart to calculate the position , the coordinates would have been measured on the Paris Meridian rather than the Greenwich Meridian . As they have been using the Greenwich Meridian , they realise that they are too far west . 
 After traveling to the correct position , they discover an unknown island . There , they find a statue of Sir Francis Haddock and other evidence ; Tintin <unk> that Francis Haddock had taken refuge on the island and that the wreck of the Unicorn must be nearby . They locate the wreck using <unk> ' submarine and recover various artefacts from it , but do not find the treasure . Among the artefacts is a <unk> containing old documents revealing that Sir Francis Haddock had been the owner of the country estate <unk> Hall . Back in Belgium , <unk> purchases the Hall using funds from the sale of his submarine design , and gives it to Haddock . Tintin and Haddock search the house 's <unk> , where Tintin spots a statue of Saint John the Evangelist holding a cross with a globe and eagle at its feet . Tintin suddenly remembers that Francis Haddock 's original three <unk> said , " For ' tis from the light that light will dawn , and then shines forth the Eagle 's cross " and realises that this message referred , not to the location of the Unicorn , but to Saint John " the eagle " : his traditional symbol . Tintin locates the island on the globe , presses a secret button he finds there , and discovers Red <unk> 's treasure hidden inside . 
 <unk> the German occupation of Belgium during World War II , Hergé had accepted a position working for Le Soir , Belgian 's largest French @-@ language daily newspaper . <unk> from its original owners , Le Soir was permitted by the German authorities to reopen under the directorship of Belgian editor Raymond de Becker , although it remained firmly under Nazi control , supporting the German war effort and <unk> anti @-@ Semitism . After joining Le Soir on 15 October 1940 , Hergé became editor of its new children 's supplement Le Soir Jeunesse , with the help of an old friend , Paul <unk> , and the cartoonist Jacques Van <unk> , before paper shortages forced Tintin to be serialised daily in the main pages of Le Soir . Some Belgians were upset that Hergé was willing to work for a newspaper controlled by the occupying Nazi administration , although he was heavily <unk> by the size of Le Soir 's readership , which numbered some 600 @,@ 000 . Faced with the reality of Nazi oversight , Hergé abandoned the overt political themes that had <unk> much of his earlier work , instead adopting a policy of neutrality . Entertainment producer and author Harry Thompson observed that , without the need to <unk> political types , " Hergé was now concentrating more on plot and on developing a new style of character comedy . The public reacted positively . " 
 Red <unk> 's Treasure was to be the second half of a series of connected events in two parts which had begun with the previous adventure , The Secret of the Unicorn . This two @-@ part series was the first that Hergé had produced since Cigars of the Pharaoh and The Blue Lotus ( 1934 – 36 ) . However , as Tintin expert Michael Farr related , whereas Cigars of the Pharaoh and The Blue Lotus had been largely " self @-@ sufficient and self @-@ contained " , the connection between The Secret of the Unicorn and Red <unk> 's Treasure was to be far closer . 
 The brief appearance of Dr. <unk> , who warns Haddock to cease drinking alcohol , was an allusion to Hergé 's own physician , Dr. <unk> . Hergé made a comical reference to the French comedian <unk> <unk> in the story by advertising a play by <unk> titled Me in which <unk> himself plays every role . The adventure was the first to depict Tintin wearing a white shirt under a blue <unk> ; this would go on to become the character 's iconic costume . 
 Le <unk> De <unk> Le Rouge began serialisation as a daily strip in Le Soir from 19 February 1943 . The title of the new adventure had been announced in an advertisement in the newspaper two days previously . In Belgium , it was then published in a 62 @-@ page book format by <unk> Casterman in 1944 . Red <unk> 's Treasure contained one of Hergé 's two favourite illustrations from The Adventures of Tintin . It combines three actions <unk> a sequence of events into one drawing : Haddock <unk> up the beach in the foreground , the <unk> being brought ashore in the middle ground , and the Sirius weighing anchor in the background . 
 Rather than immediately embark on the creation of a new Tintin adventure , Hergé agreed to a proposal that Le Soir 's crime writer , Paul <unk> , would author a detective story featuring Thomson and Thompson . The story was titled <unk> et <unk> , <unk> ( Thomson and Thompson , <unk> ) , and was illustrated by Hergé . 
 The Secret of the Unicorn and Red <unk> 's Treasure were the first two Adventures of Tintin to be published in English @-@ language translations for the British market . Published by Casterman , these two editions did not sell well , and have since become rare collector 's items . They would be republished for the British market seven years later , this time by <unk> with translations provided by Michael Turner and Leslie <unk> @-@ Cooper . Farr reported that Red <unk> 's Treasure is the best @-@ selling story in The Adventures of Tintin , while Harry Thompson referred to The Secret of the Unicorn @-@ Red <unk> 's Treasure arc as " the most successful of all Tintin 's adventures " . 
 Harry Thompson stated that the <unk> of the Unicorn @-@ Red <unk> 's Treasure arc marked the beginning of the third and central stage of " Tintin 's career " . He furthermore stated that in these two stories , Tintin has been converted from a reporter into an explorer to cope with the new political climate . He stated that in this story , Hergé " abandons the complex plotting of The Secret of the Unicorn in favour of an episodic style of adventure not seen since the early books " . Thompson further draws attention to the arrival of <unk> in the story , describing him as the " third and final member " of Tintin 's " family " . Thompson was critical of the use of colour in the story , stating that much of it looks better in black @-@ and @-@ white , as it was originally printed in Le Soir . 
 Hergé biographer Benoît Peeters observed that both The Secret of the Unicorn and Red <unk> 's Treasure " hold a crucial position " in The Adventures of Tintin as it establishes the " Tintin universe " with its core set of characters . He felt that while religious elements had been present in previous stories , they were even stronger in The Secret of the Unicorn and its sequel , something which he attributed to Van <unk> 's influence . Peeters believed that Red <unk> 's Treasure was " an <unk> book " because it is the volume in which the " family " — meaning Tintin , Snowy , Haddock , and <unk> — all come together . Fellow biographer Pierre Assouline echoed this idea , noting that Hergé had " settled " the three characters in their new home . Focusing on the character of <unk> , he noted that the idea of the eccentric professor was " so universal that it would be inaccurate to point to any one source " , suggesting possible influences from Charlie <unk> and Hergé 's own father . For Assouline , the professor embodies " the gentle madness and subtle humour in comic strips " . He added that both Red <unk> 's Treasure and its predecessor " reveal Hergé at a new level in his art " , and suggested that the reason for their popularity lay in the fact that they were " the visual continuation of a literary universe that stretches from Jules Verne to Pierre <unk> " . 
 Jean @-@ Marc <unk> and Randy <unk> opined that The Secret of the Unicorn @-@ Red <unk> 's Treasure arc represents " a turning point " for the series as it shifts the reader 's attention from Tintin to Haddock , who has become " by far , the most interesting character " . They claim that the introduction of <unk> " completes the indispensable triangle that <unk> Tintin with its mythic quality . " <unk> that here , Hergé 's " art has reached a degree of near @-@ perfection " , they awarded it five stars out of five . 
 Michael Farr said that the scene introducing <unk> was " a comic tour de force " marking the start of the " rich vein of humour " that the character brought to the series . <unk> that unlike The <unk> Star , this two @-@ book story arc contains " scarcely an allusion to occupation and war " , he praised the arc 's narrative as " perfectly paced , without that feeling of <unk> " present in some of Hergé 's earlier work . 
 In his <unk> study of the Adventures of Tintin , the academic Jean @-@ Marie Apostolidès characterised the Secret of the Unicorn @-@ Red <unk> 's Treasure arc as being about the characters going on a " treasure hunt that turns out to be at the same time a search for their roots . " He stated that the arc revolves around Haddock 's ancestry , and in doing so " deals with the meanings of symbolic relations within personal life " . Highlighting that <unk> was one of many eccentric scientists to have appeared in the series , he nonetheless emphasises his difference by noting that <unk> approaches Tintin , rather than Tintin approaching him , as the young reporter had done with previous scientists . Commenting on the introduction of <unk> ' shark submarine , he states that it " allows them to cross a boundary previously <unk> human beings and to penetrate into another universe , the one beneath the seas that holds secrets hitherto unknown . " Ultimately , he believes that by the end of the story , " the family structure is in place " , with <unk> representing a father figure with financial control , and Haddock and Tintin , who have become brothers through their joint adventure , adding that with the aid of Francis Haddock , " the ancestor " , they are given a home at <unk> Hall . 
 Literary critic Tom McCarthy highlighted what he perceived as scenes in Red <unk> 's Treasure which reflected common themes in The Adventures of Tintin . He pointed out that in being a stowaway aboard the ship , <unk> was one of many <unk> in the series , and that the treasure represented the theme of jewels and precious stones which also cropped up in The Broken <unk> , Tintin in the Congo , and The <unk> Emerald . He noted Tintin 's <unk> of the <unk> and stated this was one of a number of calculation mistakes that the character makes in the series . He suggested that a scene in which the shark submarine pushes between Haddock 's buttocks was a form of sexual <unk> referencing anal sex , highlighting similar <unk> in The Broken <unk> and The Crab with the Golden Claws . 
 In 1957 , the animation company <unk> Studios produced Hergé 's Adventures of Tintin , a series of daily five @-@ minute colour adaptations based upon Hergé 's original comics . Red <unk> 's Treasure was the fifth story to be adapted in the second series ( and the eighth to be adapted overall ) , being directed by Ray <unk> and written by the cartoonist Greg . In later years , Greg would become editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tintin magazine . 
 In 1991 , a collaboration between the French studio <unk> and the Canadian animation company <unk> adapted 21 of the stories into a series of episodes , each 42 minutes long . Red <unk> 's Treasure was the tenth episode of The Adventures of Tintin to be produced , although it ran half as long as most of the others . Directed by <unk> <unk> , the series has been praised for being " generally faithful " , with compositions having been actually directly taken from the panels in the original comic book . 
 The Adventures of Tintin : The Secret of the Unicorn , a motion capture feature film directed by Steven Spielberg and produced by Peter Jackson , was released in most of the world October – November 2011 , and in the US on 21 December 2011 . The film is based partly upon The Secret of the Unicorn and partly on both Red <unk> 's Treasure and The Crab with the Golden Claws . A video @-@ game tie @-@ in to the movie was released October 2011 . 
 " God Put a Smile upon Your Face " is a song by British alternative rock band Coldplay . It was written by all members of the band for their second studio album , A Rush of Blood to the Head ( 2002 ) . The song is built around prominent acoustic and electric guitar riffs with accompanying up @-@ tempo drumming . The song was released on 14 July 2003 as the fourth and final single from the album . 
 Regional singles were released for Canada , Europe , Australia , and an enhanced version for Taiwan . <unk> singles were released for the United Kingdom and United States . Since only <unk> copies were released , the single reached only number 100 in the UK Singles Chart . 
 Coldplay vocalist Chris Martin said , about the writing of the song , " That came out of playing live and wanting to have something with a bit more bounce . We were really getting into things like <unk> Harvey and <unk> – things with a bit more energy . " 
 When asked about the development of the song , during a track @-@ by @-@ track reveal , bassist Guy <unk> said : 
 When we came to record it in the studio we struggled because there was something just not quite right about it and I wasn 't happy about where we 'd left it and where we were happy to leave it and we couldn 't put our finger on what it was and so it was a really nice day one day , me and Chris were just trying , I was actually just trying to record bass at the time and me and Chris were just sitting down trying to <unk> it and work out what was wrong and so I started trying to just do a few different bass lines and stuff . Between the two of us we came up with just this kind of groove , which stays on the same note as opposed to change , it 's quite technical but it kind of added a bit of bounce to the song and it made it roll along in a much more fluid way . It was a bit mechanical before and it 's just interesting how something small like that can really change the whole vibe of a song . It was just nice because from there on it was one of our favourite tracks and it almost didn 't get on the record but it 's now one of our favourite tracks . 
 The song features an acoustic and electric guitar sound . The song starts with a <unk> acoustic ballad , the song then builds into a <unk> of an electric guitar and soaring with vocals . The song also includes an uptempo <unk> drumming rhythm . 
 The first line of the third verse allude to a definitive moment with the cryptic reference to God : " Now when you work it out , I 'm worse than you / Yeah , when you work it out I wanted to / Now , when you work out where to draw the line / Your guess is as good as mine . " Greg <unk> of the Chicago Tribune commented that the lyric " God gave you style and gave you grace , " Martin sings as if " <unk> the attributes he only wishes he had " . When the song is performed live , guitarist Jonny Buckland begins a long <unk> off guitar riff while Chris Martin plays an acoustic guitar . 
 Coldplay released " God Put a Smile upon Your Face " in the UK on 7 July 2003 . This was followed with releases in the US and Canada on 14 July 2003 . The song was later released on 21 July 2003 in Australia and Taiwan . When the song was released , it featured the B @-@ side " Murder " . The single cover features bassist Guy <unk> , art @-@ directed by <unk> <unk> . Regional singles were released for Canada , Europe , Australia , and an enhanced version for Taiwan . <unk> singles were released in the UK and US . 
 Critics were positive towards the song . In the Rolling Stone review of the album , critic Rob Sheffield wrote : " ' God Put a Smile Upon Your Face ' is the <unk> and best thing Coldplay have ever done . " Adrien Begrand of PopMatters wrote : " Buckland 's lead fills highlight the <unk> ' God Put a Smile on Your Face ' , as the song 's chorus reaches heights that rival those of their fellow countrymen <unk> . " Ted Kessler of NME wrote : " Over a pounding garage tattoo Martin poses a deep , mortality @-@ based teaser ( ' where do we go from here ? ' ) , asserts some self @-@ belief ( ' God gave me style , God gave me grace ' ) and then hits upon the bottom line as the song 's mood suddenly improves with another fat and glorious chorus : ' Yeah , when you work it out I 'm the same as you .... your guess is as good as mine . ' " 
 " God Put a Smile upon Your Face " was featured in the band 's live album , Live 2003 . The song is available on Guitar Hero III : Legends of Rock video game as a downloadable song . The game also includes other Coldplay songs such as " Yellow " and " <unk> Hill " . Plan B sampled the track on his 2007 <unk> <unk> it <unk> . The song was also covered by Mark <unk> on his album Version , which he performed live with <unk> at the 2008 <unk> Awards . 
 The music video , released in October 2003 , is shot in black @-@ and @-@ white and has a narrative theme . The video is directed by Jamie <unk> , who had previously directed the band 's third video for " The <unk> " .

 M @-@ 66 is a north – south state trunkline highway on the Lower Peninsula ( LP ) of the US state of Michigan . It runs from the Indiana state line in the south to <unk> in the north . M @-@ 66 is the only state highway to traverse almost the entire north – south distance of the LP . It starts as a continuation of State Road 9 ( SR 9 ) which provides access to the Indiana <unk> Road . The total length is 272 @.@ <unk> miles ( 439 @.@ 187 km ) , which includes 3 @.@ 374 miles ( 5 @.@ 430 km ) of freeway between Interstate 94 ( I @-@ 94 ) and downtown Battle Creek designated as I @-@ 194 . One section of the highway is an expressway , a type of divided limited access highway , while the section along I @-@ 194 is a full freeway , otherwise M @-@ 66 is a two @-@ lane rural highway . Two sections are listed on the National Highway System . 
 The first usage of the M @-@ 66 designation dates back to around July 1 , 1919 with the rest of the original state highway system . At the time , the highway only extended between Lowell and <unk> , a route now covered by M @-@ 91 . The highway has been lengthened in a series of extensions north and south starting in 1925 . A <unk> in 1944 – 45 removed M @-@ 66 from its original 1919 routing to replace another highway south of Six Lakes , the change that spawned M @-@ 91 . The last big extension in 1965 resulted in the modern trans @-@ <unk> highway route . The last modifications were shorter <unk> in the 1970s . 
 M @-@ 66 runs for 266 @.@ <unk> miles ( <unk> @.@ <unk> km ) as an almost entirely a north – south undivided surface highway in western Michigan from the Indiana state line north to Lake Michigan at <unk> . Most of the highway is two @-@ lane undivided rural highway . There is a section south of Battle Creek that is a four @-@ lane expressway . Running north into the <unk> City , M @-@ 66 is concurrent with I @-@ 194 , which is a full freeway . This section along I @-@ 194 is listed on the National Highway System ( NHS ) , a system of highways important to the nation 's economy , defense , and mobility . Another section of M @-@ 66 is included on the NHS where it is concurrent with either M @-@ 72 or U.S. Highway 131 ( US 131 ) in <unk> or Antrim counties . 
 M @-@ 66 is a four @-@ lane highway that connects with State Road 9 ( SR 9 ) at the Indiana state line in southern St. Joseph County . The highway runs north to <unk> through farm land where it turns east through town running concurrently with US 12 on Chicago Road . As it leaves <unk> to the north it crosses a branch of the Michigan Southern Railroad , and it becomes a two @-@ lane surface highway along <unk> Street . The highway runs near several small lakes and crosses the <unk> Creek before meeting M @-@ 86 . The two highways run north – south concurrently for about 1 @.@ 9 miles ( 3 @.@ 1 km ) along the <unk> – <unk> township line . Farther north , M @-@ 66 crosses the St. Joseph River and meets M @-@ 60 . M @-@ 60 / M @-@ 66 run together to the east , turning northeasterly in <unk> running parallel to <unk> Creek and crossing into the northwest corner of Branch County . M @-@ 60 and M @-@ 66 separate west of Union City , and M @-@ 66 turns north into <unk> County . 
 Running through woodland terrain in southern <unk> County , M @-@ 66 passes through Athens , along Graham Lake and continues to the outskirts of Battle Creek . The highway <unk> first to a four @-@ lane , limited access expressway south of the <unk> Square Mall before becoming a full freeway at the interchange with I @-@ 94 . It is at the transition to freeway that M @-@ 66 starts its concurrency with I @-@ 194 . I @-@ 194 / M @-@ 66 is known as the <unk> Truth Downtown Parkway , but the locals still use the former semi @-@ official nickname , " The <unk> " . The southern section of the freeway has the highest traffic levels along M @-@ 66 as measured by average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) in the survey conducted in 2009 . The Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) <unk> the AADT value as a tally of the average number of vehicles using a given stretch of roadway . I @-@ 194 / M @-@ 66 carried 25 @,@ 200 vehicles on the average day during the year ; 980 trucks were included in that traffic . The freeway continues 3 @.@ 374 miles ( 5 @.@ 430 km ) north into downtown Battle Creek along part of the Kalamazoo River and crossing a branch of the Canadian National Railway and Norfolk Southern Railway before ending at the at @-@ grade intersection with <unk> Avenue . I @-@ 194 ends , and M @-@ 66 continues northeast out of the <unk> City on Division Street and then northeast on Capital Avenue along the Battle Creek River . 
 M @-@ 66 continues northward through Barry County on Capital Avenue which becomes 9 Mile Road north of <unk> Road . The highway passes through Assyria before meeting M @-@ 79 , with which it has a short concurrency , in Nashville . On the north side of the village , M @-@ 66 crosses the <unk> River and continues north through mixed rural forest land and farm fields . Near Woodland , M @-@ 66 joins M @-@ 43 and the two run to the northeast and along the Barry – Eaton county line . M @-@ 43 / M @-@ 66 meets M @-@ 50 at a four @-@ way intersection southwest of Lake Odessa near <unk> , and M @-@ 43 turns east leaving M @-@ 66 in favor of a concurrency with M @-@ 50 . M @-@ 66 crosses a rail line of <unk> Transportation and the county line on State Road . It meets I @-@ 96 in a rural southern part of the <unk> County south of <unk> . On the south edge of town , the highway passes the county airport and curves to the northeast becoming Dexter Street . While entering downtown <unk> , the trunkline crosses the Grand River and the mainline of the Grand Rapids Eastern Railroad near the county <unk> . M @-@ 66 turns west along M @-@ 21 ( Lincoln Avenue ) for two blocks before turning back to the north along State Street . The trunkline runs through the northern part of the county and meets M @-@ 44 's eastern terminus near <unk> Lake . 
 The highway meets US 10 near <unk> after crossing the <unk> Marquette State Trail . M @-@ 66 crosses the <unk> River near a separate 9 Mile Road in <unk> County . It meets both M @-@ 115 and M @-@ 61 ( 16 Mile Road ) south of Marion . The highway continues north and crosses the Great Lakes Central Railroad for the first time in Marion , before entering <unk> County . The trunkline then turns westward on <unk> Corners Road toward <unk> through farm land . In town it runs along Maple Street and then runs north toward Lake City on Morey Road . South of the Lake City , M @-@ 55 runs concurrently with M @-@ 66 by <unk> Golf Course and into town along the eastern shore of Lake <unk> . North of town , M @-@ 55 splits off to the east on Houghton Lake Road , and M @-@ 66 continues north to an intersection with the eastern terminus of M @-@ 42 in a rural forest . M @-@ 66 leaves Morey Road and follows Pioneer Road to the county line . 
 As the highway crosses into <unk> County it crosses the <unk> River . M @-@ 66 runs through rolling hills in woodlands through the unincorporated farming community of <unk> north to an intersection with M @-@ 72 . The two highways travel west together over the Great Lakes Central Railroad before turning north and merging with US 131 on a route parallel to the rail line . US 131 / M @-@ 66 / M @-@ 72 follows and crosses a branch of the <unk> River along Cedar Street through downtown <unk> . North of the central business district , M @-@ 72 separates to the west and US 131 / M @-@ 66 crosses through the <unk> Marquette State Forest on the way to Antrim and <unk> in Antrim County . The highway follows Williams Street through the twin towns , meeting the southern terminus of M @-@ 88 and western terminus of C @-@ 38 at the intersection with State Street in <unk> . M @-@ 66 separates from US 131 and follows <unk> – East Jordan Road out of town . 
 The section of M @-@ 66 north of the US 131 split had the highway 's lowest AADT levels in the 2009 survey . MDOT reported that only 1 @,@ 500 vehicles use this stretch of road in 2009 . Of these vehicles , only were 140 trucks that used the segment of highway in 2009 . The highway meanders through more forest lands through the community of Green River to East Jordan . M @-@ 66 follows Lake Street and turns to follow the western shore of the South Arm of Lake <unk> . The roadway turns inland through <unk> before returning to the <unk> the rest of the way to <unk> . M @-@ 66 ends at an intersection with US 31 south of downtown next to Lake Michigan . 
 MDOT provides a number of different services to motorists traveling along the state trunkline highway system . Along M @-@ 66 , there are six different <unk> lots located near Nashville , Woodland , <unk> , Sheridan , <unk> and Marion . There are additional services provided to travelers in the form of roadside parks and rest areas . There are two roadside parks along the highway , one is between Woodland and <unk> , and the second is in Sheridan . The roadway also provides access to the <unk> State Recreation Area and a state harbor on Lake <unk> . 
 M @-@ 66 was first signed along a roadway by July 1 , 1919 between M @-@ 16 ( now M @-@ 21 ) at Lowell and M @-@ 46 near <unk> . The designation was extended in 1925 along M @-@ 46 to Six Lakes and then north to M @-@ 13 ( now US 131 ) in <unk> . A further extension north from <unk> in 1929 or 1930 along M @-@ 131 to <unk> , a short segment of M @-@ 88 and north to US 31 in <unk> . The southern end was extended to US 16 south of Lowell by 1931 . A section of the northern extension was marked on maps through 1933 as " under construction " . That section was cancelled in favor of another routing near <unk> . A short bypass of Six Lakes added about a mile to the length of the roadway in 1936 . The M @-@ 131 concurrency was switched to a US 131 concurrency when the latter was extended in 1939 . This concurrency was shortened just before World War II when the Michigan State Highway Department ( MSHD ) rerouted US 131 along a new road between South <unk> and <unk> . 
 The MSHD completed a major <unk> of M @-@ 66 around 1944 – 45 . The M @-@ 14 designation of the time was decommissioned and replaced with M @-@ 66 . Starting at Six Lakes , M @-@ 66 turned west along M @-@ 46 instead of east and then turned south through Stanton and <unk> ending north of Battle Creek . The highway between Lowell and <unk> was redesignated as M @-@ 91 . A minor realignment in late 1950 removed two 90 ° curves near the <unk> – <unk> county line and replaced them with a pair of sweeping curves . 
 The MSHD rerouted M @-@ 66 between Maple Grove and Nashville in mid @-@ 1953 . In the changes , M @-@ 79 was extended along the new route of M @-@ 66 and then over M @-@ <unk> to Hastings . M @-@ 66 was shifted off Assyria Road which was turned back to local control . Another realignment in 1954 shifted M @-@ 66 to the modern routing between the M @-@ 43 concurrency <unk> , removing M @-@ 43 / M @-@ 66 from a section of M @-@ 50 in the process . The final section gravel section of M @-@ 66 , approximately 11 miles ( 18 km ) in length , was paved near Nashville in 1957 . M @-@ 32 was extended along the <unk> section of M @-@ 66 in 1963 . 
 M @-@ 66 was extended <unk> from Assyria through Battle Creek to the Indiana state line replacing sections of M @-@ 78 in 1965 . M @-@ 66 turned south and west along M @-@ 60 and new highway to <unk> . The segment of former M @-@ 78 not used by M @-@ 66 was transferred to local control . The final section of M @-@ 78 's roadway given to M @-@ 66 extended it all the way to the state line , resulting in a north – south trans @-@ <unk> highway from Lake Michigan near <unk> to Indiana . M @-@ 66 is the only such highway to run the length of the Lower Peninsula . The extension allowed the Green Arrow Association to promote the whole length of the Green Arrow Route with a single highway number . The next year , M @-@ 66 was rerouted through Battle Creek to use the completed I @-@ 194 freeway . 
 A 90 ° turn in <unk> County was removed north of Lake City in 1972 . In late 1973 or early 1974 , M @-@ 66 and M @-@ 72 were shifted around the south side of <unk> . Later in 1974 , the M @-@ 32 concurrency was removed when M @-@ 32 was scaled back to its former terminus . A project in 1981 furthered the 1972 realignment in <unk> County . About 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) were shortened from the routing when the new alignment was built between <unk> and <unk> Road . 
 To capitalize on the opening of the Mackinac Bridge in 1957 , local leaders in Battle Creek wanted to promote M @-@ 66 as a route north from Indiana to the bridge . They named the highway the Green Arrow Route as part of this marketing strategy . The color was to evoke the forests in the area , and arrow was meant to play on several historical connections . One of these was the Pennsylvania Railroad 's Northern Arrow passenger train that once operated in the area . The official explanation was to tie into the history of Native Americans in the area , but the route was also " straight as an arrow " . The <unk> also promoted the highway as a direct and scenic route to vacation country in the northern Lower Peninsula , avoiding most of the larger cities in the area . M @-@ 66 was given the Green Arrow Route name in Public Act 170 of 1959 between the Indiana state line and <unk> . Despite these efforts , M @-@ 66 failed to attract much traffic . When the Michigan Legislature <unk> the memorial highway names in Public Act 142 of 2001 , the Green Arrow Route was truncated to the northern border of <unk> County , a change confirmed by Public Act 138 of 2004 . 
 Born Isabella <unk> in 1797 , <unk> Truth settled in the Battle Creek area in the 1840s . She travelled through the Midwest and New England speaking against slavery and for women 's rights . She lived in the area until her death in 1883 . Her connection to the state of Michigan was honored by the state American Revolution <unk> Commission in 1976 which urged the Michigan Legislature to name a highway in her honor . Public Act 93 of 1976 named all of M @-@ 66 in <unk> County , including the segment that runs concurrently with I @-@ 194 , as the <unk> Truth Memorial Highway . The highway was dedicated to her on May 21 , 1976 . 
 The <unk> City Development Corporation ( <unk> ) asked the Legislature to amend the memorial designation in 1993 . They felt that I @-@ 194 / M @-@ 66 was better known to locals as The <unk> , and they wished to restore emphasis to Truth . They asked for the " <unk> Truth Downtown Parkway " name to be applied to " M @-@ 66 between Interstate 94 and <unk> " . The Legislature passed Public Act 208 of 1993 to affect the change , restoring " the link between <unk> Truth and the City of Battle Creek , which was once the center of abolitionist sentiment in the state . " 
 The 15th <unk> Brigade was a <unk> brigade of the United States Army based at Fort <unk> , Texas . It provided logistics support to other units of the United States Army , and was subordinate to the 13th <unk> Command ( Expeditionary ) . It previously had provided support to the 1st Cavalry Division , but now did so for the 1st Armored Division until 12 May 2015 when the 15th <unk> Brigade became part of the 1st Armored Division and was renamed 1st Armored Division <unk> Brigade . 
 The brigade 's lineage dates back to 1919 , and it had a long and decorated history when designated as the supply command of the 1st Cavalry Division . Having seen service in every major conflict of the 20th century in support of its parent division , the unit was not designated as the 15th <unk> Brigade permanently until 2005 . In February 2008 , the brigade was reassigned to the 13th <unk> Command , ending almost a century of association with the 1st Cavalry Division . 
 The 15th <unk> Brigade 's extensive lineage also carries many honors for the unit . What is now the 15th <unk> Brigade , and its previous <unk> , have earned 17 campaign streamers , as well as numerous awards , mostly for service during the Vietnam War . These decorations include the Presidential Unit <unk> , the <unk> Unit Award , and five <unk> Unit <unk> . 
 The 15th <unk> Brigade was permanently attached to the 1st Cavalry Division , though it could operate independently when needed . Currently , it falls under the organization of the 1st Armored Division , having relocated as part of the Base <unk> and <unk> 2005 . This assignment allows the unit maximum flexibility when deployed , as it can provide any support function needed , without being permanently attached to any particular unit or area of operations . 
 The 15th <unk> Brigade was originally constituted on 4 May 1966 in the Regular Army as a Headquarters and Headquarters Company . It was first activated on 1 July 1966 . 
 On 20 October 1967 , the Brigade was inactivated after providing support to units in Vietnam , only to be reactivated on 21 September 1968 at Fort Lewis , Washington . The Brigade later inactivated at Fort Lewis on 21 March 1973 having received campaign credits for its support for <unk> Operations ( Phase II and III ) in Vietnam . 
 As mentioned above , the 15th <unk> Brigade replaced the “ Division Support Command ” of the 1st Cavalry Division . The history of the organization can be traced back to 1919 when one of its present units , the 15th Forward Support Battalion , existed as the <unk> Motor Transport Company . The Division Support Command ( <unk> ) thus <unk> the 1st Cavalry Division itself , which was not established until 1921 . 
 In the years before World War II , most of the units of the 1st Cavalry Division that were not assigned to larger unit commands were under the control of the Headquarters , Division Special Troops of the division ; an independent unit for various supporting units for a division . These included the service and support elements of the division . After World War II , however , the Special Troops Headquarters was reorganized into Headquarters , Division Trains . This designation immediately predates the " Division Support Command " ( <unk> ) designation . The division trains were activated 1 November 1957 in Korea . Although a new organization , 1st Cavalry Division 's Division Trains employed concepts and tactics similar to those of U.S. armored division trains that were originated in World War I. 
 On 1 September 1963 , Headquarters , Division Trains was reorganized under the " <unk> " ( <unk> of the Army Divisions ) plan and redesignated as Headquarters , Headquarters Company and Band , 1st Cavalry Division , 1st Cavalry Division Support Command . <unk> the division to Vietnam in August 1965 , the Support Command participated in all of the same campaigns that the division did , providing logistics support for the 1st Cavalry Division throughout the entire conflict . 
 The unit 's first major operation was the <unk> Campaign . During this action , the command supported the division during 35 days of continuous <unk> operations . The opening battle of the campaign , the Battle of <unk> <unk> Valley , was described in the book We Were Soldiers Once ... And Young which was also the basis of the subsequent <unk> Gibson film We Were Soldiers . 
 For most of 1967 and early 1968 , the formation supported the 1st Cavalry Division through Operation <unk> . This was a large scale search of areas under the jurisdiction of the US II Corps which , according to the US Army , saw 5 @,@ 400 enemy killed and 2 @,@ 000 captured . The division re @-@ deployed to Camp Evans , north of <unk> in the I Corps Tactical Zone , during the 1968 <unk> Offensive It was involved in <unk> <unk> Tri and <unk> regions . After intense fighting in <unk> , the division then moved to relieve US Marine Corps units besieged at the Khe Sanh combat base in Operation <unk> through March 1968 . The 1st Cavalry Division next conducted major clearing operations in the <unk> Valley from mid @-@ April through mid @-@ May 1968 . From May until September 1968 , the division participated in local pacification missions , as well as Medical outreach programs intended to offer medical support to the Vietnamese local population . During this time , the division and support command were assigned to I Corps . 
 In the autumn of 1968 , the 1st Cavalry Division relocated south to the III Corps Tactical Zone northwest of Saigon , adjacent to a Cambodian region commonly referred to as the " <unk> Beak " , due to its shape . In May 1970 , the division was among U.S. units participating in the Cambodian <unk> , withdrawing from Cambodia on 29 June . The division thereafter took a defensive posture while the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Vietnam continued . The bulk of the division was withdrawn on 29 April 1971 . 
 The Division Support Command received all of the same honors as the division headquarters throughout the conflict . These awards included the Presidential Unit <unk> for the actions in <unk> Province and the <unk> Unit Award for action in the “ <unk> Beak ” area of Cambodia ( referred to as the " Fish Hook " area in the unit 's award <unk> ) . In addition , Support Command received three <unk> Unit <unk> and four Republic of Vietnam Cross of <unk> awards throughout the deployments . 
 On 15 May 1971 , the <unk> was reorganized and designated as Headquarters and Headquarters Company , 1st Cavalry Division Support Command . Most major subordinate units of the <unk> had returned from Vietnam in 1971 and were stationed at Fort Hood . By the end of June 1971 , the <unk> was a large command composed of <unk> , Support Command , 15th <unk> General Company / Band , 15th Medical Battalion , 15th Supply and Transport Battalion , 27th Maintenance Battalion , 8th Engineer Battalion , <unk> Composite Support Battalion , 15th Finance Company ( the latter two units had been transferred from the 1st Armored Division ) , and the 15th Data <unk> Unit . 
 During the early 1980s , the <unk> consisted of a Headquarters Company , a Division <unk> Management Center , a Division Data Center , the 15th Medical Battalion , 15th <unk> General Battalion , 15th Finance Company , 15th Supply and Transport Battalion , 27th Maintenance Battalion and the 68th Chemical Company . In October 1984 , the 1st and 2nd Forward Support Battalions were activated from elements of the three functional battalions attached to the unit . The following year saw the Army of Excellence <unk> ( <unk> ) transform the remaining elements of the three functional battalions ( maintenance , medical , and supply and transport ) into the 4th Main Support Battalion . The <unk> <unk> also added the <unk> Transportation Company ( Aircraft Maintenance ) to the Division Support Command . The forward and main support battalions , along with the Aviation Maintenance Company , were redesignated in 1987 , becoming the 15th and <unk> Forward Support Battalions , 27th Main Support Battalion , and <unk> Transportation Company ( Aviation Maintenance ) . 
 On 28 September 1990 , the Division Support Command deployed to the Middle East in support of Operation Desert Shield . In January 1991 , Division Support Command provided support to the 1st Cavalry Division throughout Operation Desert Storm , leading to a quick liberation of Kuwait . On 16 December 1991 , the <unk> Forward Support Battalion was activated at Fort Hood bringing the number of active duty forward support battalions to three . On 8 July 1996 , the <unk> Support Battalion ( Aviation ) was <unk> organized . The battalion was formally activated on 17 September 1996 . 
 On 6 July 2005 , the Division Support Command ( <unk> ) of the 1st Cavalry Division was inactivated and redesignated the 15th <unk> Brigade . <unk> ’ s previously subordinate Forward Support Battalions were redesignated Brigade Support Battalions and task organized under their supported maneuver brigade . 
 The 15th <unk> Brigade was the first element of the 1st Cavalry Division to return to Iraq and assumed control for logistics in the Baghdad area of operations in July 2006 . The Brigade provided command and control for numerous units not normally associated with the 1st Cavalry Division . It had sustained several casualties during its tour in the country , including a mortar attack that killed two soldiers and injured five more in October 2007 . <unk> the unit completed during its 2006 – 2007 tour in Iraq included construction and maintenance of <unk> facilities , and maintaining vehicles , including adding additional armor to <unk> vehicles for other US units operating in the country . 
 The Brigade changed its higher command for the first time in its history on 15 February 2008 . It was reassigned from the 1st Cavalry Division to the 13th <unk> Command ( Expeditionary ) , holding a mock cavalry charge to celebrate the occasion . This would also mark the first time that the brigade served independently from the 1st Cavalry Division . Since returning from Iraq , the brigade has undertaken a number of duties around Fort Hood . These activities include testing new systems for use during deployments , <unk> infrastructure around the fort , and training on personal safety . 
 The <unk> Brigade and its soldiers have been the subject of numerous army publications during its tours in Iraq , most of which having to do with the culture and lifestyle of soldiers serving the unit . Among these have been feature stories by the Multi @-@ National Force : Iraq public affairs office , on married soldiers who deploy together . The Army <unk> , an Army publication for soldiers serving in support units , published a feature story on the stories of soldiers serving in Iraq for their September – October 2007 issue . This story was intended to display the versatility of <unk> brigades overall . Another story was written for <unk> , the press service for the United States Armed Forces in March 2007 about soldiers of the brigade and how they react to the desert climate of the country , having to cope with <unk> and other issues . 
 It is one of very few manuscripts of <unk> Gothic Bible . The manuscript is fragmentary . The four leaves of the <unk> were used as raw material for the production of another manuscript – <unk> <unk> 64 <unk> . It is a <unk> , and its text was reconstructed several times . Franz Anton <unk> was the first to examine it and <unk> its text . 
 The <unk> has survived to the present day in a very fragmentary condition . It contains only the text of the <unk> to the Romans 11 @-@ 15 on four <unk> leaves ( size 26 @.@ 5 cm by 21 @.@ 5 cm ) . The text is written in two parallel columns , 27 lines per column . The left column is in Gothic , the right in Latin . 
 The text of the <unk> is not divided into chapters . The nomina <unk> are used both in Gothic and Latin texts ( <unk> and <unk> for " <unk> " and " <unk> " ) . All the abbreviations are marked with the <unk> bar . Its text has some value in Romans 14 : 14 for <unk> Criticism . 
 The manuscript is dated <unk> to the 6th century or 7th century . According to <unk> it was written in the 6th century . Probably it was written in Italy . Nothing is known about its early history . In the 12th or 13th century four of its leaves were used as material for another book and they were <unk> by Latin text . Its later story is linked with the <unk> <unk> A and B. 
 <unk> the manuscript was held in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and Prague . The Duke of Brunswick bought it in 1689 . 
 <unk> made many errors , especially in Latin text , he also did not <unk> every word and left several <unk> in the reconstructed text ( e.g. Romans 11 : 35 ; 12 : 2 ; 15 : 8 ) . <unk> made a new and more accurate <unk> for the Latin text and edited in 1855 . <unk> used abbreviations for the nomina <unk> , he did not leave any <unk> . The new <unk> of the Gothic text was given by Carla <unk> in 1999 . 
 <unk> , the mountain is a <unk> @-@ like <unk> , that is to say , the remains of a plateau that has been otherwise eroded to leave only a single pillar of rock - weaker or fractured rocks ( the so @-@ called <unk> fault ) between the current summit and the <unk> high plateau were eroded over time by over 400 metres , leaving the peak standing on its own . This has resulted in several unique features of Mont <unk> , including the cliffs , which are almost identical to those on the eastern edge of the <unk> Plateau such as those on the edge of the Grand <unk> , which is the highest point of the range . Another feature resulting from this is the presence of meadows on the summit plateau , which are similar to those to the west on the rest of the <unk> plateau . 
 Mont <unk> is a limestone <unk> , previously connected to the main body of the high plateau of the <unk> <unk> . The summit is made up of lower Barremian strata , deposited during the Cretaceous period . This is the same as the plateau to the west , but not as the immediate environs : the lower slopes are composed of older <unk> strata . As easily observed , the <unk> planes are all roughly level , although there is some inclination down to the north @-@ east . 
 German submarine U @-@ 111 was a Type <unk> U @-@ boat of Nazi Germany 's Kriegsmarine during World War II . 
 She had a short career , sinking four enemy vessels and damaging one other . These victories took place over a period of two war patrols . During her first sortie , the boat sank two enemy vessels and damaged a further one . On her second patrol , U @-@ 111 sank two more enemy ships before she herself was sunk on 4 October 1941 southwest of <unk> , by depth charges from a British warship . Out of a crew of 52 officers and men , eight died in the attack ; 44 survived . 
 U @-@ 111 was ordered to be built by the Kriegsmarine on 8 August 1939 ( as part of Plan Z and in violation of the Treaty of Versailles ) . Her keel was laid down on 20 February 1940 by <unk> AG <unk> in <unk> as yard number <unk> . Following about seven months of construction , she was launched on 15 September and commissioned on 19 December under the command of <unk> Wilhelm <unk> . 
 German Type <unk> submarines were slightly larger than the original German Type IX submarines , later designated <unk> . U @-@ 111 had a displacement of 1 @,@ <unk> tonnes ( 1 @,@ <unk> long tons ) when at the surface and 1 @,@ 178 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 159 long tons ) while submerged . The U @-@ boat had a total length of 76 @.@ 50 m ( 251 ft ) , a pressure hull length of 58 @.@ 75 m ( 192 ft 9 in ) , a beam of 6 @.@ 76 m ( 22 ft 2 in ) , a height of 9 @.@ 60 m ( 31 ft 6 in ) , and a draught of 4 @.@ 70 m ( 15 ft 5 in ) . The submarine was powered by two <unk> M 9 V 40 / 46 <unk> four @-@ stroke , nine @-@ cylinder diesel engines producing a total of 4 @,@ 400 metric horsepower ( 3 @,@ 240 kW ; 4 @,@ 340 shp ) for use while surfaced , two <unk> @-@ <unk> 2 <unk> 345 / 34 double @-@ acting electric <unk> producing a total of 1 @,@ 000 metric horsepower ( 740 kW ; 990 shp ) for use while submerged . She had two shafts and two 1 @.@ 92 m ( 6 ft ) propellers . The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to 230 metres ( 750 ft ) . 
 The submarine had a maximum surface speed of 18 @.@ 2 knots ( 33 @.@ 7 km / h ; 20 @.@ 9 mph ) and a maximum submerged speed of 7 @.@ 3 knots ( 13 @.@ 5 km / h ; 8 @.@ 4 mph ) . When submerged , the boat could operate for 64 nautical miles ( 119 km ; 74 mi ) at 4 knots ( 7 @.@ 4 km / h ; 4 @.@ 6 mph ) ; when surfaced , she could travel 12 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 22 @,@ 000 km ; 14 @,@ 000 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . U @-@ 111 was fitted with six 53 @.@ 3 cm ( 21 in ) torpedo tubes ( four fitted at the bow and two at the stern ) , 22 torpedoes , one 10 @.@ 5 cm ( 4 @.@ 13 in ) SK C / 32 naval gun , 180 rounds , and a 3 @.@ 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) as well as a 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) anti @-@ aircraft gun . The boat had a complement of forty @-@ eight . 
 U @-@ 111 went to sea on a war patrol for the first time on 5 May 1941 . For a period of 64 days , she roamed the North Sea and eventually the North Atlantic as far west as Nova Scotia in search of any Allied convoys heading to Great Britain . During that time she encountered three enemy vessels . The first confrontation took place on the 13th , just eight days after leaving port , when she came across the British merchant vessel SS <unk> and sank her just south of Iceland . On 20 May , the submarine came across the <unk> San Felix and fired a torpedo at her , causing damage to her hull but failing to sink her . Two days later , U @-@ 111 sank the second and last enemy vessel of her patrol , the <unk> , south of Greenland . After these victories , the boat returned to port . However , instead of returning to Wilhelmshaven , she entered the port of <unk> in occupied France on 7 July . 
 U @-@ 111 left <unk> on 14 August 1941 and travelled south off the west coast of Africa and into the South Atlantic . She then turned west towards the eastern coast of Brazil . It was in these waters that the boat sank her last two enemy merchant ships . The first was the Dutch Motor merchant vessel <unk> . She was torpedoed on 10 September just north of <unk> in Brazil . All of her crew survived the attack and boarded life boats . They were questioned by the crew of the U @-@ boat , given food and released . <unk> 's crew were later safely picked up by a Spanish merchant vessel . Ten days later , U @-@ 111 sank her fourth and last enemy vessel , the British motor merchant ship <unk> Prince also off Brazil . On 28 September she was involved in an action in <unk> Bay , in the Cape Verde islands ; having been ordered to rendezvous there with two other U @-@ boats , U @-@ 67 and U @-@ 68 . She was struck by the British submarine HMS Clyde which had accidentally <unk> onto her after unsuccessfully attacking U – 67 . U @-@ 111 was so badly damaged she was left unable to dive , and was obliged to head for home . On 4 October 1941 , she was hunted down and sunk by depth charges from the British anti @-@ submarine trawler HMS Lady Shirley southwest of <unk> . Of a crew of 52 men , eight died ; including <unk> Smith 44 survived . They were subsequently interrogated ; it was the first time prisoners of war were captured from a U @-@ boat operating in the South Atlantic . 
 <unk> was bred by Sir <unk> Poole , a <unk> whose family seat was in Poole , Cheshire . Sir <unk> leased an extensive estate in Lewes that was built on land once owned by the Grey Friars and was called " The <unk> . " <unk> was <unk> in 1790 at Poole 's stable at The <unk> . 
 The colt was named " <unk> " to distinguish him from Poole 's other colt sired by <unk> @-@ 8 @-@ Os out of the mare <unk> , which was subsequently named " <unk> . " <unk> and <unk> were two types of potatoes available at the time and are a play on the name of the <unk> ' sire <unk> @-@ 8 @-@ Os , which is itself a pun on the name " <unk> . " A variant spelling , " <unk> , " is mentioned in some publications . 
 <unk> 's sire , <unk> @-@ 8 @-@ Os , was a successful sire of <unk> that had won 34 races during his seven @-@ year racing career . In addition to <unk> , <unk> @-@ 8 @-@ Os produced the mare <unk> ( the dam of Partisan ) and the colt <unk> . <unk> was <unk> @-@ 8 @-@ Os most successful son in the breeding shed , with <unk> 's sons carrying on the direct @-@ male line well into the 20th century . 
 At Lewes on 1 August , <unk> won an 80 @-@ <unk> <unk> race against Lord <unk> 's colt Mercury while carrying seven pounds more than the other horses in the race as a handicap for his win in the Derby . At Abingdon on 11 September , <unk> won a two @-@ mile 40 @-@ <unk> <unk> race against the colt <unk> . 
 At Oxford on 18 August , <unk> was second in a 100 @-@ <unk> cup race to Mr. Durand 's filly <unk> . At Lewes on 6 August , <unk> was third in the four @-@ mile Ladies ' Plate to the colt Guildford and Lord <unk> 's horse <unk> . On 19 September at Salisbury , <unk> won two <unk> to win the 100 @-@ <unk> His Majesty 's Plate against the five @-@ year @-@ old horse <unk> . 
 On 18 July at Oxford in the running for the Gold Cup , <unk> did not place and was noted to have " broke down " during the running . This was his last appearance on the turf and he was retired to <unk> the following season in 1798 . 
 <unk> died on 18 April 1818 at the advanced age ( for a Thoroughbred ) of 28 , having gone completely blind a few years before his death . He was buried at Newmarket , close to All Saints Church . 
 Pope ( also called <unk> Pope and Lord <unk> 's <unk> ) was <unk> in 1806 out of the mare <unk> by <unk> . Pope won the 1809 Derby in a close finish from the colt <unk> and won seven races in his career on the turf . He was later exported to Ireland and was a leading sire nine times . 
 <unk> was <unk> in 1807 out of the mare Penelope , who was a daughter of <unk> . He raced for six years and won the Derby in 1810 . He later sired two Derby winners , <unk> @-@ dog and <unk> and Caroline , winner of the Oaks . He might have been the sire of Derby winner Moses , but Moses ' parentage is uncertain due to his dam being covered by two stallions . 
 <unk> was full @-@ brother to <unk> and <unk> and was <unk> in 1809 . He won 12 races in his turf career and was a successful sire , especially of <unk> , for the <unk> Hall <unk> , producing winners of the Epsom Oaks , 1 @,@ 000 Guineas and St. <unk> Stakes . 
 <unk> was <unk> in 1811 from the mare <unk> by <unk> . <unk> won the Derby in 1814 and was a marginally successful sire , producing the third dam of <unk> . 
 <unk> was <unk> in 1812 and was a full @-@ brother to <unk> and <unk> . <unk> won the Derby in 1815 and 11 other races in his career . He sired Economist ( the <unk> of King Tom ) and the filly <unk> ( the dam of <unk> ) . 
 Web was <unk> in 1808 out of Penelope and was the <unk> of the influential stallion <unk> through her daughter <unk> . 
 Music was a full @-@ sister to <unk> out of the mare <unk> and was <unk> in 1810 . She won the Oaks in 1813 and was second in the 2 @,@ 000 Guineas Stakes , but did not produce any offspring of note . 
 <unk> was a full @-@ sister of Music and was <unk> in 1812 . She won the 1815 Oaks , July Stakes and several <unk> and produced several winners at <unk> , but her line did not endure . 
 <unk> was <unk> in 1815 out of the Oaks winner <unk> . She won the 1818 Epsom Oaks and 1 @,@ 000 Guineas Stakes but was an unsuccessful broodmare . 
 The Battle of Antioch ( 8 June 218 ) was fought between the Roman armies of the Emperor <unk> and his contender <unk> , whose troops were commanded by General <unk> . <unk> ' victory over <unk> led to the downfall of the emperor and his replacement by <unk> . After a short reign of four years , <unk> was also killed , after which a short period of stability followed . 
 The battle itself is not <unk> notable , and even the ancient scholars , <unk> and <unk> , only briefly consider the battle itself . However , it is historically notable as the ultimate action in a series of events that led the Army to select the emperor over the objections of the Senate . This further eroded one of the few official powers remaining in the Senate . 
 In the immediate aftermath of <unk> 's death , <unk> was selected to serve as emperor , but he declined the position due to his old age . The army then chose <unk> ; they had no feelings of ' love or esteem ' towards him , but there was no one else competing for the position . The army proclaimed <unk> as emperor three days after the death of <unk> , and named him Augustus . 
 The results were applauded by the Senate at first , who were glad to be rid of the former emperor . But tradition held that the emperor could only be selected from among the Senate , causing some concern . <unk> was a member of the <unk> class , the lower of the two aristocratic classes , which led to further concern . This led the Senate to severely <unk> his every action . The Senate , however , was powerless to do anything about it , the military was at the time so concentrated at Edessa that there was no force anywhere else in the Empire that could contest the action . 
 With the peace treaty concluded , <unk> took measures to control the <unk> of Rome , <unk> the fiscal policies of Septimius <unk> . This included a reduction in pay and benefits for Legionnaires , which was not popular with the Army who had placed him in command . These policies would only apply to new recruits , but the enlisted soldiers saw this as setting precedent for further changes to the fiscal policies brought in by <unk> . The <unk> behaviour of new recruits , who entered service committing to greater labour for less payment , only furthered discontent among the soldiers . <unk> suggests that from here only a small spark would be required to ignite a rebellion . 
 Following the death of <unk> , <unk> allowed <unk> 's mother , Julia <unk> , and his aunt Julia <unk> , to settle in their home town of Emesa . Julia <unk> , who was at Antioch at the time of <unk> 's death , attempted suicide and eventually succeeded by <unk> herself . Julia <unk> , however , returned to Emesa with her finances intact . 
 <unk> might have been able to stop the rebellion in this early stage , but could not decide on a course of action and remained at Antioch . 
 Now that <unk> had the support of an entire legion , other <unk> , prompted by discontent over pay , moved to join <unk> ' ranks as well . In response , <unk> sent a cavalry force led under the command of <unk> <unk> to regain control of the rebels . Instead , the cavalry killed <unk> and joined <unk> . 
 <unk> ' and <unk> ' troops met somewhere near the border of Syria <unk> and Syria Phoenice , <unk> ' efforts here , however , were in vain and the whole legion defected to the <unk> , forcing him to retire to Antioch . This allowed <unk> to take the offensive and march on Antioch . 
 The battle took place on 8 June 218 at a <unk> outside of a village , believed to be <unk> , approximately twenty @-@ four miles or so by road between Antioch and <unk> . <unk> challenges this assertion , suggesting that the battle took place closer to the border at Syria <unk> and Syria Phoenice , possibly near Emesa . Other sources either agree with <unk> that the battle took place near Antioch , with one source , <unk> , suggesting that both battles occurred separately or make no claim as to where the battle occurred . 
 In the interim period between the battle and the capture of <unk> , <unk> declared himself emperor with the support of the military , though he would not return to Rome for several months . This news , upon reaching Rome , was met with dismay by both the Senate and the Roman people , though both submitted through necessity . <unk> ' reputation would not improve during his reign ; his worship of <unk> and the <unk> performance of religious rituals would generate anger among the Romans . In an attempt to prevent disaster , his cousin would be elevated to the position of <unk> , co @-@ ruler . This <unk> the Romans for a time , however envy caused further problems culminating in the death of <unk> at the hands of the <unk> Guard . This was followed by a short period of stability for Rome . 
 Days before the wedding , <unk> is playing his flute when he is approached by a singer known as Miss <unk> , who asks him to join her troupe on an international tour . <unk> refuses , even after <unk> hires him to drive her around the city in an attempt to convince him . After dropping <unk> off , <unk> is approached by a man who asks him to deliver a package ; however , before he can deliver the package <unk> is arrested and charged with smuggling opium . 
 At the time there was a growing movement to attract native intelligentsia , educated at schools run by the Dutch colonial government , and convince them to view domestic films , which were generally considered to be of much lower quality than imported Hollywood productions . This was blamed , in part , on the dominance of theatrically trained actors and crew . As such , <unk> invited <unk> , at the time a medical doctor and a prominent member of the nationalist movement , to join the cast . Although some nationalists considered <unk> 's involvement in <unk> <unk> as <unk> the independence movement , <unk> considered it necessary : he believed audiences needed to have higher opinions of domestic film productions . 
 <unk> <unk> was premiered on 29 April 1941 at Orion Theatre in Batavia ; the crowds were mostly natives and ethnic Chinese . Rated for all ages , advertising for the film emphasised <unk> 's education and <unk> 's upper @-@ class background . It was also advertised as breaking away from the conventional standards of stage theatre , such as music , which were <unk> in the contemporary film industry . By August 1941 it was screened in Singapore , then part of the Straits <unk> , and billed as a " modern Malay drama " . A <unk> was published later in 1941 by the Yogyakarta @-@ based <unk> @-@ <unk> . 
 The film was a commercial success , though reviews were mixed . An anonymous review for the <unk> <unk> found the film " fascinating " , with good acting , though another review for the same paper found that , though the film was better than contemporary works such as <unk> and <unk> Ka <unk> , its claim to abandon stage standards was to be taken " with a pinch of salt " . A review from the <unk> @-@ based <unk> <unk> found the film full of drama , describing it as " Western motifs , played in the native environment , with a specifically <unk> situation " . 
 London Country North East was a bus operator in South East England and London . It was formed from the split of London Country Bus Services in 1986 and operated a fleet of around 350 buses from six <unk> , with its headquarters located in Hatfield . 
 The company was the last subsidiary of National Bus Company to be <unk> , being sold to the <unk> Group on 22 April 1988 . Later in the same year it was split into County Bus & Coach and Sovereign Bus & Coach . 
 In the run @-@ up to <unk> , London Country Bus Services ( <unk> ) was broken into four smaller companies on 7 September 1986 . Three hundred and fifty buses , the <unk> at Hatfield , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , St Albans and the isolated base at Grays formed the new London Country North East ( <unk> ) company . 
 Early difficulties with staff conditions and wages , which the company was attempting to <unk> from the complex contracts arranged by <unk> , led to strike action by staff in February 1988 . Performance levels on contracted routes were already below those expected by the local councils who had awarded <unk> the contracts , and by London Regional Transport . Following the strike three of the company 's London contracts ( routes <unk> , 298 and <unk> ) were terminated and awarded to <unk> . 
 On 22 April 1988 , London Country North East was sold by the National Bus Company , the last of 72 <unk> to be <unk> . The buyer was Alan <unk> 's <unk> Group , which had been formed by the management buyout of West Yorkshire Road Car Company . As part of the sale <unk> 's property was bought by <unk> Holdings and leased back to the company ; some was sold for redevelopment , while the remainder was later sold back to <unk> . <unk> Holdings later went out of business having changed their name to Pavilion <unk> . 
 A month later <unk> was banned from registering new services for six months by the Traffic Commissioner for failing to operate service in accordance with <unk> made . Following poor financial results , <unk> decided to split the company in two . 
 In 20 months of existence London Country North East had lost £ 5 @.@ 5 million , on a turnover of £ 14 million . Two operating <unk> were created to help improve the situation , under the control of a single holding company , initially called the London Country Travel Group and later renamed to South of England Travel Group . Its chief executive , Bob <unk> , had previously been West Yorkshire Road Car Company 's traffic manager . A third company , Cambridge based Premier Travel Services , was added to the group in 1989 but was sold to <unk> in 1991 . Both <unk> continued to be owned by <unk> until 1991 , when they were sold to new owners . 
 <unk> group was wound up in 1991 , and the company 's director Bob <unk> bought County Bus & Coach through a new holding company , <unk> Travel Group . County Bus & Coach was relaunched with three new local identities : Grays garage became <unk> , <unk> became <unk> , and <unk> became Lea Valley . One small operator , <unk> Coaches of Upper Edmonton , was acquired a few months after and merged with County Bus & Coach . 
 The company was one of the beneficiaries of the collapse of London Forest , gaining three routes in <unk> . The services of Golden Boy were also taken over , in September 1992 , although this deal involved no vehicles and no garage . In July 1993 , <unk> Travel purchased 41 @-@ vehicle independent <unk> <unk> , based in Chadderton near Oldham . Other changes made in 1993 included the opening of a new garage in Grays to replace the previous building , and a totally new garage at Ware which replaced that at <unk> . Two more operators were taken over in 1994 , namely coach operators Airport Coaches of <unk> Airport and <unk> <unk> of Bishops Stortford . 
 However , on 7 October 1994 County Bus & Coach was sold to West Midlands Travel , who had also acquired the former London <unk> subsidiary <unk> . In November 1994 County Bus & Coach became only the tenth operator in the UK to introduce low @-@ floor vehicles into service , when four Dennis Lance <unk> with Wright <unk> <unk> were introduced to route 502 <unk> to <unk> . West Midlands Travel was taken over by National Express in 1995 , and the new owners decided not to keep their London companies . <unk> was the first to be sold , to London United in September 1995 . One year later , County Bus & Coach was sold to the rapidly expanding <unk> Group . 
 After also taking over British Bus on 1 August 1996 , who owned most of the other former London Country Bus Services company , in November 1997 the <unk> Group was rebranded as <unk> . 
 County Bus & Coach 's garage at Grays was transferred to <unk> Southend in 2000 , with that company becoming part of the <unk> Southern Counties operation in 2002 . The rest of County Bus & Coach 's routes , <unk> and vehicles became <unk> East <unk> & Essex . This was later combined with the former Luton & District and London Country North West operations to form <unk> <unk> & Essex , in which form County Bus & Coach continues to trade . 
 Sovereign Bus & Coach took over three former London Country North East depots in the 1989 split , namely Hatfield , <unk> and St Albans . These were quickly joined by the operations and <unk> depot of Jubilee Coaches , an independent which had previously taken several contracted routes from <unk> , but found it had bid too low for the routes and could no longer fulfil its operations . Hatfield garage was closed in 1989 , and a new site established at <unk> Garden City . Another operator , competitor <unk> Hatfield Line , was taken over in January 1990 and retained as a separate subsidiary for several years . Most of Sovereign 's <unk> operation was sold to Luton & District ( successors to London Country North West ) in 1990 . In 1991 the owning <unk> Group was wound up . Two directors formed the <unk> Group , and purchased Sovereign Bus & Coach and most of <unk> Group 's other operations . At the time Sovereign operated 76 vehicles . 
 Some expansion followed . In October 1991 a new <unk> , Sovereign <unk> ( <unk> ) , was formed to operate a number of London Regional Transport contracts won by the company . In August 1994 , the company 's position in London strengthened with the acquisition of the 43 @-@ vehicle <unk> Travel Services , which brought <unk> route 13 run with <unk> <unk> , under Sovereign operation . <unk> was renamed Sovereign London and merged with the <unk> operation . 
 The company 's fleet and operations remained largely static until 3 November 2002 , when <unk> sold Sovereign London to <unk> . 
 Sovereign contracted further in 2002 with the sale of the St Albans operation to <unk> . <unk> sold the depot to Uno in March 2008 . 
 By 2002 , Sovereign 's fleet amounted to just 45 vehicles . <unk> depot was closed and a smaller garage in the same town acquired , with <unk> <unk> & Essex taking over the old site . Finally , in January 2005 , the remainder of Sovereign was sold to <unk> <unk> & Essex . Having previously acquired the successors to the former London Country North West , London Country South West and London Country South East companies as well as County Bus & Coach , <unk> now owned all of the former London Country Bus Services apart from the St Albans operation . 
 " <unk> " is the tenth episode of the eighth season of the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It premiered on the Fox network on January 21 , 2001 . The episode was written by John Shiban and directed by Tony <unk> . " <unk> " is a " Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week " story , unconnected to the series ' wider mythology . The episode received a Nielsen rating of 7 @.@ 3 and was viewed by 11 @.@ 8 million viewers . Overall , the episode received mostly negative reviews from critics . 
 The series centers on FBI special agents Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) and her new partner John Doggett ( Robert Patrick ) — following the alien abduction of her former partner , Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) — who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . When a mystic <unk> himself out of India , Scully and Doggett give chase as his murderous <unk> starts <unk> two families in suburban Washington , D.C. But Scully soon comes upon a crisis of faith when she realises how <unk> her techniques are from those of Mulder , even as she tries to be the believer . 
 " <unk> " was inspired by stories of Indian <unk> as well as the idea of someone asking for money actually being " a bad guy . " <unk> Roy , a noted <unk> better known as Deep Roy , was chosen to play the part of the antagonistic <unk> . The episode 's title means " <unk> " or " revenge " in Hindi . 
 At the <unk> International Airport in Mumbai , India , an American businessman <unk> makes his way past a <unk> <unk> . Later , while using the airport 's toilet , the businessman is pulled out of the stall <unk> by the <unk> that he passed earlier . Later , the man checks into a Washington , D.C. hotel and sits down on his bed . Soon , blood streams out of his bodily <unk> . 
 Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) arrives late to the crime scene and John Doggett ( Robert Patrick ) tells her that the man 's blood all drained abruptly in the hotel . A child ’ s bloody print is found , but Scully doesn ’ t believe that a child did this . Meanwhile , the <unk> , somehow disguised as an ordinary looking Caucasian man , applies for a <unk> job at a <unk> , Maryland elementary school . In the morgue , Scully describes the massive stomach damage done to the body which leads Doggett to the idea of drugs being forcibly cut out of him . However , the man showed no sign of drugs in the blood tests and Scully tells Doggett that his time of death was 24 to 36 hours prior , long before he left India . Due to a discrepancy in weight , she begins to believe that there was a passenger in the corpse . 
 <unk> , a student at the school mentioned before , calls his father after he sees the <unk> <unk> man in his room at night . His father tells him that it was his imagination , goes back <unk> , but then screams . <unk> rushes down to find his father dead and his eyes turned red with blood . Doggett and Scully investigate this latest death after the police told them about the strange man the boy saw . While discussing the lack of any damage to the body except the broken blood vessels in the eyes , Scully comes to the conclusion that the man is still inside the latest victim . She rushes to the morgue and finds the boy ’ s father with a <unk> belly . She cuts into him and then sees a hand emerge from the <unk> <unk> . After being temporarily knocked over , she follows a bloody trail , opens a door at the end of the trail , and finds no one there . Unbeknownst to her , however , the <unk> is watching her , <unk> . 
 At the school , the principal tells the <unk> man ’ s <unk> guise that she was very worried when he did not show up that morning . Trevor , a <unk> who had earlier tormented <unk> , sees partially through the <unk> 's forms for a moment . Trevor later shows up at <unk> ’ s home to say he is sorry and says he thinks he knows who killed his father . 
 Scully and Doggett consult Chuck <unk> , an old friend of Fox Mulder 's ( David Duchovny ) , who tells the two that <unk> <unk> could do the things Scully described ; the <unk> have powers of the mind and can alter people ’ s perceptions of reality . Scully <unk> that a mystic is acting out of revenge since an American plant inadvertently released a gas cloud that killed 118 people in <unk> , outside of Mumbai . One of the victims was the 11 @-@ year @-@ old son of a holy man of the <unk> caste . 
 " <unk> " was written by John Shiban and inspired by stories of Indian <unk> . In fact , the episode 's title means " to <unk> " or " to revenge " in <unk> . Further inspiration came " from a little bit of <unk> " according to Shiban . He later recalled that he was walking through the Vancouver airport and suddenly had the thought , " What if someone who came up to me and asked me for money was actually a bad guy . " Shiban later noted that his early drafts of the episode featured the antagonist with a different power . He explained , " My original idea was a <unk> with no legs who can actually <unk> himself and climb inside your ear , and Chris Carter – and this is why he 's Chris Carter – said ' No , no , no ! I know what 's even better . ' " Shiban later said that " ... one thing about this episode that I 'm sort of proud is that people often have told me that it is the most <unk> thought that they ever had , that this little man would actually enter your body and travel around inside you . " 
 The scenes featuring the Indian airport were filmed at a cruise line terminal in Long Beach , California . <unk> Jones , the location manager for the series , felt that the " dated feel " of the terminal added to the scene . He noted , " if you look at <unk> footage of India , they always have old English cars from the sixties , the cruise line terminal in Long Beach was perfect . " 
 Producer Paul <unk> was <unk> with the final episode , noting , " ' <unk> ' was the one episode I did not like the most [ ... ] I think if I had done it different , I would have had John Shiban change the method of transportation . I don 't think it ever worked on any level for me . It was just weird and creepy , but I think the whole idea was <unk> to me . " He later <unk> concluded that " it 's the only episode that I kind of wish we hadn 't done . " 
 " <unk> " first aired on Fox on 21 January 2001 . The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 7 @.@ 3 , meaning that it was seen by 7 @.@ 3 % of the nation 's estimated households . The episode was viewed by 7 @.@ 46 million households and 11 @.@ 8 million viewers . The episode ranked as the 50th most @-@ watched episode for the week ending January 21 . The episode subsequently debuted in the United Kingdom on the BBC Two on May 12 , 2002 . Fox promoted the episode with the tagline " Imagine a man who can <unk> into a <unk> ... a <unk> ... or a victim . " 
 Critical reception to the episode was mostly negative . Television Without Pity writer Jessica Morgan rated the episode a " C " and criticized the episode 's plot holes , such as how the <unk> escaped back to India after being shot by Scully . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated the episode two stars out of five . The two noted that the episode was " best " when " it 's at its most <unk> " , citing the <unk> " <unk> up the bottom of an <unk> man " as " pretty <unk> " . Shearman and Pearson , however , noted that it suffered from the fact that " it doesn 't have the courage of its convictions " . 
 Despite the <unk> , several reviews wrote positively of the episode 's antagonistic <unk> . Both TV Guide and UGO Networks listed him amongst the greatest monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ week characters in The X @-@ Files . The UGO review , in particular , noted that the character was " One of the series ' more blatant <unk> [ ... ] , as a <unk> Indian Mystic [ ... ] literally climbs into his victims to travel where he will .

 Jonathan Jennings ( March 27 , 1784 – July 26 , 1834 ) was the first governor of Indiana and a nine @-@ term congressman from Indiana . Born in either <unk> County , New Jersey , or <unk> County , Virginia , he studied law before <unk> to the Indiana Territory in 1806 . Jennings initially intended to practice law , but took jobs as an assistant at the federal land office at <unk> and assistant to the clerk of the territorial legislature to support himself , and pursued interests in land speculation and politics . Jennings became involved in a dispute with the territorial governor , William Henry Harrison , that soon led him to enter politics and set the tone for his early political career . In 1808 Jennings moved to the eastern part of the Indiana Territory and settled near <unk> , in Clark County . He was elected as the Indiana Territory 's delegate to the U.S. Congress by dividing the pro @-@ Harrison supporters and running as an anti @-@ Harrison candidate . By 1812 he was the leader of the anti @-@ slavery and pro @-@ statehood faction of the territorial government . Jennings and his political allies took control of the territorial assembly and dominated governmental affairs after the resignation of Governor Harrison in 1812 . As a congressional delegate Jennings aided passage of the <unk> Act in 1816 , which authorized the organization of Indiana 's state government and state constitution . He was elected president of the Indiana constitutional convention , held in <unk> in June 1816 , where he helped draft the state 's first constitution . Jennings supported the effort to ban slavery in the state and favored a strong legislative branch of government . 
 In August 1816 Jennings was elected to serve as the first governor of Indiana at age 32 , and re @-@ elected for an additional term . He pressed for the construction of roads and schools , and negotiated the Treaty of St. Mary 's to open up central Indiana to American settlement . His opponents attacked his participation in the treaty negotiations as unconstitutional and brought <unk> proceedings against him , a measure that was narrowly defeated by a vote of 15 to 13 after a month @-@ long investigation and the resignation of the lieutenant governor . During his second term and following the panic of 1819 , Jennings encountered financial problems , a situation exacerbated by his inability to keep up with his business interests and run the state government simultaneously . <unk> for another term as Indiana governor under the state constitution , Jennings looked for other means of financial support . Shortly before completion of his second term as governor in 1822 , Jennings was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives , before retiring from public service in 1831 . In Congress Jennings promoted federal spending on internal improvements . 
 Jennings had been a heavy <unk> of alcohol for much of his life . His addiction worsened after the death of his first wife , Ann , and his development of <unk> . Jennings 's <unk> led to defeat in his reelection campaign in 1830 . In retirement his condition worsened and he was unable to work his farm . When his finances collapsed , his <unk> sought to take his land holdings and <unk> farm . To protect his friend , U.S. Senator John <unk> purchased Jennings 's farm and permitted him to continue living there . After Jennings 's death , his estate was sold , but it left no funds to purchase a <unk> for his grave , which remained unmarked for fifty @-@ seven years . 
 Historians have offered varied interpretations of Jennings 's life and impact on the development of Indiana . Early state historians , Jacob <unk> Dunn Jr. and William Wesley <unk> , gave Jennings high praise and credited him with the defeat of the pro @-@ slavery forces in Indiana and with laying the foundation of the state . More critical historians during the prohibition era , such as Logan <unk> , described Jennings as a <unk> and self @-@ promoting politician and focused on his <unk> . Among the modern historians , Randy Mills places Jennings 's importance between the two extremes , but agreed with <unk> 's assessment that the state " <unk> him more than she can <unk> . " 
 In 1806 Jennings headed west to <unk> in the Indiana Territory , but stayed only briefly . He moved to <unk> , the capital of the Indiana Territory , in early 1807 to open his own law practice and was admitted to the bar in April . Jennings had difficulty earning an income as a lawyer , finding there were too few clients in the territory to keep him busy . In July 1807 Nathaniel Ewing , the federal land receiver at <unk> and a friend from Pennsylvania , invited Jennings to take a job as assistant to John <unk> , the <unk> at the federal land office in <unk> . Along with <unk> , Jennings engaged in land speculation . He obtained significant land holdings and made substantial profits . In 1807 Jennings became an assistant to the clerk of the territorial legislature and continued to speculate on the sale of public lands . 
 In August 1807 Jennings was appointed clerk of the <unk> University board of trustees and began to be drawn into ongoing political disputes going on territory . The territorial governor , William Henry Harrison , was a member and president of the board . As governor of the Indiana Territory , Harrison wielded considerable influence through his political appointments and veto powers . Jennings received the university appointment after General Washington Johnston resigned as clerk of the board following a dispute over Harrison 's proposal to ban the French residents of <unk> from using the university 's <unk> . The board defeated Harrison 's proposal , but Johnston resigned as its clerk and Jennings was selected as his replacement over Henry <unk> , one of Harrison 's loyal supporters . Harrison was outraged and promptly resigned from the board , but later <unk> his decision . In September 1807 Harrison was easily reelected to the board and selected as its president . In the meantime , Johnston wrote a pamphlet describing the board 's proceedings , which Jennings certified without the board 's knowledge or approval . Jennings further angered Harrison when he attempted to secure a <unk> in the territorial legislature . Jennings 's opponent for the <unk> was the anti @-@ slavery candidate Davis Floyd , an enemy of Harrison . After Jennings dropped out of the race , Floyd was selected for the position and became an important political ally to Jennings . In April 1808 , with Harrison reelected as president of the <unk> University board , a commission was appointed to investigate Jennings 's conduct . The committee 's inquiry concerned Jennings 's certification of Johnston 's pamphlet dealing with board proceedings without their knowledge . The incident led to Jennings 's resignation in 1808 and created a considerable amount of <unk> between the two that prevailed for many years . 
 By March 1808 , Jennings believed that his future in the Harrison @-@ dominated western part of the territory was bleak . By November he had left <unk> and moved to <unk> , in Clark County , Indiana Territory , before settling in nearby <unk> . Jennings may have believed his political future would have more success in the eastern part of the territory . <unk> in the southeast and eastern portion of the territory opposed slavery and Harrison 's aristocratic manner , which were similar to Jennings 's beliefs , while the western portion of the territory and <unk> area remained <unk> . Although <unk> to allow slavery were received before the formation of the Indiana Territory , the issue attracted widespread attention in 1807 when Harrison and his supporters in the territorial legislature revived efforts to allow slavery in the territory . Jennings and his supporters who opposed slavery wrote writing articles appearing in the <unk> Western Sun newspaper attacking Harrison 's administration , its pro @-@ slavery sentiments , and aristocratic policies . 
 In 1808 , when Congressman Benjamin <unk> resigned from office , Harrison ordered a special election to fill the vacancy . Jennings entered the race against Harrison 's candidate , Thomas Randolph , the attorney general for the territory , and John Johnson , a <unk> native who had the support of the <unk> group . Randolph promised not to introduce slavery into the territory unless the majority of his constituents agreed , while Johnson remained silent on the issue . Jennings , an <unk> candidate from the eastern portion of the territory , <unk> from settlement to settlement to give speeches against slavery . Jennings spoke against what he believed to be Randolph 's aristocratic tendencies , ties to Harrison 's territorial government , and the issue of slavery in the territory . Jennings found his greatest support among the growing Quaker community in the eastern part of the territory . 
 On November 27 , 1809 , Jennings was elected as a delegate to the <unk> Congress . The election was close . Jennings beat Randolph , <unk> votes to 402 , with Johnson taking 81 votes . Randolph challenged the election results and traveled to Washington D.C. to take his case to the U.S. House of Representatives . Randolph claimed that election officials in <unk> County did not follow proper procedures for <unk> ninety @-@ one votes in the county 's seventh district and argued that the votes should be deducted from the vote totals . Once discarded , the revised totals would make Randolph the winner . A House committee took up the case , issued a resolution in Randolph 's favor , and recommended that a new election be held . Randolph immediately left for the Indiana Territory to launch a new campaign for the seat , but the House defeated the committee 's recommendation by an 83 to 30 vote margin and Jennings was permitted to take his seat . As a territorial delegate in Congress , Jennings learned the legislative process , served on House committees , introduced legislation , debated issues , and continued his ongoing crusade against Governor Harrison . Jennings did not play a major role in congressional discussions , but he did make an effort to represent the interests of his constituents . He was reelected in 1811 , 1812 , and 1814 . 
 During his first session in Congress , Jennings had a small portrait of himself made , which he later gave to Ann Gilmore Hay , the daughter of a prominent <unk> politician , whom he had recently begun courting . Hay was born in <unk> , Kentucky , in 1792 . Her family moved to Clark County in Indiana Territory , and settled in <unk> . Jennings first met her when he was campaigning for Congress in 1809 . After his first session in Congress ended , Jennings returned to Indiana Territory and married eighteen @-@ year @-@ old Ann on August 8 , 1811 . Ann 's father had just died leaving her with no family or means of support . Following his reelection to Congress in 1811 , the couple returned to Washington , where she remained briefly , before traveling to Pennsylvania to live with Jennings 's sister , Ann Mitchell , for the remainder of the session . Jennings 's wife suffered from ill health , which deteriorated after he became governor of Indiana in 1816 , and she died after a protected illness in 1826 . Later that year Jennings married Clarissa <unk> , who had come from Kentucky to teach at the <unk> <unk> . Jennings had no children from either marriage . 
 <unk> over his electoral loss , Randolph <unk> anti @-@ Harrison supporters , even challenging one to a duel . He was stabbed three times , but recovered and challenged Jennings in his bid for reelection in 1810 . Harrison came out to personally stump on Randolph 's behalf . Jennings focused on the slavery issue and tied Randolph to Harrison 's continued attempts to <unk> the institution . The congressional election coincided with the first popular election of delegates to the territorial legislature . In 1809 , a year prior to the election , the territory 's pro @-@ slavery faction suffered a significant setback when Illinois was separated from the Indiana Territory , cutting Harrison off from his supporters in the western portion of the territory . Harrison suggested that Jennings further expanded his political base by <unk> among the disaffected French residents of the territory . Jennings 's defeat of Randolph in 1810 repudiated Harrison 's pro @-@ slavery policies . Following his triumph in the election , Jennings 's and his anti @-@ slavery allies were successful in <unk> a legislative agenda that limited the territorial governor 's authority and repealed an 1805 act regarding indentured service . 
 In his first full term in Congress , Jennings stepped up his attacks on Harrison , accusing him of using his office for personal gain , of taking part in questionable land speculation deals , and <unk> raising tensions with the Native American tribes on the frontier . Jennings presented a congressional resolution that intended to reduce Harrison 's authority to make political appointments and opposed his policy of purchasing lands from the Indians . When Harrison was up for <unk> as territorial governor in 1810 , Jennings sent a scathing letter to President James Madison that argued against his <unk> . Harrison 's allies in Washington argued on his behalf and aided in securing his <unk> . 
 After hostilities broke out on the frontier between the Americans and the native tribes , culminating in the Battle of <unk> in November 1811 , Jennings successfully promoted passage of a bill to grant compensation to veterans of the battle and to give <unk> for five years to the widows and orphans of those who were killed . <unk> , Jennings lamented the battle , while his friends in the territory faulted Harrison for <unk> the situation and causing the <unk> loss of life . As calls for war with Great Britain increased , Jennings was not among the war hawks , but ultimately accepted the arrival of the War of 1812 . Early in the war , Harrison was commissioned as a military general and dispatched to defend the frontier and invade Canada , which caused him to resign from his post as territorial governor in 1812 . Prior to Harrison 's resignation , Jennings and his allies moved quickly to take advantage of the situation and initiated efforts to weaken the governor 's authority . In 1811 the territorial legislature voted to move the capital away from <unk> , a pro @-@ Harrison stronghold , and began a shift in political power from the territorial governor to the delegates in the territorial legislature and its elected officials . John Gibson , the elderly , acting governor , whose territorial duties largely dealt with military affairs , did not challenge the territorial legislature . When Harrison 's successor , Thomas <unk> , was confirmed on March 3 , 1813 , Jennings 's party in the territorial legislature had become entrenched and began to advance their request for statehood . 
 Jennings ran for reelection to Congress in 1811 against another pro @-@ slavery candidate , Waller Taylor . The campaign was the most divisive in Jennings 's career . Taylor derided Jennings as a " <unk> <unk> " and went so far as to challenge Jennings to a duel , but he refused . Jennings ran on the slavery issue again , fielding his new motto , " No slavery in Indiana " . Jennings 's supporters tied Taylor , a territorial judge , to the pro @-@ slavery movement . Jennings easily won reelection , thanks to an expanding base of support that included the growing community of <unk> . Following his reelection , Jennings developed <unk> , an illness often caused by <unk> , but he recovered . During his third term in Congress , Jennings began advocating that statehood be granted to Indiana , but held off formally introducing legislation until the end of the War of 1812 . Jennings ran against Elijah Sparks in his 1814 reelection campaign and easily won . 
 By 1815 Jennings and the territorial legislature were ready to embark on a course for statehood . In December 1815 Jennings 's introduced a petition from the territorial legislature to Congress that requested statehood for Indiana . The 1815 census showed the territory had a population exceeding 63 @,@ 000 , more than the minimum requirement for statehood under the Northwest <unk> of 1787 . The House began a debate on the measure and passed the <unk> Act on April 11 , 1816 . The act granted Indiana the right to form a government and elect delegates to a constitutional convention that would create a state constitution . The territorial governor , Thomas <unk> , expressed concern that the territory was too under @-@ populated to provide sufficient tax revenue to fund a state government . In a letter to President Madison , he recommended that the president veto the bill and delay statehood for another three years , which would allow him to finish his term as governor . Madison signed the bill , ignoring <unk> 's plea . 
 Dennis <unk> , a leading member of the territorial legislature , was able to secure the election of many anti @-@ slavery delegates to the constitutional convention . Jennings was a delegate from Clark County . At the convention , held in June 1816 in the new territorial capital of <unk> , Jennings was elected president of the assembly , which permitted him to appoint the convention 's committee <unk> . Although the delegates drafted a new constitution for Indiana , the majority of the content was copied from other state <unk> , most notably Ohio and Kentucky . A few items were new and unique to Indiana . <unk> , which was already prohibited in territorial legislation , was banned in the Indiana constitution ; however , contracts for indentured servants , if they were already in existence , were preserved . The new state government , divided into legislative , executive , and judicial branches , gave the governor limited powers and concentrated authority in the hands of the Indiana General Assembly and county officials . Shortly after the convention , Jennings publicly announced his candidacy for governor . 
 At the state convention in June 1816 Jennings may have informed some of the delegates that he intended to run for governor and by early July 1816 he had publicly announced his candidacy . Thomas <unk> , Indiana 's last territorial governor , was Jennings 's opponent . <unk> announced his own candidacy for governor prior to the convention 's <unk> on June 29 , 1816 . With just five weeks before the August 5 election , there was little active campaigning . <unk> , who thought Indiana statehood was premature , was not a popular candidate and suffered from health issues . Jennings won by a large majority , 5 @,@ <unk> votes to 3 @,@ <unk> . Most of Jennings 's votes probably came from the eastern portion of the state , where his support was particularly strong , while <unk> 's probably came from the western portion . Jennings moved to the new state capital at <unk> , where he served the duration of his term as governor . 
 Jennings 's salary as governor , which was the highest for an elected official in the state , was $ 1 @,@ 000 . Under the constitution , the governor served a three @-@ year term and was prohibited from serving more that six years in a nine @-@ year period . Jennings 's agenda called for establishing court proceedings to secure justice , organizing a state @-@ funded educational systems , creating a state banking system , preventing unlawful seizure and <unk> of free blacks , organizing a state library , and planning internal improvements . His efforts had limited success , due , in part , to the state 's limited financial resources and Jennings 's limited powers as governor . 
 Jennings strongly condemned slavery in his inauguration speech and as governor , he refined his stance on the institution . On November 7 , 1816 , Jennings encouraged the state legislature to enact laws to prevent " unlawful attempts to seize and carry into bondage persons of color legally entitled to their freedom " while preventing " those who <unk> owe service to the citizens of any other State or Territory , from seeking , within the limits of this state , a refuge from the possession of their lawful owners . " In 1817 Jennings acknowledged a <unk> of his earlier position regarding fugitive slaves by claiming it was needed to " preserve harmony " among the states . Jennings agreed to allow citizens " the means of <unk> any slave escaping to this State that may <unk> belong to them … with as little delay as possible " after citizens of Kentucky had difficulty <unk> their slaves who had escaped to Indiana . 
 In 1818 , Jennings began promoting a large @-@ scale plan for internal improvements in the state . Most of the projects were directed toward construction of roads , canals , and other projects to enhance the commercial appeal and economic viability of the state . During Jennings 's second term the state government continued to support public improvements , with new road construction and expanded settlement into central Indiana . After Indianapolis became the site for the state 's permanent capital in 1821 and new settlers arrived in the area , the Indiana General Assembly appropriated $ 100 @,@ 000 for new road construction and improvements to some of the more important routes , but it was considerably short of the amount needed . 
 The state experienced budget shortages because of low tax revenues , which forced Jennings to pursue other means of financing the projects . The main sources of funds came from issuing government bonds to the state bank and sales of public lands . The state 's spending and <unk> led to short @-@ term budget problems , but despite early setbacks ( poor access to capital eventually halted improvement programs and caused the Indiana Canal Company to fold because of lack of funds ) , the infrastructure improvements initiated by Jennings attracted new settlers to the state . By 1810 the Indiana Territory 's population within the boundaries of the new state was 24 , 520 . In the decades following his governorship , Indiana 's population grew from sixty @-@ five thousand in 1816 to 147 @,@ 178 in 1820 and surpassed one million by 1850 . 
 In his first inaugural speech in August 1816 , Jennings called attention to the need for an educational plan . In his 1817 annual message to the state legislature , he encouraged the establishment of a free , state @-@ funded education system , as called for in the state constitution , but few of the state 's citizens were willing to impose taxes to fund public schools . The state legislature believed priority should be given to creating government infrastructure . <unk> of public funds postponed creation of a state library system until Governor James B. Ray 's administration in 1826 . 
 From the beginning the state 's banking institutions were closely tied to the state government 's fiscal affairs , made even more challenging due to the state 's " extremely limited economic and population base " , the economic depression of the late teens and early twenties , a lack of experience in banking on the part of state politicians and citizens , and other factors . " Indiana banking rested on <unk> foundation even in the prosperous years preceding the Panic of 1819 . " To remedy the problem , Jennings signed legislation in 1817 to create the First State Bank of Indiana by converting the Bank of <unk> , established under a territorial charter in 1814 , into the new bank 's main headquarters and established three new branches at <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . The First State Bank soon became a <unk> of federal funds and was involved in land speculation . The <unk> and <unk> Bank of Madison , established in 1814 , chose to remain separate from the state bank under a territorial charter that was valid until 1835 . 
 Most of Jennings second term was spent grappling with the state 's continuing financial difficulties . When tax revenues and land sales remained low , the state 's revenue was not sufficient to <unk> the bonds it used to finance internal improvements . The Indiana General Assembly was forced to significantly <unk> the value of its bonds , <unk> the state 's credit and making it difficult to secure new loans . 
 During his tenure as governor Jennings nominated three candidates to the Indiana Supreme Court : John Johnson , James Scott , and Jesse Lynch <unk> . All three were quickly confirmed by the state legislature . 
 In late 1818 , Jennings was appointed as a federal commissioner , along with Lewis Cass and Benjamin <unk> , to negotiate a treaty with the Native Americans ( <unk> , <unk> , Miami , and Delaware ) , who lived in the northern and central parts of Indiana . The Treaty of St. Mary 's allowed the State of Indiana to purchase millions of acres of land north of an 1809 treaty line and extending west to the <unk> River and two more <unk> of land , which opened most of central Indiana to American settlement . The appointment created a crisis in Jennings 's political career . Because the state constitution prohibited a person from holding a federal government position while exercising duties as the state 's governor , Jennings 's political enemies seized the opportunity to force him from office by arguing that he had vacated the governor 's office when he accepted the federal appointment . 
 Lieutenant Governor Christopher Harrison claimed that Jennings had " abandoned " his elected office and took over as the state 's acting governor in Jennings 's absence . In the meantime the Indiana House of Representatives launched an investigation . When Jennings learned of the situation , he was " <unk> " that his actions were being questioned and burned the documents he received from the federal government that related to his assignment . The legislature called Jennings and Harrison to appear for questioning ; however , Jennings declined , stating the assembly did not have the authority to <unk> him , and Harrison refused to appear unless the assembly recognized him as the acting governor . Because neither of the two men would meet with the legislature , the assembly demanded copies of the documents that Jennings received from the federal government to prove he was not acting as its agent . Jennings responded : 
 If I were in possession of any public documents calculated to advance the public interest , it would give me pleasure to <unk> them , and I shall at all times be prepared to afford you any information which the constitution or laws of the State may require .... If the difficulty , real or supposed , has grown out of the circumstances of my having been connected with the negotiation at St Mary 's , I feel it my duty to state to the committee that I acted from an entire conviction of its <unk> and an anxious desire , on my part , to promote the welfare and accomplish the wishes of the whole people of the State in assisting to add a large and fertile tract of country to that which we already possess . 
 The legislature summoned everyone in the surrounding area who had any knowledge of the events at Saint Mary 's , but found that no one was certain of Jennings 's role in the commission . After a short debate , the House passed a resolution , voting 15 to 13 , to recognize Jennings as governor and dropped it proceedings against him . The House votes opposing Jennings came largely from the state 's western counties . Harrison was outraged by the decision and resigned as lieutenant governor . 
 In 1820 Harrison ran against Jennings in his reelection bid . Jennings won the election by a large majority , 11 @,@ 256 votes to Harrison 's 2 @,@ 008 . Jennings 's win by a three @-@ to @-@ one margin suggests he remained a popular politician and the state 's voters were not overly concerned by attacks on the governor 's character . 
 Jennings 's personal finances suffered from the panic of 1819 , while the Indiana governorship continued to increase his financial burden . Jennings was never able to recover from his debts . One historian suggests that Jennings 's financial situation may arisen from the expenses incurred during his political campaigns , his long @-@ time service in state government , and being too busy to adequately manage his farm . Jennings and his wife frequently entertained visitors , legislators , and other dignitaries at their <unk> home . At a high @-@ profile dinner in 1819 , he hosted President James Monroe and General Andrew Jackson at a dinner held in their honor in <unk> , when the two leaders were making a tour of the frontier states . In 1822 Jennings solicited a $ 1 @,@ 000 personal loan from the <unk> in a letter to his political ally , George <unk> , but his request was denied . Jennings was able to secure personal loans from friends by granting <unk> on his land . Earlier in his career as a land speculator at <unk> , when land prices decreased significantly , he was forced to sell several tracts of land at a loss . 
 By the late 1820s Jennings was critically short of cash . He depended on income from political office to pay his expenses . His farm was not likely to provide sufficient financial support . Because the thirty @-@ eight @-@ year @-@ old Jennings was prohibited by law from running for reelection to a third term as Indiana governor in 1823 , he was forced to consider other political options . Jennings decided to return to Congress . 
 In September 1822 , shortly before his second term as governor expired , Jennings became a candidate for Congress after William <unk> resigned his seat to run for Indiana governor . A special election was held on August 5 , 1822 , to fill <unk> 's vacant seat in Congress . At the same time , the state 's increased population gave Indiana three congressional seats . A regular congressional election was held on the same day to elect three Indiana <unk> . Jennings and Davis Floyd were the principal candidates in the special election , which Jennings won . In the regular election to fill the seat for Indiana 's Second Congressional District , Jennings easily won , defeating James Scott by a wide margin . Jennings became a Democratic @-@ Republican to the 17th Congress and Lieutenant Governor <unk> Boon succeeded him as governor . <unk> ran unopposed and was subsequently elected as governor to succeed Boon . Jennings won reelection to Congress and represented Indiana 's Second District until in 1830 . He became a <unk> Republican in the 18th Congress , but switched his allegiance , becoming an Adams Republican in the 19th and 20th <unk> , and then aligned with the Anti @-@ <unk> in the 21st Congress . 
 Jennings continued to promote internal infrastructure improvements throughout his term in Congress . He introduced legislation to build more forts in the northwest , to grant federal funding for improvement projects in Indiana and Ohio , and led the debate in support of using federal funds to build the nations longest canal , <unk> and Erie Canal , through Indiana . He introduced a legislative amendment that made a provision to locate and survey the National Road to the west , toward the Mississippi River , so the people living in Indiana and Illinois would have some assurance that the road 's large federal appropriation would benefit them directly . Jennings helped secure appropriation of funds to survey the <unk> River and make it more accessible to year @-@ round steamboat travel . 
 In his reelection as the Second District congressman , Jennings supported <unk> protection and internal improvements and vowed to support the presidential candidate that his constituents preferred if the election went to the House to decide the winner . Jennings won reelection to Congress in a close race , beating Jeremiah Sullivan of Madison . In the presidential election of 1824 American political parties organized around three candidates : Andrew Jackson running against John <unk> Adams and Henry Clay . Jennings favored Adams , and later , Clay ; however , when the contested presidential election passed to the House in 1825 , Jennings voted with the majority and gave his political support to Jackson , but he was defeated in the House and Adams became president . Indiana voters who supported Jackson hoped for a victory in the next election . 
 Jennings , seeking to advance his political career , ran for the Senate twice , but was defeated in both attempts . In 1825 he was a <unk> candidate at a time when the Indiana General Assembly elected the state 's <unk> to Congress . On the first ballot Isaac <unk> came in first , the incumbent governor , William <unk> , came in second , and Jennings was third . On the fourth ballot <unk> won the <unk> seat . In his second attempt Jennings lost to James Noble . 
 Jennings 's wife died in 1826 after a protected illness ; the couple had no children . Jennings was deeply <unk> by her loss and began to drink liquor more heavily . Later that year he married Clarissa <unk> , but his drinking condition only worsened and he was frequently <unk> . 
 While serving in Congress , Jennings 's health continued to decline as he struggled with alcohol addiction and suffered from severe <unk> . In 1827 ceiling plaster from Jennings 's Washington D.C. boarding room fell on his head , severely injuring him , and ill health limited his ability to visit his constituents , but he continued to remain a popular politician in Indiana . In the congressional election of 1826 , Jennings ran unopposed . He won reelection in 1828 , soundly defeating his opponent , Indiana 's lieutenant governor , John H. Thompson . Jennings did not publicly favor a presidential candidate and won the Second District seat with support from voters who favored Jackson and Adams . During Jennings 's final term in office House journals show that he introduced no legislation , was frequently not present to vote on matters , and only once delivered a speech . Jennings 's friends , led by Senator John <unk> , took note of his situation and took action to block Jennings 's reelection bid when his drinking became a political liability . John Carr , anti @-@ Jackson man , opposed Jennings in a six @-@ way race for the congressional seat and won the election . <unk> had arranged for others to enter the race and divide Jennings 's supporters . Jennings left office on March 3 , 1831 . 
 Jennings was twice @-@ elected Grand Master of the Indiana Grand Lodge of <unk> , serving in 1824 and 1825 . He declined reelection in 1825 . 
 Jennings died of a heart attack , most likely brought on by another bout with <unk> , on July 26 , 1834 , at his farm near <unk> . He was fifty years old . Jennings was buried after a brief ceremony in an unmarked grave . His estate lacked the funds to purchase a <unk> . Jennings 's <unk> , many of whom were his neighbors , were left unpaid and <unk> . Following Jennings 's death , <unk> sold the Jennings farm to Joseph Carr and gave Jennings 's widow a $ 100 gift from the proceeds . 
 In the late nineteenth century several attempts were made to erect a monument honoring Jennings 's public service . On three separate occasions , in 1861 , 1869 and 1889 , <unk> were brought before the Indiana General Assembly to erect a marker for Jennings 's grave , but each attempt failed . In 1892 the state legislature finally granted the petition to erect a monument in his honor . Around the same time , after Jennings 's unmarked <unk> was independently verified by three witnesses to his burial , his body was exhumed and <unk> at a new site at the <unk> cemetery . 
 Modern historians , Howard <unk> , Randy Mills , Andrew R. L. <unk> , and Dorothy Riker , argue that Jennings 's legacy may lie " somewhere between the two extremes " of Dunn 's and <unk> 's assessments . Mills agrees with <unk> that Indiana <unk> Jennings a debt of gratitude . Although Jennings 's accomplishments were not extensive , he did a " <unk> " job for his stewardship of a state in " transition to a more democratic form of government " . <unk> describes Jennings as " ambitious " , " passionate " , " hot @-@ tempered " , and " moody " . He argues that Jennings was a successful <unk> , but an " indifferent " statesman and governor who was " not very good at laying out an agenda and achieving its implementation " . 
 Jennings believed in popular democracy , opposed slavery , and despised <unk> , especially William Henry Harrison , for " <unk> on the rights of his fellow Americans . " His service as Indiana 's governor and representative to Congress came at the end of one political era and the beginning of another , when governmental power and authority shifted from the governor and his patronage appointments to the state legislature and elected officials . 
 A More Perfect Union : <unk> New American Rights or simply A More Perfect Union is non @-@ fiction political analysis written by United States Congressman Jesse Jackson , Jr. in collaboration with Frank <unk> Watkins is a political theorist , activist and was the press secretary to Jackson at the time . It was released in hardcover format on October 15 , 2001 and in paperback format on April 25 , 2008 . The material for Jackson 's book , his third , came from three trips he took in 1997 – 98 to American Civil War <unk> . Although Watkins is credited , the biographical content of the book is written as a first person narrative as if written solely by Jackson . 
 The National Park Service has twenty @-@ eight national Civil War historic sites . Jackson and White visited approximately twenty <unk> in August 1997 , December 1997 and the spring of 1998 . Jackson 's wife , <unk> Jackson , participated in the third trip . The trips heightened a belief of Jackson 's that race as it relates to African Americans has been the focal point of social and political existence in American history . Since Jackson is not the first to present such a realization , he presents a North @-@ South schism lens through which to view the congressional politics of race . 
 The book contains about 75 pages of biographical / autobiographical content which provide context for the subsequent political analysis . Critical reviews do not analyze the biographical content . Instead , the reviews focus on the political analysis of race , economic issues , geographical divide , and states ' rights as well as the constitutional amendments proposed in this book . 
 The title of the book comes from the <unk> to the United States Constitution . The <unk> includes the phrase " in Order to form a more perfect Union " as the first specifically mentioned purpose of the United States Constitution . 
 The book has several sections . The first four chapters relate autobiographical details to his experience in touring the Civil War battle sites . In the subsequent section , he discusses <unk> . In the third section he describes his economic plan . Then , Jackson outlines eight constitutional amendments . In the final section , he discusses achieving these policy goals set forth in the third and fourth sections . On March 4 , 2003 , Jackson proposed these eight amendments . The book includes full chapters for each amendment . The eight amendments are as follows : 
 The Education Amendment which reads " ( 1 ) All persons shall enjoy the right to a public education of equal high quality ; and ( 2 ) The Congress shall have the power to enforce and implement this article by appropriate legislation , " has received public attention for several years . Jackson feels that his amendment is a natural response to San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez , <unk> U.S. 1 ( 1973 ) , which determined that an education is not a <unk> protected fundamental right . 
 An important theme of the book is the North @-@ South relationship as it influences the extent of <unk> in the United States . The book describes how from before the Civil War to well after the Civil Rights Movement the balance of power between <unk> of state 's rights and defenders of the federal government have battled over resources and power along North @-@ South <unk> . Jackson is a <unk> of state 's rights and feels that the extensive power given to states has slowed our broad distribution of social goods by perpetuating inequality and thus unrest . <unk> also notes that Jackson attempts to bring class to the forefront of the discourse in an effort to offer a political vision toward social <unk> and equality . He says Jackson views race as the lens to <unk> view American history and views economic issues as the hearing aid through which the politics of today can best be heard . 
 In a review for the Chicago Sun @-@ Times , Michael Eric <unk> described the book as " <unk> accomplished and remarkably <unk> " . He views Jackson 's eight new amendments as " the political backbone and intellectual infrastructure for the expression of a new politics of race and class that strengthen the status of all suffering Americans . " He encourages understanding the book because it provides a fresh social perspective to addresses current fundamental American political and racial problems . 
 Writing for the Chicago Tribune , Playboy editor John Thomas described the amendments as sensible , but pointed out that some view them as an attempt to <unk> policy decisions . Thomas perceived the benefit of the plan to be the fact that the force of the constitution would uphold the amendments , and that this would <unk> actions to support both political promises and the constitutional tenets . 
 At one stop on the book tour associated with the publication and release of the book at the David A. Clarke School of Law of the University of the District of Columbia , Jackson 's message was perceived as saying that American history can be studied as an analysis of race , but that economics and the tension between states ’ rights and federal rights are the true basis of a domestic history revolving around pursuit of economic development , political power , and personal freedom . He then advanced the theory that these <unk> would most be most readily attained by adopting a set of new constitutional amendments , <unk> rights primarily grounded in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , which the U.S. has ratified . Each is discussed in a separate chapter : the rights to quality health care , housing , education , a clean environment , fair taxes , full employment , equality for women , and the right to vote . 
 During the promotion of the book there was a controversy when a book @-@ signing party in <unk> , Illinois <unk> into a fundraiser without Jackson 's knowledge . When Jackson realized what happened he wrote to the Federal Election Commission and the House <unk> Committee to explain what happened and seek their advice . Jackson decided to return the entire $ 1300 that was raised . 
 An outgrowth of Jackson 's trip was the realization that the National Park Service does not represent the underlying issue of slavery <unk> in its battlefield displays and presentations . Instead of presenting the battles as political and moral issues , Jackson felt racial context and relevance needed to be presented in a more forward way . As a result , in 2000 , he <unk> the United States Department of the Interior 's appropriation to include a directive to have United States Secretary of the Interior Bruce <unk> use his influence over the <unk> of the national parks to encourage greater inclusion of slavery and social issues in Civil War presentations . 
 Typhoon <unk> was a large and strong tropical cyclone that impacted central Japan in July 2015 . <unk> started its long @-@ living journey as a tropical disturbance over the Marshall Islands and west of the International Dateline , becoming the eleventh named storm of the annual typhoon season on July 3 . It quickly intensified while moving to the west @-@ northwest , attaining typhoon status on July 6 . <unk> moved through the Northern <unk> Islands , passing directly over the uninhabited island of <unk> . Shortly thereafter , the typhoon attained peak winds ; the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) estimated 10 ‑ minute sustained winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) , while the unofficial Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) estimated 1 ‑ minute winds of 250 km / h ( 155 mph ) , making it a super typhoon . <unk> later weakened as it curved to the north , moving across central Japan on July 16 as a minimal typhoon . The storm weakened soon after , dissipating in the Sea of Japan on July 18 . 
 The storm first affected the Marshall Islands , bringing strong winds to the capital <unk> . Half of the city lost power , and several boats were sunk . <unk> effects were reported in the Northern <unk> Islands , and later the storm 's flow enhanced the monsoon over the Philippines . Effects were worst in Japan , where rainfall reached 740 mm ( 29 in ) in <unk> , <unk> Prefecture . Total damage across the <unk> region reached ¥ 18 billion ( US $ 150 million ) . <unk> killed two people in Japan , injured 55 , and damaged or flooded 220 houses . 
 A <unk> wind burst spawned Typhoon Chan @-@ <unk> and Tropical Storm <unk> across the western Pacific Ocean , as well as the system that would become Typhoon <unk> . On July 1 , an area of <unk> convection persisted east of the Marshall Islands , associated with a poorly @-@ defined circulation . Low wind shear , water sea surface temperatures , and good outflow favored further development . The circulation gradually became more defined as the convection organized more . At 18 : 00 UTC on July 2 , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) classified the system as a tropical depression , about 80 km ( 50 mi ) east of <unk> Atoll . Based on the increasing organization , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) classified the system as Tropical Depression <unk> at 12 : 00 UTC on July 3 . About six hours later , the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm <unk> . 
 When <unk> was upgraded to a tropical storm by the JTWC early on July 4 , convective bands were wrapping into the center , but limited by dry air to the west . By that time , the storm was moving to the west @-@ northwest , steered by the subtropical ridge to the north . On July 5 , the JMA upgraded the storm to a severe tropical storm . By that time , the circulation had become exposed due to moderate wind shear , although the outflow had improved . On July 6 after shear diminished , <unk> began to quickly intensify as it developed an eye in the center of the <unk> convection . As a result , the JTWC upgraded the storm to typhoon status at 06 : 00 UTC , followed by the JMA at 12 : 00 UTC . <unk> reached its first peak intensity at 12 : 00 UTC on July 7 , when JMA estimated 10 minute sustained winds 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) . The typhoon was aided by excellent radial outflow enhanced by a <unk> cell to the northwest , and it developed a well @-@ defined eye 48 km ( 30 mi ) in diameter . 
 After its first peak in intensity , <unk> slightly weakened as convection along the west side of the system was restricted due to the <unk> cell , and the eye became cloud @-@ filled . <unk> wind shear and increasing sea surface temperatures allowed the intensification trend to resume , and the structure became more <unk> late on July 8 as it moved toward the Northern <unk> Islands . A well @-@ defined inner eye re @-@ developed inside of an outer eyewall . On July 9 , the JTWC upgraded <unk> to a super typhoon , estimating peak 1 minute winds of 250 km / h ( 155 mph ) . The JMA also assessed a 10 minute peak of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) . At 06 : 00 UTC on July 9 , the eye of <unk> passed over the uninhabited island of <unk> . The typhoon later weakened while turning more to the west due to increased wind shear . The eye became cloud @-@ filled and was no longer visible by July 11 , although the organization was sustained by good outflow to the south . However , the convection reorganized the next day and the eye reformed . By that time , <unk> was slowing and nearly stationary as the subtropical ridge <unk> to the east . 
 Ahead of the storm , the Guam National Weather Service issued a typhoon watch for <unk> , Pagan , and <unk> , as well as a high surf advisory for Guam . The watch was later upgraded to a warning , and was canceled after the typhoon exited the region . <unk> were delayed or canceled to the region due to the storm and problems with the local aircraft communication system . During the storm , there were minor power outages on <unk> in two villages that were quickly restored . On <unk> where the storm struck , six people <unk> out the storm in a concrete bunker . 
 In the Philippines , the flow from the storm increased the southwest monsoon , causing flash floods and landslides in some areas . The outskirts of the storm later brushed the east coast of South Korea , producing 26 mm ( 1 @.@ 0 in ) in rainfall , and wind gusts of 93 km / h ( 58 mph ) . 
 Due to the threat of the storm , nine airlines canceled <unk> flights across Japan . Meanwhile , rail service and highways were disrupted , with a portion of the <unk> Expressway closed , and ferry rides were canceled . The <unk> Railway Company canceled service during the storm and limited rides along the West Japan Railway Company . About 860 @,@ 000 people were advised or ordered to evacuate their homes , including 88 @,@ 100 people from 15 @,@ 400 homes who were forced to leave . After the storm passed , residents were allowed to return home . 
 The River <unk> flows from <unk> in Hampshire , England , to <unk> in West Sussex , where it joins the River <unk> . The upper river , from its source to <unk> , has been used to power <unk> , with the earliest recorded use being in 1086 , when the <unk> survey was conducted . Although none are still operational , many of the buildings which housed the mills still exist , and in some cases , still retain their <unk> machinery . This upper section is also noted for a number of early bridges , which have survived since their construction in the fifteenth , sixteenth and seventeenth centuries . 
 The lower river , from <unk> to its junction with the River <unk> , has been used for navigation . Boats used the section from the <unk> to <unk> following improvements made to the <unk> in 1615 , and after the <unk> Navigation was completed in 1790 , the Earl of <unk> made the river navigable up to <unk> by constructing eight locks and some small cuts . The work was completed in 1794 , and many of the bridges built at that time still survive . With the opening of the Mid @-@ Sussex Railway branch to <unk> in 1859 , traffic declined , and commercial use of the river had ceased by the 1880s . Pleasure boats continued to be used on the river for many years , and published accounts of journeys along the decaying navigation appeared in 1914 and 1920 . The navigation was officially abandoned in 1936 , after an undergraduate pointed out that it was still a public right of way . 
 The river flows through the South Downs National Park , and is a designated Site of Nature Conservation Importance , in recognition of its value for wildlife . It supports a wide range of fish , and its upper reaches are the only location in Sussex where native white <unk> <unk> can be found . The quality of the water is generally good , and the river is measured at four <unk> stations , three on the main channel , and one of the River <unk> , just before its junction with the <unk> . Water from the underlying Lower <unk> <unk> and the adjacent chalk <unk> helps to maintain the flows during the summer months , despite the fact that large volumes are <unk> from both the <unk> and the river for the public water supply . 
 The river 's lower section , below <unk> , was made navigable by the construction of the Western <unk> Navigation in 1794 . The length of the navigation was 11 @.@ 25 miles ( 18 @.@ 11 km ) of which less than 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) consisted of new cuts , with the rest following the existing channel . It rose through 54 feet ( 16 m ) from <unk> to <unk> by a series of eight locks , and cost £ 13 @,@ 300 to build . Traffic consisted of coal transported up @-@ river , with cargoes of timber , corn and <unk> marble in the other direction . A branch connected it to <unk> by the short <unk> Canal , which was 1 @.@ 25 miles ( 2 @.@ 0 km ) long with two locks , and terminated at <unk> to the south of the town . It was opened in 1793 , having cost the Earl £ 5 @,@ 000 to build , but only lasted for a few years , until a turnpike road was diverted . This made access to <unk> easier , and the canal ceased to be used . 
 Unlike many canals , where <unk> were brought into the neighbourhood to carry out the work , the Earl employed local men on the project , most of them already employed by him , and a clergyman praised him for this when writing in 1808 , as it led to much less disruption , but provided increased income for those who worked on the scheme . <unk> rose from 8 or 9 <unk> ( 40 @-@ <unk> ) per week to 14 or 15 <unk> ( 70 @-@ <unk> ) . During his life , the Earl invested some £ 100 @,@ 000 in waterways , some in his native county of Sussex , but also in attempts to build a canal from London to Portsmouth . Between 1802 and 1831 , the average income from the canal was around £ 550 per year . Competition arrived in 1859 , when the Mid @-@ Sussex Railway opened a line from <unk> through <unk> to <unk> . Traffic declined , and by the 1880s , the navigation was no longer used by commercial boats , although it was not officially abandoned until 1936 . 
 The river takes its name from <unk> , not the other way round . <unk> is derived from the Anglo @-@ Saxon <unk> , meaning cattle bridge , which was also the name of the Saxon Hundred or administrative group of parishes . Before this the river was known as the <unk> . 
 The route description has been split into two sections . From its source to <unk> , the river has powered several mills , but has never been navigable . Below <unk> , it was navigable until the navigation closed in the 1880s . There were eight locks on this section , some of which bypassed additional water mills . 
 After another loop to the north , the river passes between <unk> to the north east and <unk> to the south west . The bridge which carries the <unk> road has two wide arches , and was of ashlar construction . Although this structure is still in situ , it is difficult to see , as a pedestrian bridge has been built on the north west side , attached to the original bridge by <unk> , and one of the two arches was widened in 1912 by the addition of another arch outside it . Below the bridge is the mill house and adjoining water mill of North Mill . The mill carries the date 1840 , and the house is of a similar age , although built in two stages . The river flows briefly to the south , passing <unk> on the east bank , which is a scheduled ancient monument . It consists of a medieval fortified house , which is partly ruined , although some of it has been reused . It is situated within <unk> Park , a grade II * listed <unk> park , which forms the grounds for <unk> House , a nineteenth @-@ century mansion some 0 @.@ 75 miles ( 1 @.@ 2 km ) further east . On the opposite bank is a <unk> @-@ and @-@ <unk> castle , dating from the twelfth century . Below this point , the river was navigable . 
 <unk> Lock was another where the lock cut was built across a large <unk> to the north . The bridge at the tail of the lock is built from red and grey brick , and has a single , round @-@ headed arch . It dates from the construction of the navigation , and is virtually unaltered . Nearby , the <unk> Canal headed northwards to <unk> Bridge . Below the end of the cut , the river is joined by the stream from Burton Mill Pond , which supplied an iron forge built in 1789 . It is crossed by <unk> Bridge , built in the nineteenth century from red brick with grey <unk> and a parapet in stone , with three segmental arches . At Lower <unk> , there is another mill building , although it is unused and in poor condition . It was built in 1628 and enlarged in 1742 . It stands in the grounds of the mill house , which was rebuilt in 1913 . The lock cut ran along the south @-@ western edge of the site . <unk> Bridge consists of a southern section , originally built in the sixteenth century , which was rebuilt between 1717 and <unk> , and modified when the navigation was built , to enable boats to pass through the centre arch . A north section , adjacent to the <unk> , dates from 1811 @-@ 12 . 
 Near its junction with the River <unk> , the river loops to the south in a large <unk> . A cut ran from the start of the <unk> to join the <unk> above the original junction , with a lock towards the downstream end . The <unk> fed <unk> Corn Mill . A lock bypassed the mill and the <unk> , to enable boats to reach the <unk> Tunnel cut , which headed south from a junction above the mill . The Tunnel Branch was destroyed by the construction of a water treatment works , and the modern weir near the mouth is much closer to the junction than the lock was . 
 The <unk> & <unk> Rivers Trust ( <unk> ) was set up in 2011 with the objective of enhancing and protecting the river and other connected waterways . It is a charity with further objectives concerning education , fisheries , biodiversity , access and pollution . The organisation is registered as a limited company , and has been asked to produce a <unk> Management plan by the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs . It is working with the <unk> and <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) Partnership and the South Downs National Park Authority to ensure that local opinion is adequately represented in the document . 
 " I Hear You , I See You " is the second season premiere of the American comedy @-@ drama television series <unk> , and the fourteenth overall episode of the series . It originally aired on NBC in the United States on September 14 , 2010 . In the episode , Sarah feels Adam has stolen one of her ideas , Julia and Joel try to talk to their daughter about sex , and Crosby tries to cope with missing Jasmine and Jabbar . 
 The episode was written by Jason <unk> and directed by Lawrence <unk> , and featured the first of several appearances by William Baldwin as Adam 's boss , Gordon Flint . <unk> Kelly , who previously appeared in the first season , also returned to her recurring role as <unk> , Max 's therapist . " I Hear You , I See You " received generally positive reviews . According to Nielsen Media Research , it was seen by an average 7 @.@ 69 million viewers , a decline from the first season premiere in March 2010 . 
 Adam ( Peter <unk> ) is stressed about work because his boss Gordon ( William Baldwin ) feels he is too distracted by family issues . Sarah ( Lauren Graham ) , frustrated with her children for losing their shoes , off @-@ <unk> remarks to Adam about her desire for a <unk> to help locate missing shoes . Put on the spot for new ideas at work , Adam pitches the <unk> idea and Gordon loves it , insisting Adam start developing it . When Sarah learns this later she is excited , but feels upset she is not given credit . When <unk> ( Craig T. Nelson ) encouraged her to stand up for herself , Sarah confronts Adam , but claims he has made many sacrifices for Sarah in the past and never asked for anything in return . Later , however , Adam tells Gordon it was Sarah 's idea . That night , Adam apologizes to Sarah and offers her an internship at the company 's design department , which she happily accepts . 
 In its original American broadcast , " I Hear You , I See You " was seen by an estimated average 7 @.@ 69 million viewers , according to Nielsen Media Research , with 8 @.@ 45 million viewers during the first half hour . The second half hour 's viewership was 6 @.@ 93 million , which was considered a major mid @-@ episode drop . It received a 2 @.@ 7 rating among adults between age 18 and 49 , an eight percent viewership drop compared to the first season premiere on March 2 , 2010 . This was despite a boost <unk> was expected as a result of debuting after the season finale of NBC 's America 's Got Talent . The episode received generally positive reviews . Entertainment Weekly television writer Ken Tucker praised Jason <unk> ' script and felt the episode gave all the actors adequate screen @-@ time while contributing to the overall shape of the series . Tucker particularly praised the new link formed between Sarah and Adam , the infusion of comic relief into Julia and Joel , and Sarah <unk> , who he said gave " the best acting of the night " as <unk> . 
 William Blake drew and painted illustrations for John Milton 's <unk> ode On the Morning of Christ 's <unk> between 1803 and 1815 . A total of 16 illustrations are extant : two sets of six <unk> each , and an additional four drawings in pencil . 
 The dating of the sets is unknown , as is Blake 's intended sequence for the illustrations . The two sets of <unk> are known as the " <unk> set " and the " Thomas set " , after their respective patrons , or as the " Huntington set " and the " Whitworth set " after the Huntington Library and the Whitworth Art Gallery , which now hold the sets in their collections . 
 There is little record of the <unk> of the Thomas set or the <unk> set before 1852 and 1872 , which has led to disputes about the dating . What is known is that the " Thomas set " was commissioned by the Reverend Joseph Thomas , who had also commissioned illustrations to Milton 's <unk> and Paradise Lost from Blake . No contract for the commission is extant , but the commissioning probably took place in 1809 , which is the year in which the illustrations were completed . Blake was eager to accept the commission , according to G. E. Bentley , because " Milton illustrations were a kind of work which Blake could not resist . " They presumably stayed in the <unk> Thomas 's family until they were bought at <unk> 's from an anonymous seller in 1872 . By 1876 they were in the collection of <unk> Taylor , who gave them to the Whitworth in 1892 . 
 Even less is known about the dates of composition for the " <unk> set " - between 1811 and 1820 , Blake created at least thirty three designs for Thomas <unk> , which included the illustrations of " On the Morning of Christ 's <unk> " . Later , they passed from <unk> to his son , who sold them at <unk> 's in 1852 , passed through several more hands , were sold at Christie 's in 1912 , and in 1916 were sold to Henry Huntington . 
 The illustrations themselves do not make the dating any <unk> the edges of the " Thomas set " were trimmed before sale at <unk> 's , leaving " 18 " or " 180 " on most of the sheets . Only The Night of Peace bears the full date of 1809 . The <unk> set is entirely <unk> dates from 1803 to 1817 have been proposed for it . <unk> argues that the <unk> set predates the Thomas set by six years , and Collins Baker and <unk> <unk> place it in 1809 , but earlier than the Thomas set . 
 The sequence of the illustrations is also a topic of scholarly dispute : the mountings of the Thomas set were inscribed on their backs with numbers 1 @-@ 6 , but these were added during or after the 1872 <unk> 's sale , and so are unlikely to follow Blake 's intended order . This " original " order ran thus : 
 Geoffrey Keynes placed them in 1 @-@ 6 @-@ 2 @-@ 3 @-@ 4 @-@ 5 order , so that The Night of Peace followed The <unk> of Peace , because of their similar subjects . <unk> , and nearly all subsequent scholars , have rejected this , as much commentary has centered upon Blake 's use of similar images to frame the sequence . <unk> instead <unk> the " original " sequence as 1 @-@ 2 @-@ 4 @-@ 5 @-@ 3 @-@ 6 , moving The Flight of <unk> to second to last , so that it matches the order of corresponding verses in Milton 's poem . Dunbar also follows <unk> 's order . <unk> adopts a 1 @-@ 2 @-@ 5 @-@ 3 @-@ 4 @-@ 6 order , seeing a thematic progression from the destruction of classical aesthetics , to the old testament cruelty of <unk> ( who resembles Blake 's <unk> ) , to Satan himself . This order is followed by Werner in her Blake 's Vision of the Poetry of Milton . 
 Blake 's literary debt to Milton is key to understanding his illustrations of the earlier poet 's writings . In general , Milton : a Poem is a guide to Blake 's idea of Milton : that he possessed true spiritual vision , but fell by his adherence to the <unk> and repressive tenets of <unk> and by his preference for the cruel and distant <unk> of the Old testament over the <unk> figure of Christ . In that regard the <unk> Ode is to Blake the <unk> of Milton 's poetry into the creative imagination of Christ . Blake also sees a return to <unk> , Christian ideals of poetry , rather than the " pagan " classical aesthetic represented in The <unk> of Apollo and the Pagan Gods by the figure of Apollo , who is modeled on the Apollo <unk> . 
 The illustrations emphasize the simultaneous occurrence of the events they depict by the presence of the stable in almost every image , and by framing the set with two very similar images that focus on the peaceful victory of Christ over darkness . The <unk> of Peace also has neo @-@ <unk> <unk> it represents the descent of the soul into the body , which is symbolized by the cramped stable . 
 L <unk> 's expedition was a French naval operation launched in 1805 during the Napoleonic Wars . The operation was intended as both a commerce raiding operation against the British trading posts of West Africa and as a diversion to the Trafalgar campaign . <unk> from <unk> in October 1805 with one ship of the line , two frigates and a <unk> , Commodore Jean @-@ <unk> @-@ Adrien L <unk> was under orders to intercept and destroy British traders and slave ships off the West African coast and await reinforcements under Jérôme Bonaparte which were to be used in the invasion and capture of one of the British trading forts for use as a permanent French naval base from which further raiding operations could be conducted . It was also hoped by the French naval command that L <unk> might draw some of the large British fleet maintained off <unk> away from the blockade to allow the French and Spanish allied fleet trapped in the harbour to escape . 
 By the summer of 1806 , the Napoleonic Wars were two years old and the first major campaign at sea , the Trafalgar campaign , was nearing its climax . A French fleet had departed Toulon in March 1805 under Vice @-@ Admiral Pierre @-@ Charles <unk> , gathered Spanish ships from the Spanish Mediterranean ports and then crossed the Atlantic , under orders to disrupt British trade in the region and seize British colonies . <unk> pursuing the Allied fleet was an equivalent British Royal Navy force under Vice @-@ Admiral Lord Nelson , which reached the Caribbean on 11 June and found that <unk> had already begun the return journey to Europe . On 22 July 1805 the Allied fleet had fought the Battle of Cape <unk> against a British force under Sir Robert Calder and been forced to divert south , seeking shelter in the Spanish fleet anchorage of <unk> . Appearing off <unk> a few days after <unk> 's arrival , Nelson began a blockade of the Allied fleet , awaiting their emergence and preparing for battle . 
 L <unk> 's squadron sailed from <unk> on 31 October , avoiding contact with the British blockading squadron and heading for the West African coast . Although the news had not yet reached Brittany , <unk> 's fleet had already been destroyed at the Battle of Trafalgar ten days earlier and L <unk> 's role as a diversion to the main campaign was no longer required . <unk> in the Gulf of Guinea during November and December , L <unk> succeeded in capturing and burning a number of small merchant vessels and slave ships . The intended reinforcements never appeared however — in the aftermath of Trafalgar Napoleon diverted resources to the Atlantic campaign of 1806 , a major raiding operation to the Caribbean and South Atlantic launched in December 1805 . Among the vessels detailed for this operation was Jérôme Bonaparte 's ship <unk> , which cruised as part of the squadron under Vice @-@ Admiral Jean @-@ Baptiste <unk> . 
 L <unk> 's three other ships all survived the hurricane relatively intact and were able to continue their journey to Europe unimpeded , the British squadrons in the area also dispersed by the summer storms . In late September the squadron broke up , <unk> sailing for Brest and arriving on 5 October , the only French ship of the line to enter or leave the port all year . <unk> was less successful : at 03 : 30 on 27 September , while sailing in the Bay of Biscay at 47 ° 17 ′ N 06 ° 52 ′ W , Captain <unk> sighted six ships of the line . This overwhelming force was a squadron under Rear @-@ Admiral Sir Thomas Louis , which had been sent to the Bay of Biscay to await the return of <unk> from the Caribbean . Immediately giving chase , Louis found that his ships of the line were not fast enough to catch the French frigate , which began to <unk> the main body of the squadron . However one of the small 18 @-@ gun <unk> attached to the squadron , HMS <unk> under Captain Edward Hawkins was able to keep pace with the frigate , coming within firing range at 18 : 45 . 
 Although Hawkins only had two small guns that would bear on the frigate he kept up a steady rate of fire during the next hour , avoiding fire from the frigate 's bow guns during the chase . By 19 : 45 it was obvious that <unk> 's fire was successfully delaying the frigate and <unk> turned towards the approaching squadron , moving as if to attack the nearest British frigate HMS Blanche under Sir Thomas <unk> . Seeing the French ship change direction , Louis ordered his flagship HMS Canopus to fire a gun at extreme range . This alerted <unk> to the rapidly approaching squadron and he decided to surrender rather than be destroyed by the combined firepower of the British ships . No man had been hurt in the exchange of fire but <unk> had suffered severe damage to her rigging and one shot through her hull . The French ship had suffered minor damage in the engagement and was subsequently taken into the Royal Navy as HMS <unk> , renamed in 1815 to HMS <unk> . The frigate was much admired in the Royal Navy and a number of later frigates were built to a similar design . 
 Biblical Hebrew eventually developed into <unk> Hebrew , which was spoken until the second century CE . 
 Biblical Hebrew is best @-@ attested in the Hebrew Bible , the collection of <unk> religious and historical texts which reflect various stages of the Hebrew language in its <unk> skeleton , as well as a <unk> system which was added in the Middle Ages by the <unk> . There is also some evidence of regional <unk> variation , including differences between Biblical Hebrew as spoken in the northern Kingdom of Israel and in the southern Kingdom of Judah . 
 The term Classical Hebrew may include all pre @-@ medieval dialects of Hebrew , including <unk> Hebrew , or it may be limited to Hebrew contemporaneous with the Hebrew Bible . The term Biblical Hebrew refers to pre @-@ <unk> dialects ( sometimes excluding Dead Sea <unk> Hebrew ) . The term ' Biblical Hebrew ' may or may not include extra @-@ biblical texts , such as inscriptions ( e.g. the <unk> inscription ) , and generally also includes later vocalization traditions for the Hebrew Bible 's <unk> text , most commonly the early medieval <unk> vocalization . 
 The archeological record for the prehistory of Biblical Hebrew is far more complete than the record of Biblical Hebrew itself . Early Northwest Semitic ( <unk> ) materials are attested from <unk> BCE to 1200 BCE , the end of the Bronze Age . The Northwest Semitic languages , including Hebrew , differentiated noticeably during the Iron Age ( 1200 – 540 BCE ) , although in its earliest stages Biblical Hebrew was not highly differentiated from <unk> and the Canaanite of the <unk> letters . 
 Hebrew developed during the latter half of the second millennium BCE between the Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea , an area known as Canaan . The <unk> tribes established a kingdom in Canaan at the beginning of the first millennium BCE , which later split into the kingdom of Israel in the north and the kingdom of Judah in the south after a dispute of succession . The earliest Hebrew writing yet discovered was found at <unk> <unk> and dates to the 10th century BCE . 
 The kingdom of Israel was destroyed by the Assyrians in <unk> BCE . The kingdom of Judah was conquered by the <unk> in <unk> BCE , its higher classes were exiled into the Babylonian captivity and Solomon 's Temple was destroyed . Later the Persians made Judah a province and permitted Jewish exiles to return and rebuild the Temple . According to the <unk> , Hebrew of this period was similar to Imperial Aramaic ; in <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> bar Hama said that God sent the exiled Jews to Babylon because " [ the Babylonian ] language is akin to the <unk> <unk> " . 
 Aramaic became the common language in the north , in Galilee and <unk> . Hebrew remained in use in Judah ; however the returning exiles brought back Aramaic influence , and Aramaic was used for communicating with other ethnic groups during the Persian period . Alexander conquered Judah in <unk> BCE , beginning the period of Hellenistic ( Greek ) domination . During the Hellenistic period Judea became independent under the <unk> dynasty , but later the Romans ended their independence , making <unk> the Great their governor . One Jewish revolt against the Romans led to the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE , and the second Bar <unk> revolt in 132 – 135 led to a large departure of the Jewish population of Judea . 
 Biblical Hebrew after the Second Temple period evolved into <unk> Hebrew , which ceased being spoken and developed into a literary language around 200 CE . Hebrew continued to be used as a literary and <unk> language in the form of Medieval Hebrew , and Hebrew began a revival process in the 19th century , culminating in Modern Hebrew becoming the official language of Israel . Currently , Classical Hebrew is generally taught in public schools in Israel , and Biblical Hebrew forms are sometimes used in Modern Hebrew literature , much as archaic and biblical constructions are used in Modern English literature . Since Modern Hebrew contains many biblical elements , Biblical Hebrew is fairly <unk> to Modern Hebrew speakers . 
 As Biblical Hebrew evolved from the Proto @-@ Semitic language it underwent a number of <unk> <unk> parallel with those in other Canaanite languages . There is no evidence that these <unk> occurred after the adaptation of the Hebrew alphabet . 
 The Northwest Semitic languages formed a dialect <unk> in the Iron Age ( 1200 – 540 BCE ) , with Phoenician and Aramaic on each extreme . Hebrew is classed with Phoenician in the Canaanite <unk> , which also includes <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> . <unk> might be considered a Hebrew dialect , though it possessed distinctive Aramaic features . Although <unk> shows a large degree of affinity to Hebrew in poetic structure , vocabulary , and some grammar , it lacks some Canaanite features ( like the Canaanite shift and the shift * / <unk> / > / <unk> / ) , and its similarities are more likely a result of either contact or preserved <unk> . 
 Biblical Hebrew as preserved in the Hebrew Bible is composed of multiple linguistic layers . The <unk> skeleton of the text is the most ancient , while the vocalization and <unk> are later additions reflecting a later stage of the language . These additions were added after 600 CE ; Hebrew had already ceased being used as a spoken language around 200 CE . Biblical Hebrew as reflected in the <unk> text of the Bible and in extra @-@ biblical inscriptions may be subdivided by era . 
 Biblical Hebrew from after the Babylonian exile in <unk> BCE is known as ' Late Biblical Hebrew ' . Late Biblical Hebrew shows Aramaic influence in <unk> , morphology , and lexicon , and this trend is also evident in the later @-@ developed <unk> vocalization system . 
 <unk> Hebrew , attested in the Dead Sea <unk> from ca . 200 BCE to 70 CE , is a continuation of Late Biblical Hebrew . <unk> Hebrew may be considered an intermediate stage between Biblical Hebrew and <unk> Hebrew , though <unk> Hebrew shows its own idiosyncratic <unk> features . 
 The earliest Hebrew writing yet discovered , found at <unk> <unk> , dates to the 10th century BCE . The 15 cm x 16 @.@ 5 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in x 6 @.@ 5 in ) <unk> pottery <unk> ( <unk> ) has five lines of text written in ink written in the Proto @-@ Canaanite alphabet ( the old form of the Phoenician alphabet ) . The <unk> is written from left to right , indicating that Hebrew writing was still in the formative stage . 
 At an early stage , in documents written in the <unk> @-@ Hebrew script , words were divided by short vertical lines and later by dots , as reflected by the <unk> Stone , the <unk> inscription , the <unk> inscription , and <unk> @-@ Hebrew script documents from <unk> . Word division was not used in Phoenician inscriptions ; however , there is not direct evidence for biblical texts being written without word division , as suggested by <unk> in his introduction to the Torah . Word division using spaces was commonly used from the beginning of the 7th century BCE for documents in the Aramaic script . In addition to marking vowels , the <unk> system also uses <unk> marks , which serve to mark word stress , semantic structure , and the musical motifs used in formal recitation of the text . 
 The phonetic nature of some Biblical Hebrew consonants is disputed . The so @-@ called " <unk> " were likely <unk> , but possibly <unk> or <unk> . Some argue that / s , <unk> , <unk> / were <unk> ( / <unk> , <unk> , <unk> / ) . 
 This is observed by noting that these <unk> are distinguished consistently in the <unk> of the <unk> ( e.g. Isaac <unk> 
 <unk> ) , but this becomes more sporadic in later books and is generally absent in Ezra and <unk> . 
 The vowel system of Biblical Hebrew has changed considerably over time . The following vowels are those reconstructed for the earliest stage of Hebrew , those attested by the <unk> , those of the various vocalization traditions ( <unk> and varieties of Babylonian and Palestinian ) , and those of the <unk> tradition , with vowels absent in some traditions color @-@ coded . 
 The following sections present the vowel changes that Biblical Hebrew underwent , in approximate chronological order . 
 Proto @-@ Semitic is the ancestral language of all the Semitic languages , and in traditional reconstructions possessed 29 consonants ; 6 <unk> vowels , consisting of three qualities and two lengths , * / a <unk> i <unk> u <unk> / , in which the long vowels occurred only in open syllables ; and two <unk> * / <unk> <unk> / . The stress system of Proto @-@ Semitic is unknown but it is commonly described as being much like the system of Classical Latin or the modern pronunciation of Classical Arabic : If the penultimate ( second last ) syllable is light ( has a short vowel followed by a single <unk> ) , stress goes on the <unk> ( third last ) ; otherwise , it goes on the penultimate . 
 Various changes , mostly in morphology , took place between Proto @-@ Semitic and Proto @-@ Central @-@ Semitic , the language at the root of the Central Semitic languages . The <unk> system was inherited essentially unchanged , but the <unk> consonants may have changed their realization in Central Semitic from <unk> to <unk> consonants . 
 <unk> <unk> at this point ended in a <unk> / <unk> / or / <unk> / and took normal case endings . ( When the ending / <unk> / became final because of loss or non @-@ presence of the case ending , both Hebrew and Arabic show a later shift to / <unk> / and then / <unk> / . ) 
 Hebrew shows the Canaanite shift whereby * / <unk> / often shifted to / <unk> / ; the conditions of this shift are disputed . This shift had occurred by the 14th century BCE , as demonstrated by its presence in the <unk> letters ( c . <unk> BCE ) . 
 As a result of the Canaanite shift , the Proto @-@ Hebrew vowel system is reconstructed as * / a <unk> <unk> i <unk> u <unk> / ( and possibly rare * / <unk> / ) . Furthermore , stress at this point appears to have shifted so that it was consistently on the penultimate ( next to last ) syllable , and was still non @-@ <unk> . The predominant final stress of Biblical Hebrew was a result of loss of final <unk> vowels and a shift away from remaining open syllables ( see below ) . 
 Final <unk> short vowels dropped out in most words , making it possible for long vowels to occur in closed syllables . This appears to have proceeded in two steps : 
 <unk> <unk> in stressed , open syllables occurred between the two steps , with the result that short vowels at the beginning of a <unk> ending lengthened in <unk> but not <unk> . This is most noticeable with short / a / : e.g. * <unk> ( ' he wrote ' ) > / <unk> / but * <unk> ( ' word ' <unk> . ' ) > / <unk> / . 
 The dropping of final short vowels in verb forms tended to erase mood distinctions , but also some gender distinctions ; however , unexpected vowel <unk> occurred in many situations to preserve the distinctions . For example , in the <unk> <unk> , first @-@ singular * <unk> appears to have been remade into * <unk> already by Proto @-@ Hebrew on the basis of possessive <unk> ( likewise first singular personal <unk> * <unk> became * <unk> ) . 
 The exact same process affected possessive * <unk> ( ' your ' <unk> sing . ) and * <unk> ( ' your ' <unk> sing . ) , and personal <unk> * <unk> , * <unk> , with the same split into shorter and longer forms and the same ultimate resolution . 
 First , short vowels lengthened in an open syllable in <unk> position ( i.e. directly before the stressed syllable ) . 
 In the process of <unk> , the high vowels were lowered . In the <unk> , the lengthened <unk> of / a i u / are / <unk> <unk> <unk> / ; when kept short they generally have <unk> / a e o / . 
 <unk> open syllables with a short vowel ( i.e. syllables consisting of a short vowel followed by a <unk> and another vowel ) had the vowel reduced to / <unk> / and the stressed moved one syllable later in the word ( usually to the last syllable of the word ) . <unk> was originally penultimate and loss of final short vowels made many words have final stress . However , words whose final syllable had a long vowel or ended with a <unk> were unaffected and still had penultimate stress at this point . This change did not happen in <unk> position , where the penultimate stress is preserved , and vowel <unk> rather than reduction occurs . 
 Loss of final short vowels in <unk> , pre @-@ stress <unk> in open syllables . Pre @-@ stress <unk> / lowering becomes a surface filter that remains as a rule in the language , automatically affected any new short vowels in open syllables as they appear ( but ultra @-@ short vowels are unaffected ) . 
 <unk> movement from light syllable to following heavy syllable when not in <unk> , with newly <unk> light syllable reducing the <unk> . 
 Note that many , perhaps most , Hebrew words with a <unk> directly before a final stress are due to this stress shift . 
 This sound change shifted many more originally penultimate @-@ stressed words to have final stress . The above changes can be seen to divide words into a number of main classes based on stress and syllable properties : 
 Proto @-@ Hebrew words with an open <unk> and short @-@ vowel ending : <unk> final @-@ stressed ( e.g. / <unk> / ( ' he killed ' ) < <unk> . / <unk> / ) . 
 Proto @-@ Hebrew words with an closed <unk> and short @-@ vowel ending : <unk> penultimate due to <unk> rule ( e.g. / <unk> / ( ' king ' ) < * / <unk> / ) . 
 Proto @-@ Hebrew words with an open short <unk> and longer ending : <unk> final @-@ stressed due to <unk> shift ( e.g. / <unk> / ( ' they killed ' ) < <unk> . / <unk> / ) . 
 Proto @-@ Hebrew words with a closed <unk> and longer ending : <unk> penultimate ( e.g. / <unk> / ( ' I killed ' ) < <unk> . / <unk> / ) . 
 The following charts <unk> the most common <unk> of the Proto @-@ Semitic vowels in the various stages of Hebrew : 
 <unk> ( <unk> 49 : 14 ) . This may reflect <unk> variation or phonetic versus <unk> <unk> . Both the Palestinian and Babylonian traditions have an <unk> vowel in <unk> , / e / in the Palestinian tradition ( e.g. / <unk> / ' <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> Jeremiah 22 : 28 ) . The <unk> tradition sometimes shows some type of back <unk> vowel when the first vowel is back , e.g. 〈 <unk> 〉 for <unk> 〈 <unk> 〉 / <unk> / ( ' tent ' ) . 
 Biblical Hebrew has two sets of personal <unk> : the free @-@ standing independent <unk> have a <unk> function , while the <unk> <unk> are genitive or <unk> . Only the first person <unk> has different possessive and objective forms ( <unk> and <unk> ) . 
 The following is a sample from <unk> 18 as appears in the <unk> text with medieval <unk> <unk> and <unk> and the Greek transcription of the <unk> of the <unk> along with its reconstructed pronunciation . 
 <unk> went by many names ; he was listed as Georg Karl <unk> on his German marriage certificate . He was listed as Carl <unk> von <unk> on his United States citizenship papers , and he was listed as Carl <unk> on his Florida death certificate . Some of his hospital records were signed Count Carl <unk> von <unk> . 
 He was born as Karl <unk> or Georg Karl <unk> on February 8 , 1877 in Dresden , Germany . Around 1920 he married Doris Anna <unk> ( 1889 – 1977 ) and he was listed as " Georg Karl <unk> " on the marriage certificate . Together they had two children : Ayesha <unk> ( 1922 – 1998 ) , and Crystal <unk> ( 1924 – 1934 ) , who died of <unk> . 
 <unk> grew up in Germany . The following “ <unk> Note “ accompanying the autobiographical account “ The Trial Bay Organ : A Product of <unk> and <unk> ” by “ Carl von <unk> , “ in the <unk> <unk> of March and April 1939 , gives details about his stay in Australia before and during World War I and his return to Germany after the war : 
 Many years ago , Carl von <unk> travelled from India to Australia with the intention of proceeding to the South Seas Islands . He paused in Australia to collect equipment and suitable boats , and to become acquainted with prevailing weather and sea conditions . However , he became interested in engineering and electrical work there , bought property , boats , an organ , an island in the Pacific — so that he was still in Australia at the end of ten years . He had just begun to build a trans @-@ ocean flyer when the war broke out and the British military authorities placed him in a concentration camp for ' safe @-@ keeping ' along with many officers India and China who were prisoners of war . Later he was removed to Trial Bay to a castle @-@ like prison on the cliffs , and there the work in this narrative was accomplished . At the end of the war no prisoner was permitted to return to his former residence , but all were shipped to the prisoner 's exchange in Holland . When Carl von <unk> was released he set out to find his mother from whom he had not heard since the beginning of the war . Finding her safe , he remained with her for three years , witnessing the chaos that followed in the wake of the war . ... Finally , she suggested that her son return to his sister in the United States ... 
 <unk> 's account of Trial Bay <unk> , his secret building of a sailing boat , etc . , is confirmed by <unk> <unk> , who mentions that he planned to escape from the <unk> with ” Count Carl von <unk> ” in a sailing boat , and provides other information about the interment of Germans in Australia during <unk> . 
 <unk> emigrated to the United States in 1926 , sailing from Rotterdam on February 6 , 1926 to Havana , Cuba . From Cuba he settled in <unk> , Florida , to where his sister had already emigrated , and was later joined by his wife and two daughters . Leaving his family behind in <unk> in 1927 , he took a job as a <unk> <unk> at the U.S. Marine Hospital in Key West , Florida under the name Carl von <unk> . 
 During his childhood in Germany , and later while traveling briefly in Genoa , Italy , <unk> claimed to have been visited by visions of a dead ancestor , Countess Anna <unk> von <unk> , who revealed the face of his true love , an exotic dark @-@ haired woman , to him . 
 On April 22 , 1930 , while working at the Marine Hospital in Key West , <unk> met Maria <unk> " Helen " <unk> de <unk> ( 1909 – 1931 ) , a local Cuban @-@ American woman who had been brought to the hospital by her mother for an examination . <unk> immediately recognized her as the beautiful dark @-@ haired woman that had been revealed to him in his earlier " visions . " By all accounts , <unk> was viewed as a local beauty in Key West . 
 On February 18 , 1926 , <unk> married Luis Mesa ( 1908 – ? ) , the son of <unk> and Isaac Mesa . Luis left <unk> shortly after <unk> <unk> the couple 's child , and moved to Miami . <unk> was legally married to Mesa at the time of her death . 
 <unk> was eventually diagnosed with tuberculosis , a typically fatal disease at the time , that eventually claimed the lives of almost all of her entire immediate family . <unk> , with his self @-@ professed medical knowledge , attempted to treat and cure <unk> with a variety of medicines , as well as x @-@ ray and electrical equipment , that were brought to the <unk> ' home . <unk> showered <unk> with gifts of jewelry and clothing , and allegedly professed his love to her , but no evidence has surfaced to show that any of his affection was <unk> by <unk> . 
 Despite <unk> 's best efforts , <unk> died of terminal tuberculosis at her parents ' home in Key West on October 25 , 1931 . <unk> paid for her funeral , and with the permission of her family he then commissioned the construction of an above ground mausoleum in the Key West Cemetery , which he visited almost every night . 
 Shortly after the corpse 's discovery by authorities , <unk> 's body was examined by <unk> and <unk> , and put on public display at the Dean @-@ Lopez <unk> Home , where it was viewed by as many as 6 @,@ 800 people . <unk> 's body was eventually returned to the Key West Cemetery where the remains were buried in an unmarked grave , in a secret location , to prevent further <unk> . 
 The facts underlying the case and the preliminary hearing drew much interest from the media at the time ( most notably , from the Key West Citizen and Miami Herald ) , and created a sensation among the public , both regionally and nationwide . The public mood was generally sympathetic to <unk> , whom many viewed as an eccentric " romantic " . 
 Though not reported <unk> , research ( most notably by authors Harrison and <unk> ) has revealed evidence of <unk> 's necrophilia with <unk> 's corpse . Two <unk> ( Dr. <unk> and Dr. <unk> ) who attended the 1940 autopsy of <unk> 's remains recalled in 1972 that a paper tube had been inserted in the vaginal area of the corpse that allowed for intercourse . Others contend that since no evidence of necrophilia was presented at the 1940 preliminary hearing , and because the <unk> ' " proof " surfaced in 1972 , over 30 years after the case had been dismissed , the necrophilia allegation is questionable . While no existing contemporary photographs of the autopsy or photographs taken at the public display show a tube , the necrophilia claim was repeated by the HBO <unk> program in 2005 . 
 In 1944 , <unk> moved to <unk> County , Florida close to <unk> , Florida , where he wrote an autobiography that appeared in the <unk> publication , Fantastic Adventures , in 1947 . His home was near his wife Doris , who apparently helped to support <unk> in his later years . <unk> received United States citizenship in 1950 in Tampa . 
 <unk> from his obsession , <unk> used a death mask to create a life @-@ sized effigy of <unk> , and lived with it until his death on July 3 , 1952 . His body was discovered on the floor of his home three weeks after his death . He died under the name " Carl <unk> " . 
 It has been recounted that <unk> was found in the arms of the <unk> effigy upon discovery of his corpse , but his obituary reported that he died on the floor behind one of his organs . The obituary recounted : " a metal cylinder on a shelf above a table in it wrapped in <unk> cloth and a robe was a <unk> image " . 
 It has been written ( most notably by <unk> ) that <unk> had the bodies switched ( or that <unk> 's remains were secretly returned to him ) , and that he died with the real body of <unk> . 
 Several bands have released musical interpretations of the <unk> story , such as And You Will Know Us By the Trail of Dead 's The Secret of <unk> 's Tomb album , and Sleep Station 's Von <unk> album , both released in 2003 . 
 In 2010 , the <unk> band <unk> released a song titled Cold Night which is sung from <unk> 's perspective . 
 The band " Through The Strip " released a song called " One Moment In Time ( Carl Von <unk> <unk> ) " Which featured sound clips from documentaries in the intro . The song is told from the points of view of both <unk> and Carl <unk> . 
 In 2008 , <unk> released the single Count Von <unk> <unk> , with the b @-@ side A Cemetery <unk> presenting an instrumental piece <unk> Carl <unk> 's organ playing in the tomb . 
 The Ripley 's Believe It or Not museum In Key West , Florida , has an exhibit <unk> <unk> 's body being cared for by <unk> . 
 <unk> of the original memorial plaque that was commissioned by <unk> and affixed to <unk> <unk> 's mausoleum have been reassembled and are on display at the <unk> Gallery @-@ Key West Art and Historical Museum in Key West . 
 The story of Dr. Von <unk> and <unk> <unk> was featured in an episode Investigation Discovery series " True <unk> " entitled " <unk> Your Welcome " . 
 " It <unk> in Key West " , the musical , co @-@ written by Jill <unk> , Jason <unk> and Jeremiah James , is currently in production for 2017 . < <unk> : / / <unk> / # ! story / <unk> > 
 " You 'll Always Find Your Way Back Home " is a country pop song written for the 2009 film Hannah Montana : The Movie . The song is performed by Hannah Montana , a character Miley Cyrus portrays in the film . A karaoke version of the song is available in the soundtrack 's karaoke series . The song is musically country pop and pop rock . Lyrically , the track is about staying grounded and going back to one 's roots . 
 The song received critical success for its use in the film . " You 'll Always Find Your Way Back Home " was met with average @-@ to @-@ low commercial outcomes for Cyrus in several countries , compared to those of her previous efforts as Montana . It reached its highest international peak in the Canadian Hot 100 , at number thirty @-@ six . The song received a music video to coincide with the home release of Hannah Montana : The Movie . 
 Singer @-@ songwriter Taylor Swift became involved with Hannah Montana : The Movie when filmmakers <unk> her specifically to request the use of her music in the film . Swift agreed to make a cameo appearance in the film to sing " <unk> " as well as to co @-@ write a song with Boys Like Girls lead singer Martin Johnson . In an interview with MTV , Johnson described working with Swift : 
 " She 's awesome . She 's one of the most talented songwriters to work with , if not , the best . For such a young girl , she 's so creative and spot @-@ on . She knows the audience , she truly <unk> the kind of pop music that is from the heart and done in a <unk> way . She knows ways to make things pop and also make you feel it at the same time . We wrote a bunch of songs together and it was a lot of fun . " 
 " You 'll Always Find Your Way Back Home " is used as the closing number of Hannah Montana : The Movie . In the film , Cyrus performs as <unk> Hannah Montana onstage at an outdoor fundraiser to save her hometown 's <unk> park from developers . More than 2 @,@ 000 extras were used to film the scene . 
 " You 'll Always Find Your Way Back Home " , according to Allmusic , embodies the album 's theme of merging country and pop music . It is set in common time with a fast rock tempo of 160 beats per minute . The song is written in the key of E ♭ major . Cyrus ' vocals span one octave , from B ♭ 3 to <unk> . The song has the following chord progression , E ♭ 5 — D5 — E ♭ 5 . Like the film , the lyrics discuss importance of one 's roots . Warren <unk> of About.com believed it conveyed " the sentiment that even pop stars find safe haven in their home town " . The first few lyrics of the song 's chorus are almost identical to the opening verse in <unk> Duff 's song So <unk> , which was released in 2003 . 
 The song received positive reviews from critics . Simon Weaving of <unk> said the film 's conflicts are " mostly expressed in the simple , <unk> lyrics of a series of pop hits that seamlessly find their way into the story – including ' The Best of Both Worlds ' and ' You ’ ll Always Find a Way Back Home ' . " James <unk> of <unk> described the song as being " integrated pretty well into the narrative " . Peter <unk> of <unk> Reviews said " the story makes way for [ ... ] ' You 'll Always Find Your Way Back Home ' " , which would attract " the film 's target audience of pre @-@ teen girls " . Warren of <unk> of About.com listed the song as the third best song by Hannah Montana . The song was included on the short list for Best Original Song at the 82nd Academy Awards . 
 The song made its debut on the Billboard Hot 100 at number eighty @-@ seven on the week ending April 11 , 2009 . " You 'll Always Find Your Way Back Home " fell one spot to number eighty @-@ eight in the following week , but on the week ending May 2 , 2009 it reached its peak on the Hot 100 at number eighty @-@ one due to digital downloads that placed it at number fifty @-@ two on Hot Digital Songs . In the Canadian Hot 100 , " You 'll Always Find Your Way Back Home " debuted at eighty @-@ eight on the week ending April 11 , 2009 and reached its peak at number seventy @-@ six on the week ending May 2 , 2009 . 
 A promotional music video for " You 'll Always Find Your Way Back Home " was filmed in correlation to the Hannah Montana : The Movie soundtrack . The video , part of a series of promotional videos titled The Miley Sessions , was released in March 2009 on <unk> and features Cyrus singing in a vacant recording studio . 
 An excerpt from Hannah Montana : The Movie premiered as the song 's music video in August 2009 on Disney Channel to promote the home release of the film . The video begins with Cyrus and her backup dancers atop a stage in a crowded outdoor concert . Cyrus is dressed as Hannah Montana and is wearing a business suit . As Cyrus begins singing , she and the dancers engage in intricate choreography . The video then transitions to a clip from Hannah Montana : The Movie in which Cyrus ' character is getting down from a private airplane . The video continues to alternate between Cyrus performing and more film clips ; scenes include Stewart taking off her Hannah Montana wig and interacting with Travis Body , her love interest in the film , portrayed by actor Lucas <unk> . Midway through the video , Cyrus and her dancers exit the stage through a back door and instantly enter sporting western clothing with Cyrus in a western <unk> button up shirt , a <unk> red and white table cloth with purple <unk> <unk> or a <unk> , and <unk> boots . 
 Marjory Stoneman Douglas ( April 7 , 1890 – May 14 , 1998 ) was an American journalist , writer , feminist , and <unk> known for her staunch defense of the Everglades against efforts to drain it and reclaim land for development . Moving to Miami as a young woman to work for The Miami Herald , Douglas became a freelance writer , producing over a hundred short stories that were published in popular magazines . Her most influential work was the book The Everglades : River of Grass ( 1947 ) , which <unk> the popular conception of the Everglades as a <unk> river instead of a worthless swamp ; its impact has been compared to that of Rachel Carson 's influential book Silent Spring ( 1962 ) . Her books , stories , and journalism career brought her influence in Miami , which she used to advance her causes . 
 Even as a young woman Douglas was outspoken and politically conscious of many issues that included women 's suffrage and civil rights . She was called upon to take a central role in the protection of the Everglades when she was 79 years old . For the remaining 29 years of her life she was " a <unk> reporter and fearless crusader " for the natural preservation and restoration of the nature of South Florida . Her <unk> efforts earned her several variations of the nickname " Grande Dame of the Everglades " as well as the hostility of agricultural and business interests looking to benefit from land development in Florida . Numerous awards were given to her , including the Presidential Medal of Freedom , and she was inducted into several halls of fame . 
 Douglas lived until age 108 , working until nearly the end of her life for Everglades restoration . Upon her death , an obituary in The Independent in London stated , " In the history of the American environmental movement , there have been few more remarkable figures than Marjory Stoneman Douglas . " 
 Marjory Stoneman was born on April 7 , 1890 , in Minneapolis , Minnesota , the only child of Frank Bryant Stoneman ( 1857 – 1941 ) and <unk> <unk> ( 1859 – 1912 ) , a concert violinist . One of her earliest memories was her father reading to her The Song of <unk> , at which she burst into <unk> upon hearing that the tree had to give its life in order to provide <unk> the wood for a <unk> . She was an early and <unk> reader . Her first book was Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland , which she kept well into adulthood until " some <unk> in human form must have borrowed it and not brought it back " . She visited Florida when she was four years old , and her most vivid memory of the trip was picking an orange from a tree at the Tampa Bay Hotel . From there she and her parents embarked on a cruise from Tampa to Havana . 
 When she was six years old , Marjory 's parents separated . Her father endured a series of failed <unk> ventures and the instability caused her mother to move them abruptly to the <unk> family house in Taunton , Massachusetts . She lived there with her mother , aunt , and grandparents who did not get along well and consistently spoke ill of her father , to her dismay . Her mother , whom Marjory characterized as " high strung " , was committed to a mental <unk> in Providence several times . Her parents ' separation and the contentious life with her mother 's family caused her to suffer from night <unk> . She credited her tenuous upbringing with making her " a <unk> and a <unk> " for the rest of her life . 
 As a youth , Marjory found <unk> in reading , and eventually she began to write . At sixteen years old she contributed to the most popular children 's publication of the day , St. Nicholas Magazine — also the first publisher of 20th century writers F. Scott Fitzgerald , Rachel Carson , and William Faulkner — with a puzzle titled " Double <unk> and <unk> " . In 1907 , she was awarded a prize from the Boston Herald for a story titled " An Early Morning <unk> " , about a boy who watches a <unk> from a <unk> . However , as her mother 's mental health deteriorated , Marjory took on more responsibilities , eventually managing some of the family finances and gaining a maturity imposed upon her by circumstance . 
 Marjory left for college in 1908 , despite having grave <unk> about her mother 's mental state . Her aunt and grandmother shared her concerns , but recognized that she needed to leave in order to begin her own life . She was a good student without having to study too much . She attended <unk> College , graduating with a <unk> in English in 1912 . She found particular gifts in a class on <unk> , and joined the first suffrage club with six of her classmates . She was elected as " Class <unk> " at <unk> , but was unable to fulfill the office since she was already involved in other activities . During her senior year while visiting home , her mother showed her a <unk> on her breast . Marjory arranged the surgery to have it removed . After the graduation ceremony , her aunt informed her it had <unk> , and within months her mother was dead . The family left making the funeral arrangements up to Marjory . 
 After drifting with college friends through a few jobs for which she did not feel she was well @-@ suited , Marjory Stoneman met Kenneth Douglas in 1914 . She was so impressed with his manners and surprised at the attention he showed her that she married him within three months . He portrayed himself as a newspaper editor , and was 30 years her senior , but the marriage quickly failed when it became apparent he was a con artist . The true extent of his duplicity Marjory did not entirely reveal , despite her honesty in all other manners . Marjory may have unwittingly married Douglas while he was already married to another woman . While he spent six months in jail for passing a bad check , she remained faithful to him . However , his scheme to <unk> her absent father out of money worked in Marjory 's favor when it attracted Frank Stoneman 's attention . Marjory 's uncle persuaded her to move to Miami and for the marriage to end . In the fall of 1915 , Marjory Stoneman Douglas left New England to be reunited with her father , whom she had not seen since her parents ' separation when she was six years old . Shortly before that time , her father had remarried <unk> ( " <unk> " ) Eleanor <unk> , whose great @-@ great grandfather was Thomas Jefferson . ( Her grandfather was Francis W. <unk> . ) Marjory later wrote that <unk> <unk> " remained my first and best friend all my life in Florida . " 
 Douglas arrived in South Florida when fewer than 5 @,@ 000 people were recorded on the census in Miami and it was " no more than a <unk> railroad terminal " . Her father , Frank Stoneman , was the first publisher of the paper that later became The Miami Herald . Stoneman <unk> opposed the governor of Florida , Napoleon Bonaparte Broward , and his attempts to drain the Everglades . He infuriated Broward so much that when Stoneman won an election for circuit judge , Governor Broward refused to <unk> the election , so Stoneman was referred to as " Judge " for the rest of his life without performing the duties of one . 
 She joined the staff of the newspaper in 1915 , originally as a society columnist writing about tea parties and society events , but news was so slow she later admitted to making up some of her stories : " Somebody would say , ' Who 's that Mrs. <unk> <unk> you 've got in your column ? ' And I would say , ' Oh , you know , I don 't think she 's been here very long ' " . When her father went on vacation less than a year after her appearance in Miami , he left her the responsibility of the editorial page . She developed a rivalry with an editor at The Miami Metropolis whose greater familiarity with the history of Miami gave her cause to make fun of Douglas in writing . Her father <unk> her to check her facts better . 
 Douglas was given an assignment in 1916 to write a story on the first woman to join the US Naval Reserve from Miami . When the woman did not show up for the interview , Douglas found herself joining the Navy as a <unk> ( F ) first class . It did not suit her ; she disliked rising early and her superiors did not appreciate her <unk> their grammar as a <unk> , so she requested a discharge and joined the American Red Cross , where she was stationed in Paris . She witnessed the tumultuous celebrations on the Rue de <unk> when the Armistice was signed , and she cared for war refugees ; seeing them displaced and in a state of shock , she wrote , " helped me understand the plight of refugees in Miami sixty years later " . 
 Following the war , Douglas took on duties as assistant editor at The Miami Herald . She gained some <unk> through her daily column entitled " The <unk> " , and had enough influence through the newspaper that she became somewhat of a local celebrity . She amassed a devoted readership and attempted to begin each column with a poem . " The <unk> " was topical and went in any direction Douglas chose . She promoted responsible urban planning when Miami saw a population boom of 100 @,@ 000 people in a decade . She wrote supporting women 's suffrage , civil rights , and better sanitation while opposing Prohibition and foreign trade tariffs . 
 Some of the stories she wrote spoke of the wealth of the region being in its " inevitable development " , and she supplemented her income with $ 100 a week from writing copy advertisements that praised the development of South Florida , something she would reconsider later in her life . She wrote a ballad in the 1920s lamenting the death of a 22 @-@ year @-@ old <unk> who was beaten to death in a labor camp , titled " Martin <unk> of North Dakota is Walking Florida Now " . It was printed in The Miami Herald , and read aloud during a session of the Florida Legislature , which passed a law banning convict <unk> , in large part due to her writing . " I think that 's the single most important thing I was ever able to accomplish as a result of something I 've written " , she wrote in her autobiography . 
 After quitting the newspaper in 1923 , Douglas worked as a freelance writer . From 1920 to 1990 , Douglas published 109 fiction articles and stories . One of her first stories was sold to the pulp fiction magazine Black Mask for $ 600 ( equivalent to $ 8 @,@ 330 in 2015 ) . Forty of her stories were published in The Saturday Evening Post ; one titled " Story of a <unk> Woman " was reprinted in 1937 in the Post 's best short stories compilation . Recurring motifs in her fiction were their settings in South Florida , the Caribbean , or Europe during World War I. Her protagonists were often independent , quirky women or youthful <unk> who encountered social or natural <unk> . The people and animals of the Everglades served as subjects for some of her earliest writings . " <unk> " , originally published in the Saturday Evening Post in 1930 , was based on the murder of Guy Bradley , an <unk> Society game <unk> , by <unk> . " Wings " was a <unk> story , also first appearing in the Post in 1931 , that addressed the slaughter of Everglades wading birds for their feathers . Her story " <unk> Treasure of a King " was a second @-@ place <unk> in the O. Henry Award competition in 1928 . 
 During the 1930s , Douglas was commissioned to write a pamphlet supporting a <unk> garden called " An argument for the establishment of a tropical <unk> garden in South Florida . " Its success caused her to be in demand at garden clubs where she delivered speeches throughout the area , then to serve on the board to support the <unk> Garden . She called the garden " one of the greatest achievements for the entire area " . 
 Douglas served as the book review editor of The Miami Herald from 1942 to 1949 , and as editor for the University of Miami Press from 1960 to 1963 . She released her first novel , entitled Road to the Sun , in 1952 . She wrote four novels , and several non @-@ fiction books on regional topics including Florida <unk> and David <unk> , the <unk> turned biologist who imagined a <unk> park in Miami . Her autobiography entitled Marjory Stoneman Douglas : Voice of the River was written with John <unk> in 1987 . She had been working on a book about W. H. Hudson for years , traveling to Argentina and England several times . It was incomplete when she died in 1998 . 
 Early in the 1940s Douglas was approached by a publisher to contribute to the Rivers of America Series by writing about the Miami River . <unk> with it , she called the Miami River about " an inch long " , but in researching it became more interested in the Everglades and persuaded the publisher instead to allow her to write about them . She spent five years researching what little scientific knowledge was recorded about the ecology and history of the Everglades and South Florida . Douglas spent time with geologist <unk> Parker , who discovered that all of South Florida 's fresh water source was the Biscayne <unk> , and it was filled by the Everglades . Parker confirmed the name of the book that has since become the nickname for the Everglades when Douglas , trying to capture the essence of the Everglades , asked if she could safely call the fresh water flowing from Lake Okeechobee a river of grass . 
 The Everglades : River of Grass was published in 1947 and sold out of its first printing a month after being released . The first line of the book , " There are no other Everglades in the world " , has been called the " most famous passage ever written about the Everglades " , and the statement <unk> visitors to the Everglades National Park website . Douglas characterized the Everglades as ecosystems surrounding a river worthy of protecting , that was <unk> connected to the people and cultures of South Florida . She outlined its imminent disappearance in the last chapter titled " The <unk> Hour " : 
 <unk> 's grass fires <unk> uncontrolled . Cane @-@ field fires spread <unk> and <unk> in the saw grass in vast waves and pillars and <unk> mountains of heavy , cream @-@ colored , purple @-@ shadowed smoke . Training planes flying over the Glades dropped bombs or cigarette <unk> , and the fires exploded in the hearts of the drying <unk> and raced on before every wind leaving only <unk> ... There was no water in the canals with which to fight [ the fires ] ... The sweet water the rock had held was gone or had shrunk far down into its strange holes and <unk> . 
 The Everglades : River of Grass galvanized people to protect the Everglades and is compared to Rachel Carson 's 1962 <unk> of the harmful effects of DDT , Silent Spring , as both books are " groundbreaking calls to action that made citizens and politicians take notice " . Its impact is still relevant as it is claimed to be a major reason Florida receives so many tourists , and " remains the definitive reference on the plight of the Florida Everglades " . It has gone through numerous editions , selling 500 @,@ 000 copies since its original publication . The Christian Science <unk> wrote of it in 1997 , " Today her book is not only a classic of environmental literature , it also reads like a <unk> for what <unk> are <unk> as the most extensive environmental restoration project ever undertaken anywhere in the world " . The <unk> to the book 's impact , according to one writer addressing restoration of the Everglades , is that her metaphor is so <unk> dominant that it is inaccurate in describing the complex web of ecosystems within the Everglades : " River of Grass " describes one . David <unk> wrote that despite Douglas ' " appreciation of the complexity of the environmental system " she described , popular conception of the Everglades shared by people who have not read the book <unk> her detailed explanations . 
 Women 's suffrage was an early interest of Douglas , and although she tended to shy away from <unk> in her early work at The Miami Herald , on her third day as a society columnist , she chose suffrage and began to focus on writing about women in leadership positions . In 1917 , she traveled with Mary <unk> Bryan , William Jennings Bryan 's wife , and two other women to <unk> to speak in support of women 's right to vote . Douglas was not impressed with the reception the group got from the Florida Legislature . She wrote about her experience later : " All four of us spoke to a joint committee wearing our best hats . Talking to them was like talking to <unk> images . They never paid attention to us at all . " Douglas was able to vote for the first time after she returned from Europe in 1920 . 
 You can have the most beautiful city in the world as appearance goes , the streets may be clean and shining , the avenues broad and tree lined , the public buildings dignified , adequate and well kept ... but if you have a weak or inadequate health department , or a public opinion <unk> on the subject , all the <unk> of your city will have not value . 
 In 1948 Douglas served on the <unk> Grove <unk> <unk> Committee , with a friend of hers named Elizabeth <unk> , who was horrified to learn that no running water or sewers were connected to the racially segregated part of <unk> Grove . They helped pass a law requiring all homes in Miami to have toilets and <unk> . In the two years it took them to get the referendum passed , they worked to set up a loan operation for the black residents of <unk> Grove , who borrowed the money interest @-@ free to pay for the <unk> work . Douglas noted that all of the money loaned was repaid . 
 Douglas became involved in the Everglades in the 1920s , when she joined the board of the Everglades Tropical National Park Committee , a group led by Ernest F. Coe and dedicated to the idea of making a national park in the Everglades . By the 1960s , the Everglades were in imminent danger of disappearing forever because of gross <unk> in the name of progress and real estate and agricultural development . Encouraged to get involved by the leaders of environmental groups , in 1969 — at the age of 79 — Douglas founded Friends of the Everglades to protest the construction of a jetport in the Big <unk> portion of the Everglades . She justified her involvement saying , " It is a woman 's business to be interested in the environment . It 's an extended form of <unk> . " 
 She toured the state giving " hundreds of ringing <unk> " of the airport project , and increased membership of Friends of the Everglades to 3 @,@ 000 within three years . She ran the public information operation full @-@ time from her home and encountered hostility from the jetport 's developers and <unk> , who called her a " damn butterfly <unk> " . President Richard Nixon , however , scrapped funding for the project due to the efforts of many Everglades <unk> groups . 
 Douglas continued her activism and focused her efforts on restoring the Everglades after declaring that " Conservation is now a dead word ... You can 't conserve what you haven 't got . " Her criticism was directed at two entities she considered were doing the most damage to the Everglades . A coalition of sugarcane <unk> , named Big Sugar , she accused of <unk> Lake Okeechobee by pumping water <unk> with chemicals , human waste , and garbage back into the lake , which served as the fresh water source for the Miami metropolitan area . She compared Florida sugarcane agriculture to sugarcane grown in the West Indies , which , she claimed , was more environmentally sound , had a longer harvest cycle less harmful to soil nutrients , and was less expensive for consumers due to the higher sugar content . 
 Besides Big Sugar , Douglas spoke about the damage the Army Corps of Engineers was doing to the Everglades by diverting the natural flow of water . The Corps was responsible for constructing more than 1 @,@ 400 miles ( 2 @,@ 300 km ) of canals to divert water away from the Everglades after 1947 . When the Central & South Florida Project ( C & SF ) , run by former members of the Corps of Engineers , was proposed to assist the Everglades , Douglas initially gave it her approval , as it promised to deliver much @-@ needed water to the shrinking Everglades . However , in application , the project instead diverted more water away from the Everglades , changed water schedules to meet sugarcane farmers ' irrigation needs , and flat @-@ out refused to release water to Everglades National Park , until much of the land was <unk> . " What a <unk> I turned out to be ! " remarked Douglas , then suggested the motivation behind all the digging and diversion in saying , " Their <unk> obviously never let them play with mud <unk> , so now they take it out on us by playing with cement " . 
 Douglas was giving a speech addressing the harmful practices of the Army Corps of Engineers when the colonel in attendance dropped his pen on the floor . As he was <unk> to pick it up , Douglas stopped her speech and said to him , " Colonel ! You can <unk> under that table and hide , but you can 't get away from me ! " 
 In 1973 , Douglas attended a meeting addressing conservation of the Everglades in Everglades City , and was observed by John <unk> : 
 Mrs. Douglas was half the size of her fellow speakers and she wore huge dark glasses , which along with the huge <unk> hat made her look like Scarlett O <unk> as played by Igor Stravinsky . When she spoke , everybody stopped slapping mosquitoes and more or less came to order . She reminded us all of our responsibility to nature and I don 't remember what else . Her voice had the sobering effect of a one @-@ room <unk> 's . The tone itself seemed to tame the <unk> of the local stone <unk> , plus the developers , and the lawyers on both sides . I wonder if it didn 't also <unk> the mosquitoes ... The request for a Corps of Engineers permit was eventually turned down . This was no surprise to those of us who 'd heard her speak . 
 Douglas was not well received by some audiences . She opposed the drainage of a suburb in Dade County named East Everglades . After the county approved building permits in the Everglades , the land flooded as it had for centuries . When <unk> demanded the Army Corps of Engineers drain their neighborhoods , she was the only opposing voice . At the hearing in 1983 , she was <unk> , <unk> , and shouted at by the audience of residents . " Can 't you <unk> any louder than that ? " she <unk> , eventually making them laugh . " Look . I 'm an old lady . I 've been here since eight o <unk> . It 's now eleven . I 've got all night , and I 'm used to the heat , " she told them . Later , she wrote , " They 're all good souls — they just shouldn 't be out there . " Dade County commissioners eventually decided not to drain . 
 Florida Governor Lawton <unk> explained her impact , saying , " Marjory was the first voice to really wake a lot of us up to what we were doing to our quality of life . She was not just a pioneer of the environmental movement , she was a prophet , calling out to us to save the environment for our children and our grandchildren . " 
 Douglas also served as a charter member of the first American Civil Liberties Union chapter organized in the South in the 1950s . She lent her support to the <unk> Rights Amendment , speaking to the legislature in <unk> urging them to <unk> it . In the 1980s Douglas lent her support to the Florida Rural Legal Services , a group that worked to protect migrant farm workers who were centered on Belle Glade , and who were primarily employed by the sugarcane industry . She wrote to Governor Bob Graham in 1985 to encourage him to assess the conditions the migrant workers endured . The same year , Douglas approached the Dade County School Board and insisted that the Biscayne Nature Center , which had been housed in hot dog stands , needed a building of its own . The center received a portable building until 1991 when the Florida Department of Education endowed $ 1 @.@ 8 million for the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Biscayne Nature Center in <unk> Park . Douglas co @-@ founded the Friends of the Miami @-@ Dade Public <unk> with her longtime friend Helen <unk> , and served as its first president . 
 Although Douglas grew up in an <unk> household , she described herself as agnostic throughout her life , and forbade any religious ceremony at her memorial . Douglas tied her <unk> to her <unk> prayers when her mother was dying . However , she credited the motivation for her support of women 's suffrage to her Quaker paternal grandparents whose dedication to the abolition of slavery she admired , and proudly claimed Levi Coffin , an organizer of the Underground Railroad , was her great @-@ great @-@ uncle . She wrote that his wife was a friend of Harriet <unk> <unk> , and had provided <unk> with the story of Eliza in Uncle Tom 's Cabin fleeing slavery because Douglas ' great @-@ great @-@ aunt took care of Eliza and her infant after their escape . Frank Stoneman grew up in a Quaker colony , and Douglas maintained he kept touches of his upbringing throughout his life , even after converting to <unk> . Writer Jack Davis and neighbor Helen <unk> suggest this Quaker influence was behind Douglas ' use of " Friends " in naming the organizations Friends of the Everglades and Friends of the Miami @-@ Dade Public <unk> . 
 As a child , Douglas was very close with her mother after her parents ' separation . She witnessed her mother 's emotional <unk> that caused her to be <unk> , and even long after her mother returned to live with her , she exhibited bizarre , <unk> behaviors . Following her mother 's death , her relocation to Miami , and her <unk> in working as the assistant editor at The Miami Herald , in the 1920s , she suffered the first of three nervous <unk> . 
 Douglas suggested she had had " blank periods " before starting during her marriage , but they were brief . She connected these <unk> to her mother 's <unk> . She eventually quit the newspaper , but after her father 's death in 1941 she suffered a third and final breakdown , when her neighbors found her <unk> the neighborhood one night screaming . She admitted she had a " father complex " , explaining it by saying , " Having been brought up without him and then coming back and finding him so sympathetic had a powerful effect " . 
 Regardless of her dedication to the preservation of the Everglades , Douglas admitted the time she spent actually there was sporadic , driving there for occasional <unk> . " To be a friend of the Everglades is not necessarily to spend time wandering around out there ... It 's too buggy , too wet , too generally inhospitable " , she wrote . Instead , she understood that the health of the environment indicated the general well @-@ being of humanity . 
 Despite Douglas ' demure appearance — she stood at 5 feet 2 inches ( 1 @.@ 57 m ) and weighed 100 pounds ( 45 kg ) , and was always <unk> dressed in <unk> , a <unk> straw hat and gloves — she had an <unk> ability to get her point across . She was known for speaking in perfect , precise paragraphs , and was respected for her dedication and knowledge of her subjects ; even her critics admitted her authority on the Everglades . Jeff <unk> , a reporter for the St. Petersburg Times who interviewed and wrote several stories about Douglas , wrote of her , " She had a tongue like a <unk> and the moral authority to embarrass <unk> and politicians and make things happen . " Douglas was known for <unk> <unk> reporters who had not read her books and asked <unk> questions . 
 She was attached to several men after her divorce , counting one of them as the reason she enlisted in the Red Cross , as he had already gone to France as a soldier . However , she said she did not believe in <unk> sex and would not have <unk> her father by being <unk> . She told <unk> in 1992 , <unk> , that she had not had sex since her divorce , saying " I wasn 't a wild woman " . However , she was fond of saying she used the emotion and energy instead on her work . " People don 't seem to realize that the energy that goes into sex , all the emotion that surrounds it , can be well employed in other ways " , she wrote in her autobiography . 
 Douglas began <unk> honors since her early days writing for The Miami Herald . In the 1980s , however , the awards became more prestigious , and her reactions to them mixed . The Florida Department of Natural Resources ( now the Florida Department of Environmental Protection ) named its headquarters in <unk> after her in 1980 , which she considered a dubious honor . She told a friend she would have rather seen the Everglades restored than her name on a building . During her polite acceptance speech , she <unk> against Ronald Reagan and the then @-@ Secretary of the Interior James <unk> for their lackluster approach to environmental conservation . The National Parks Conservation Association established the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Award in 1986 , that " honor ( s ) individuals who often must go to great lengths to advocate and fight for the protection of the National Park System " . Despite blindness and diminished hearing , Douglas continued to be active into her second century , and was honored with a visit from Queen Elizabeth II , to whom Douglas gave a signed copy of The Everglades : River of Grass in 1991 . Instead of gifts and celebrations , Douglas asked that trees be planted on her birthday , resulting in over 100 @,@ 000 planted trees across the state and a bald <unk> on the lawn of the governor 's mansion . The South Florida Water Management District began removing exotic plants that had taken hold in the Everglades when Douglas turned 102 . 
 In 1993 , President Bill Clinton awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom , the highest honor given to a civilian . The citation for the medal read , " Marjory Stoneman Douglas <unk> passionate commitment . Her crusade to preserve and restore the Everglades has enhanced our Nation 's respect for our precious environment , reminding all of us of nature 's delicate balance . <unk> Americans honor the ' <unk> of the Glades ' by following her splendid example in <unk> America 's beauty and <unk> for generations to come . " Douglas donated her medal to <unk> College . Most of the others she received she stored on the floor of her home . 
 Douglas was inducted into the National Wildlife Federation Hall of Fame in 1999 , and the National Women 's Hall of Fame in 2000 . John <unk> declared her a feminist before the word existed , but not entirely . Upon hearing that she was to be inducted , she questioned , " Why should they have a Women 's Hall of Fame , as I heard they wanted to put me in the other day ? Why not a Citizen 's Hall of Fame ? " Douglas was included in a tribute to pioneering women when television character Lisa Simpson made a <unk> @-@ <unk> bust of her with Georgia O <unk> and Susan B. Anthony in an early episode of The Simpsons . 
 Some of Douglas ' stories were collected by University of Florida professor Kevin McCarthy in two edited collections : Nine Florida Stories in 1990 and A River In Flood in 1998 . McCarthy wrote that he collected Douglas ' short stories because most people in the 1990s were well aware of her fame as an <unk> , but many did not know about her career as a freelance writer . " Probably no other person has been as important to the environmental well @-@ being of Florida than this little lady from <unk> Grove " , McCarthy wrote in the introduction of A River in Flood . 
 Marjory Stoneman Douglas died at the age of 108 on May 14 , 1998 . John <unk> , who helped write her autobiography , said that her death was the only thing that could " shut her up " but added , " The silence is terrible . " Carl <unk> <unk> her in The Miami Herald , writing that The Everglades : River of Grass was " monumental " , and praised her passion and her resolve ; even when politicians finally found value in the Everglades and visited her for a photo opportunity , she still provoked them to do more and do it faster . 
 The National Wildlife Federation described her as " a passionate , articulate , and <unk> voice for the environment " . Chairman of the Florida <unk> Society Ed <unk> remembered her , saying , " She kept a clear vision of the way things ought to be , and she didn 't give a lot of credibility to <unk> about why they 're not like that . She would give these wonderful , <unk> speeches to which there was no response . You can 't <unk> back to <unk> scolding . All you can do is <unk> your feet and say , ' Yes , Ma <unk> . ' " She was aware of it ; she was reported saying , " People can 't be rude to me , this poor little old woman . But I can be rude to them , poor <unk> , and nobody can stop me . " Her ashes were scattered over the 1 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 acres ( 5 @,@ 300 km2 ) of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Wilderness Area in Everglades National Park . 
 In 2000 , a Naples , Florida @-@ based composer named Steve <unk> wrote a 15 @-@ minute orchestra piece to be performed by the Naples Philharmonic entitled Voice of the Everglades ( <unk> for Marjory Stoneman Douglas ) . <unk> explained his motivation for the piece , saying , " She was outspoken , she was direct , she had the energy and belief to make the world a better place . " Two South Florida public schools are named in her honor : Broward County Public Schools ' Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and Miami @-@ Dade County Public Schools ' Marjory Stoneman Douglas Elementary School . 
 On April 22 , 2015 , while giving an Earth Day speech in the Everglades , President Barack Obama announced that Interior Secretary <unk> Jewell had designated the house a National Historic Landmark .

 On 17 June 1944 , when the Icelandic republic was founded , the <unk> became independent from the Danish monarchy . The language spoken is Icelandic , a North <unk> language , and <unk> is the predominant religion . Historical and DNA records indicate that around 60 to 80 percent of the settlers were of Norse origin ( primarily from Western Norway ) and the rest were of Celtic stock from Ireland and peripheral Scotland . 
 <unk> have had a tumultuous history . Development of the island was slow due to a lack of interest from the countries controlling it for most of its history : Norway , Denmark – Norway , and ultimately Denmark . Through this time , Iceland had relatively little contact with the outside world . The island became independent in union with Denmark in 1918 . Since 1944 , Iceland has been a republic , and Icelandic society has undergone a rapid modernisation process in the post @-@ independence era . 
 Iceland is a <unk> young land mass , having formed an estimated 20 million years ago due to volcanic eruptions on the Mid @-@ Atlantic ridge . One of the last larger islands to remain uninhabited , the first human settlement date is generally accepted to be 874 , although there is some evidence to suggest human activity prior to the Norse arrival . 
 Following <unk> , and also in 874 , another group of <unk> set sail across the North Atlantic Ocean with their families , livestock , slaves and possessions , escaping the domination of the first King of Norway , <unk> <unk> . They traveled 1 @,@ 000 km ( 600 mi ) in their Viking <unk> to the island of Iceland . These people were primarily of Norwegian , Irish or Gaelic Scottish origin . The Irish and the Scottish <unk> were either slaves or servants of the Norse chiefs , according to the Icelandic <unk> , or descendants of a " group of <unk> who had settled in Scotland and Ireland and <unk> with Gaelic @-@ speaking people " . Genetic evidence suggests that approximately 62 % of the Icelandic maternal gene pool is derived from Ireland and Scotland , which is much higher than other Scandinavian countries , although comparable to the <unk> , while 37 % is of Nordic origin . About 20 @-@ 25 % of the Icelandic paternal gene pool is of Gaelic origin , with the rest being Nordic . 
 The Icelandic Age of Settlement ( Icelandic : <unk> ) is considered to have lasted from 874 to 930 , at which point most of the island had been claimed and the <unk> ( English : <unk> ) , the assembly of the Icelandic Commonwealth , was founded at <unk> . 
 In 930 , on the <unk> ( English : <unk> ) plain near Reykjavík , the chieftains and their families met and established the <unk> , Iceland 's first national assembly . However , the <unk> lacked the power to enforce the laws it made . In <unk> , struggles between rival chieftains left Iceland so divided that King <unk> IV of Norway was asked to step in as a final <unk> for all disputes , as part of the Old Covenant . This is known as the Age of the <unk> . 
 Iceland was under Norwegian leadership until <unk> , when the Royal House of Norway died out . At this point , both Iceland and Norway came under the control of the Danish Crown . With the introduction of absolute monarchy in Denmark , the <unk> relinquished their autonomy to the crown , including the right to initiate and consent to legislation . This meant a loss of independence for Iceland , which led to nearly 300 years of decline : perhaps largely because Denmark and its Crown did not consider Iceland to be a colony to be supported and assisted . In particular , the lack of help in defense led to constant raids by <unk> pirates along the Icelandic coasts . 
 Unlike Norway , Denmark did not need Iceland 's fish and <unk> wool . This created a dramatic deficit in Iceland 's trade , and no new ships were built as a result . In <unk> Iceland was forbidden to trade with other countries by order of the Danish Government , and in the 18th century climatic conditions had reached an all @-@ time low since Settlement . 
 In 1783 – 84 <unk> , a volcanic <unk> in the south of the island , erupted . The eruption produced about 15 km ³ ( 3 @.@ 6 mi ³ ) of basalt <unk> , and the total volume of <unk> emitted was 0 @.@ 91 km ³ . The <unk> built up caused a cooling effect in the Northern Hemisphere . The consequences for Iceland were catastrophic , with approximately 25 @-@ 33 % of the population dying in the famine of 1783 and 1784 . Around 80 % of sheep , 50 % of cattle , and 50 % of horses died of <unk> from the 8 million tons of fluorine that were released . This disaster is known as the <unk> <unk> ( Icelandic : <unk> ) . 
 In 1798 – 99 the <unk> was discontinued for several decades , eventually being restored in 1844 . It was moved to Reykjavík , the capital , after being held at <unk> for over nine centuries . 
 The 19th century brought significant improvement in the <unk> ' situation . A protest movement was led by <unk> <unk> , a statesman , historian , and authority on Icelandic literature . Inspired by the romantic and nationalist currents from mainland Europe , <unk> protested strongly , through political journals and self @-@ publications , for ' a return to national consciousness ' and for political and social changes to be made to help speed up Iceland 's development . 
 In 1854 , the Danish government relaxed the trade ban that had been imposed in <unk> , and Iceland gradually began to rejoin Western Europe economically and socially . With this return of contact with other peoples came a <unk> of Iceland 's arts , especially its literature . Twenty years later in 1874 , Iceland was granted a constitution . <unk> today recognize <unk> 's efforts as largely responsible for their economic and social resurgence . 
 Iceland gained near @-@ full independence in 1918 after World War I , and retained only formal ties with the Danish Crown . This move to independence was completed on 17 June 1944 on what would have been <unk> <unk> 's <unk> birthday . After a national referendum , Iceland broke all ties with Denmark , after nearly six centuries of Danish rule , and declared itself independent . 
 Results of the mitochondrial DNA studies have been consistent with the genealogical records that trace the ancestry of most <unk> to Scandinavia , Ireland and Scotland , though there may have been a minor contribution from other European groups . <unk> effects and the effects of genetic drift are more pronounced for the Icelandic gene pool than other nearby populations , supporting the assumed genetic isolation of the population . 
 Greenland was first settled by some 500 <unk> under the leadership of Erik the Red in the late 10th century , CE . <unk> <unk> in this harsh land offered sufficient grazing to support cattle and sheep , though the climate was too cold for cereal crops . Royal trade ships from Norway occasionally went to Greenland to trade for <unk> <unk> and falcons . The population eventually reached a high point of perhaps 3 @,@ 000 in two communities and developed independent institutions before fading away during the 15th century . A papal <unk> was sent there as late as <unk> , the year Columbus attempted to find a shorter <unk> route but instead found the Americas . 
 According to the Saga of Eric the Red , Icelandic immigration to North America dates back to <unk> , when Icelandic <unk> was born in <unk> . This colony was short @-@ lived though and by the <unk> the <unk> abandoned it . Icelandic immigration to North America would not resume for some 800 years . 
 One of the first new instances of Icelandic immigration to North America occurred in 1855 , when a small group settled in Spanish Fork , Utah . Another Icelandic colony is Washington Island , Wisconsin . Immigration to the United States and Canada began in earnest in the 1870s , with most migrants initially settling in the Great Lakes area . These settlers were fleeing famine and overcrowding on Iceland . Today , there are sizable communities of Icelandic descent in both the United States and Canada . <unk> , in Manitoba , Canada , is home to the largest population of <unk> outside of the main island of Iceland . 
 Icelandic , a North <unk> language , is the official language of Iceland ( de facto ; the laws are silent about the issue ) . Icelandic has <unk> grammar comparable to Latin , Ancient Greek , more closely to Old English and practically identical to Old Norse . 
 Old Icelandic literature can be divided into several categories , of which three are best known to foreigners : <unk> poetry , <unk> poetry , and saga literature , if saga literature is understood broadly . <unk> poetry is made up of heroic and mythological poems . Poetry that praises someone is considered <unk> poetry or court poetry . Finally Saga literature is prose , ranging from pure fiction to fairly <unk> history . 
 Written Icelandic has changed little since the 13th century . Because of this , modern readers can understand the <unk> ' <unk> . The <unk> tell of events in Iceland in the 10th and early 11th centuries . They are considered to be the best @-@ known pieces of Icelandic literature . 
 The elder or <unk> <unk> , the younger or <unk> <unk> , and the <unk> are the major pieces of Icelandic literature . The <unk> <unk> is a collection of poems and stories from the late 10th century , whereas the younger or <unk> <unk> is a manual of poetry that contains many stories of Norse mythology . 
 Iceland embraced Christianity in c . AD 1000 , in what is called the <unk> , and the country , while mostly secular in observance , is still predominantly Christian culturally . The Lutheran church claims some 84 % of the total population . While early Icelandic Christianity was more <unk> in its <unk> than traditional Catholicism , <unk> , a religious movement imported from Denmark in the 18th century , had a marked effect on the island . By <unk> all but religious leisure activities , it fostered a certain <unk> , which was for a long time considered an Icelandic stereotype . At the same time , it also led to a boom in printing , and Iceland today is one of the most literate societies in the world . 
 While Catholicism was <unk> by <unk> during the Reformation , most other world religions are now represented on the island : there are small Protestant Free Churches and Catholic communities , and even a nascent Muslim community , composed of both immigrants and local converts . Perhaps unique to Iceland is the fast @-@ growing <unk> , a legally recognized revival of the pre @-@ Christian Nordic religion of the original settlers . According to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Reykjavík , there were only approximately 30 Jews in Iceland as of 2001 . The First Lady of Iceland <unk> <unk> is an Israeli @-@ born <unk> Jew . 
 Icelandic cuisine consists mainly of fish , lamb , and dairy . Fish was once the main part of an <unk> 's diet but has recently given way to <unk> such as beef , pork , and <unk> . 
 The earliest indigenous Icelandic music was the <unk> , epic tales from the Viking era that were often performed a <unk> . Christianity played a major role in the development of Icelandic music , with many hymns being written in the local <unk> . <unk> <unk> , a poet and priest , is noted for writing many of these hymns in the 17th century . The island 's relative isolation ensured that the music maintained its regional flavor . It was only in the 19th century that the first pipe organs , prevalent in European religious music , first appeared on the island . 
 Many singers , groups , and forms of music have come from Iceland . Most Icelandic music contains vibrant folk and pop traditions . Some more recent groups and singers are <unk> <unk> , The <unk> , <unk> , <unk> <unk> , and Of <unk> and Men . 
 The national anthem is " <unk> <unk> <unk> lands " ( English : " Our Country 's God " ) , written by <unk> <unk> , with music by <unk> <unk> . The song was written in 1874 , when Iceland celebrated its one <unk> anniversary of settlement on the island . It was originally published with the title A Hymn in <unk> of Iceland 's Thousand Years . 
 Iceland 's national football team has yet to participate in the FIFA World Cup . However they have qualified for the finals of the 2016 European Championship . Their first Olympic participation was in the 1912 Summer Olympics ; however , they did not participate again until the 1936 Summer Olympics . Their first appearance at the winter games was at the 1948 Winter Olympics . In 1956 , <unk> <unk> won the Olympic silver medal for the triple jump . The Icelandic national <unk> team has enjoyed relative success . The team received a silver medal at the 2008 Olympic Games and a 3rd place at the 2010 European Men 's <unk> Championship . 
 The Canadian federal election of 1957 was held June 10 , 1957 , to select the 265 members of the House of Commons of Canada . In one of the great upsets in Canadian political history , the <unk> Conservative Party ( also known as " <unk> " or " <unk> " ) , led by John <unk> , brought an end to 22 years of Liberal rule , as the <unk> were able to form a minority government . 
 The Liberal Party had governed Canada since 1935 , winning five consecutive elections . Under Prime Ministers William Lyon Mackenzie King and Louis St. <unk> , the government gradually built a welfare state . During the Liberals 's fifth term in office , the opposition parties depicted them as arrogant and <unk> to Canadians ' needs . <unk> events , such as the 1956 " <unk> Debate " over the construction of the Trans @-@ Canada <unk> , had hurt the government . St. <unk> , nicknamed ' Uncle Louis ' , remained popular , but exercised little supervision over his cabinet ministers . 
 In 1956 , Tory leader George A. Drew unexpectedly resigned due to ill health . In his place , the PC party elected the fiery and charismatic <unk> . The <unk> ran a campaign centred on their new leader , who attracted large crowds to rallies and made a strong impression on television . The Liberals ran a <unk> campaign , and St. <unk> made few television appearances . <unk> with the medium , the Prime Minister read his speeches from a script and refused to wear makeup . 
 <unk> their usual strategy of trying to make major <unk> in Liberal @-@ dominated Quebec , the <unk> focused on winning seats in the other provinces . They were successful ; though they gained few seats in Quebec , they won 112 seats overall to the Liberals ' 105 . With the remaining seats won by other parties , the PC party only had a plurality in the House of Commons , but the margin was sufficient to make John <unk> Canada 's first Tory Prime Minister since 1935 . 
 The <unk> had last governed Canada under <unk> Bennett , who had been elected in 1930 . Bennett 's government had limited success in dealing with the Depression , and was defeated in 1935 , as Liberal William Lyon Mackenzie King , who had previously served two times as Prime Minister , was restored to power . The Liberals won five consecutive <unk> between 1935 and 1953 . The Liberals worked closely with the civil service ( drawing several of their ministers from those ranks ) and their years of dominance saw prosperity . 
 When Mackenzie King retired in 1948 , he was succeeded by his Minister of Justice , Louis St. <unk> , a bilingual <unk> who took office at the age of 66 . An adept politician , St. <unk> projected a gentle persona and was <unk> known to many Canadians as Uncle Louis ( or , among <unk> , <unk> Louis ) . In actuality , St. <unk> was uncomfortable away from Ottawa , was subject to fits of depression ( especially after 1953 ) , and on political trips was carefully managed by advertising men from the firm of <unk> Brown . St. <unk> led the Liberals to an overwhelming triumph in the 1949 election , campaigning under the slogan " You never had it so good " . The Liberals won a fifth successive mandate in 1953 , with St. <unk> content to exercise a highly relaxed leadership style . 
 With over twenty years of parliamentary <unk> , Liberal ministers did as they wished with little regard for the opposition parties . The Mackenzie King and St. <unk> governments laid the <unk> for the welfare state , a development initially opposed by many <unk> . <unk> Howe , considered one of the leading forces of the St. <unk> government , told his Tory opponents when they alleged that the Liberals would abolish tariffs if the people would let them , " Who would stop us ? ... Don 't take <unk> too seriously . If we wanted to get away with it , who would stop us ? " 
 At the start of 1956 , the <unk> were led by former Ontario premier George A. Drew , who had been elected PC leader in 1948 over Saskatchewan MP John <unk> . Drew was the fifth man to lead the <unk> in their 21 years out of power . None had come close to defeating the Liberals ; the best performance was in 1945 , when John <unk> secured 67 seats for the <unk> . The Liberals , though , had won 125 seats , and maintained their majority . In the 1953 election , the PC party won 51 seats out of the 265 in the House of Commons . Subsequently the <unk> picked up two seats from the Liberals in by @-@ elections , and the Liberals ( who had won 169 seats in 1953 ) lost an additional seat to the Co @-@ operative Commonwealth Federation ( <unk> , the predecessor of the New Democratic Party ( <unk> ) ) . 
 After over two decades in opposition , the <unk> were closely associated with that role in the public eye . The <unk> were seen as the party of the wealthy and of English @-@ speaking Canada and drew about 30 % of the vote in federal elections . The <unk> had enjoyed little success in Quebec in the past forty years . By 1956 , the Social Credit Party was becoming a potential rival to the <unk> as Canada 's main right @-@ wing party . Canadian journalist and author Bruce <unk> discussed the state of the <unk> in 1956 : 
 When a party calling itself Conservative can think of nothing better than to outbid the Government 's election promises ; when it demands economy in one breath and increased spending in the next ; when it proposes an immediate tax cut regardless of <unk> results ... when in short , the Conservative party no longer gives us a conservative alternative after twenty @-@ one years ... then our political system desperately requires an opposition prepared to stand for something more than the <unk> chance of quick victory . 
 In 1955 , the <unk> , through a determined <unk> , were able to defeat amendments to the Defence <unk> Act , which would have made temporary , extraordinary powers granted to the government permanent . Drew led the <unk> in a second battle with the government the following year : in the so @-@ called " <unk> Debate " , the government invoked closure repeatedly in a weeks @-@ long debate which ended with the Speaker ignoring points of order as he had the division bells <unk> . Both measures were closely associated with Howe , which , in combination with his earlier comments , led to Tory claims that Howe was indifferent to the democratic process . 
 Tory preparations for an upcoming election campaign were thrown into <unk> in August 1956 when Drew fell ill . Tory leaders felt that the party needed vigorous leadership with a federal election likely to be called within a year . In September , Drew resigned . <unk> , who had failed in two prior bids for the leadership , announced his candidacy , as did Tory <unk> Davie Fulton and Donald Fleming . <unk> , a criminal defence lawyer from Prince Albert , Saskatchewan , was on the populist left of the PC party . Those Tory leaders who disliked <unk> and his views , and hoped to find a candidate from Drew 's conservative wing of the party , <unk> University of Toronto president Sidney Smith as a candidate . However , Smith refused to run . 
 Tory leaders scheduled a leadership convention for December . In early November , the Suez crisis erupted . Minister of External Affairs Lester Pearson played a major part in the settlement of that dispute , and was later awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his role . <unk> , as the <unk> ' foreign policy critic and as the favourite in the leadership race , gained considerable attention for his speeches on Suez . The <unk> attacked Pearson for , as they said , being an <unk> boy for the United States government ; he responded that it was better to be such a <unk> than to be an <unk> colonial doing Britain 's will <unk> . While Suez would come to be regarded by many as one of the finest moments in Canadian foreign policy , at the time it cost the Liberals support outside of Quebec . 
 When Parliament convened in January , the Liberals introduced no major proposals , and proposed nothing controversial . <unk> turned over his parliamentary duties to British Columbia MP Howard Green and spent much of his time on the road making speeches across the country . <unk> toured a nation in which Liberal support at the provincial level had slowly been eroding . When the Liberals gained Federal power in 1935 , they controlled eight of the nine provincial governments , all except Alberta . By early 1957 , the Liberals controlled the legislatures only in the tenth province , Newfoundland , and in Prince Edward Island and Manitoba . 
 In March , Finance Minister Walter Harris , who was believed to be St. <unk> 's heir apparent , introduced his budget . The budget anticipated a surplus of $ 258 million , of which $ 100 million was to be returned in the form of increased welfare payments , with an increase of $ 6 per month ( to a total of $ 46 ) for old age pensioners — effective after the election . Harris indicated that no more could be returned for fear of increasing inflation . <unk> attacked the budget , calling for higher old age <unk> and welfare payments , more aid to the poorer provinces , and aid to farmers . 
 St. <unk> had informed <unk> that Parliament would be dissolved in April , for an election on June 10 . A final parliamentary conflict was sparked by the suicide of Canadian Ambassador to Egypt <unk> Norman in the midst of allegations made by a United States Senate <unk> that Norman had communist links . Pearson had defended Norman when the allegations became public , and defended him again after his death , suggesting to the Commons that the allegations were false . It quickly became apparent that the information released by the Americans might have come from Canadian intelligence sources , and after severe questioning of Pearson by <unk> and the other parties ' foreign policy critics , Pearson made a statement announcing that Norman had had communist associations in his youth , but had passed a security review . The minister <unk> further questions regarding what information had been provided , and the discussion was cut short when Parliament was dissolved on April 12 . 
 Peter <unk> , who studied the four elections between 1957 and 1963 , wrote of the situation at the start of the election campaign , " In 1957 , there was no <unk> indication that the Liberals would be beaten or , even in the opposition 's <unk> moment of reflection , could be . All the <unk> and post hoc <unk> at <unk> cannot change that objective fact . " 
 The Liberals and PC party differed considerably on fiscal and tax policies . In his opening campaign speech at Massey Hall in Toronto , <unk> contended that Canadians were <unk> in the amount of $ 120 per family of four . <unk> pledged to reduce taxes and <unk> the Liberals for not reducing taxes despite the government surplus . St. <unk> also addressed tax policy in his opening speech , in Winnipeg . St. <unk> noted that since 1953 , tax rates had declined , as had the national debt , and that Canada had a reputation as a good place for investments . The Prime Minister argued that the cost of campaign promises made by the <unk> <unk> would inevitably drive up the tax rate . <unk> also assailed tight @-@ money monetary policies which kept interest rates high , complaining that they were hitting Atlantic and Western Canada hard . 
 The <unk> promised changes in agricultural policies . Many Canadian farmers were unable to find <unk> for their wheat ; the PC party promised generous cash advances on <unk> wheat and promised a <unk> policy regarding foreign agricultural products . The Liberals argued that such tariffs were not worth the loss of <unk> position in efforts to seek foreign markets for Canadian agricultural products . 
 The Liberals were content to rest on their record in foreign affairs , and doubted that the <unk> could better them . In a radio address on May 30 , Minister of Transport George <unk> commented , " You will wonder as I do who in the Conservative Party would take the place of the Honourable Lester Pearson , whose knowledge and experience of world affairs has been put to such good use in recent years . " <unk> , however , refused to <unk> the point and in a televised address stated that Canadians were " asking Pearson to explain his <unk> of External Affairs " . Though they were reluctant to discuss the Norman affair , the <unk> suggested that the government had <unk> allowed gossip to be transmitted to United States congressional committees . They also attacked the government over Pearson 's role in the Suez settlement , suggesting that Canada had let Britain down . 
 Finally , the <unk> contended that the Liberals had been in power too long , and that it was time for a change . The PC party stated that the Liberals were arrogant , <unk> , and not capable of looking at problems from a new point of view . Liberals responded that with the country prosperous , there was no point to a change . 
 In 1953 , almost half of the <unk> ' campaign funds were spent in Quebec , a province in which the party won only four of seventy @-@ five seats . After the 1953 election , Tory MP Gordon Churchill studied the Canadian federal elections since Confederation . He concluded that the <unk> <unk> were ill @-@ advised to continue pouring money into Quebec in an effort to win seats in the province ; the <unk> could win at least a minority government by <unk> their opportunities in English @-@ speaking Canada , and if the party could also manage to win twenty seats in Quebec , it could attain a majority . Churchill 's conclusions were ignored by most leading <unk> — except <unk> . 
 <unk> began his campaign with a week of local campaigning in his riding , after which he went to Toronto for the Massey Hall speech . After two days in Ontario , he spoke at a rally in Quebec City , before spending the remainder of the first week in the <unk> . The next week saw <unk> spend two days in Quebec , after which he campaigned in Ontario . The next two weeks included a Western tour , with brief returns to Ontario , the most populous province . The final two weeks saw <unk> spend much of the time in Ontario , though with brief journeys east to the <unk> and Quebec and twice west to Saskatchewan . He returned to his riding for the final weekend before the Monday election . He spent 39 days on the campaign trail , eleven more than the Prime Minister . 
 According to Professor John <unk> , who wrote a book about the 1957 campaign , <unk> 's speaking style was " reminiscent of the fiery <unk> so popular in the nineteenth century . Indeed , Mr. <unk> 's <unk> has been likened to that of the <unk> preacher . " As a new face on the national scene given to outspoken attacks on the government , he began to attract unexpectedly large crowds early in the campaign . When reduced to the written word , however , <unk> 's rhetoric sometimes proved to be without much meaning . According to journalist and author Peter C. Newman , " On the printed page , it makes little sense . But from the platform , its effect was far different . " Both Newman and <unk> cite as an example of this the conclusion to the leader 's Massey Hall speech : 
 If we are dedicated to this — and to this we are — you , my fellow Canadians , will require all the wisdom , all the power that comes from those spiritual springs that make freedom possible — all the wisdom , all the faith and all the vision which the Conservative Party gave but yesterday under Macdonald , change to meet changing conditions , today having the responsibility of this party to lay the foundations of this nation for a great and glorious future . 
 <unk> 's speeches contained words which evoked powerful emotions in his listeners . His theme was that Canada was on the edge of greatness — if it could only get rid of its incompetent and arrogant government . He stressed that the only alternative to the Liberals was a " <unk> government " . According to Newman , <unk> successfully drew on the discontent both of those who had prospered in the 1950s , and sought some deeper personal and national purpose , as well as those who had been left out of the prosperity . However , <unk> spoke French badly and the excitement generated by his campaign had little effect in francophone Quebec , where apathy prevailed and Le <unk> spoke of " <unk> <unk> <unk> au <unk> " . 
 The <unk> had performed badly in British Columbia in 1953 , finishing a weak fourth . However , the province responded to <unk> , and 3 @,@ 800 turned out for his Victoria speech on May 21 , his largest crowd yet . This was bettered two days later in Vancouver with a crowd of 6 @,@ 000 , with even the street outside the Georgia Street <unk> packed with Tory <unk> . <unk> responded to this by delivering what Dick Spencer ( who wrote a book on <unk> 's campaigns ) considered his greatest speech of the 1957 race , and which Newman considered the turning point of <unk> 's campaign . <unk> stated , " I give this assurance to Canadians — that the government shall be the servant and not the master of the people ... The road of the Liberal party , unless it is stopped — and Howe has said , " Who 's going to stop us ? " — will lead to the virtual extinction of parliamentary government . You will have the form , but the substance will be gone . " 
 The Liberal @-@ leaning Winnipeg Free Press , writing shortly after <unk> 's speeches in British Columbia , commented on them : 
 <unk> were overwhelmed with sound , passion substituted for arithmetic , moral <unk> pumped up to the <unk> point . But Mr. <unk> provided the <unk> show of the election ... and many listeners undoubtedly failed to notice that he was saying even less than the Prime Minister , though saying it more <unk> and with <unk> fervour ... Mr. <unk> has chosen instead to cast himself as the humble man in a mood of protest , the common Canadian outraged by Liberal prosperity , the little guy fighting for his rights . 
 So far as the crowds mean anything , that posture is a brilliant success at one @-@ night stands . 
 On June 6 , the two major party campaigns crossed paths in Woodstock , Ontario . Speaking in the afternoon , St. <unk> drew a crowd of 200 . To the shock of St. <unk> staffers , who remained for the <unk> appearance , the PC leader drew an overflow crowd of over a thousand that evening , even though he was an hour late , with announcements made to the excited crowd that he was slowed by voters who wanted only to see him or shake his hand . 
 <unk> 's intensive campaign exhausted the handful of national reporters who followed him . Clark <unk> of The Globe and Mail stated , " We did not know how he did it . " <unk> thought the <unk> <unk> might , at best , gain 30 or 35 seats over the 53 they had at dissolution , and when <unk> , off the record , told the reporters that the <unk> would win 97 seats ( which would still allow the Liberals to form the government ) , they concluded he was guilty of <unk> thinking . <unk> was even more confident in public ; after he concluded his national tour and returned to his constituency , he addressed his final rally in <unk> , Saskatchewan : " On Monday , I 'll be Prime Minister . " 
 St. <unk> was utterly confident of an election victory , so much so that he did not even <unk> to fill the sixteen vacancies in the Senate . He had been confident of re @-@ election when Drew led the <unk> , and , according to Liberal minister Lionel <unk> , <unk> 's victory in the party leadership race increased his confidence by a factor of ten . At his press conference detailing his election tour , St. <unk> stated , " I have no doubt about the election outcome . " He indicated that his campaign would open April 29 in Winnipeg , and that the Prime Minister would spend ten days in Western Canada before moving east . However , he indicated he would first go home to Quebec City for several days around Easter ( April 21 in 1957 ) . This break kept him out of the <unk> for ten days at a time when <unk> was already actively campaigning and making daily headlines . At a campaign stop in Jarvis , Ontario , St. <unk> told an aide that he was afraid the right @-@ wing , anti @-@ Catholic Social Credit Party would be the next Opposition . St. <unk> denied Opposition claims that he would resign after an election victory , and the 75 @-@ year @-@ old indicated that he planned to run again in 1961 , if he was still around . 
 The Liberals made no new , radical proposals during their campaign , but instead ran a quiet campaign with occasional attacks on the opposition parties . They were convinced that the public still supported their party , and that no expensive promises need be made to voters . St. <unk> was made the image of the nation 's prosperity , and the Liberals refused to admit any reason for discontent existed . When Minister of Finance Harris proposed raising the upcoming increase in old age <unk> by an additional four dollars a month , St. <unk> refused to consider it , feeling that the increase had been calculated on the basis of the available facts , and those facts had not changed . 
 During the Prime Minister 's Western swing , St. <unk> made formal speeches only in major cities . In contrast to <unk> 's whistle @-@ stop train touring , with a hasty speech in each town as the train passed through , the Liberals allowed ample time for " Uncle Louis " to shake hands with voters , pat their children on the head , and kiss their babies . In British Columbia , St. <unk> took the position that there were hardly any national issues worth discussing — the Liberals had brought Canada prosperity and all that was needed for more of the same was to return the party to office . After touring Western Canada , St. <unk> spent the remainder of the second week of the campaign returning to , and in , Ottawa . The third week opened with a major speech in Quebec City , followed by intensive campaigning in Ontario . The fifth week was devoted to the Maritime provinces and Eastern Quebec . The sixth week opened with a major rally in Ottawa , before St. <unk> returned to the <unk> and Quebec , and the final week was spent in Ontario before St. <unk> returned to his hometown of Quebec City for the election . 
 St. <unk> tried to project an image as a family man , and to that end often addressed schoolchildren . As he had in previous elections , he spoke to small groups of children regarding Canadian history or <unk> . The strategy <unk> while addressing children in Port Hope , Ontario . With the children <unk> , some playing tag or sticking cameras in his face , St. <unk> angrily told them that it was their loss if they did not pay attention , as the country would be theirs to worry about far longer than it would be his . 
 The <unk> was a socialist party , which had much of its strength in Saskatchewan , though it ran candidates in several other provinces . At Parliament 's dissolution in April 1957 , it had 23 MPs , from five different provinces . Aside from the Liberals and the <unk> , it was the only party to nominate a candidate in a majority of the <unk> . In 1957 , the party was led by Saskatchewan MP <unk> <unk> . 
 In 1956 , the party adopted the Winnipeg Declaration , a far more moderate proposal than its previous governing document , the 1933 Regina <unk> . For example , the Regina <unk> pledged the <unk> to the eradication of capitalism ; the Winnipeg Declaration recognized the utility of private ownership of business , and stated that the government should own business only when it was in the public interest . In its election campaign , the <unk> did not promise to <unk> any industries . It promised changes in the tax code in order to increase the <unk> of wealth in Canada . It pledged to increase exemptions from income tax , to allow medical expenses to be considered <unk> from income for tax purposes , and to eliminate sales tax on food , clothing , and other <unk> of life . It also promised to raise taxes on the higher income brackets and to eliminate the favourable tax treatment of corporate <unk> . 
 The <unk> represented many agricultural areas in the Commons , and it proposed several measures to <unk> financial security for farmers . It proposed national <unk> ' <unk> for agricultural products which were exported . It proposed cash advances for farm @-@ stored wheat , short and long term loans for farmers at low interest rates , and government support of prices , to <unk> the farmer a full income even in bad years . For the Atlantic fisherman , the <unk> proposed cash advances at the start of the fishing season and government @-@ owned depots which would sell fishing equipment and supplies to fishermen at much lower than market prices . 
 <unk> suffered from a heart condition , and undertook a much less ambitious schedule than the major party leaders . The party leader left Ottawa for his riding , <unk> — <unk> in Saskatchewan , on April 26 , and remained there until May 10 . He spent three days campaigning in Ontario , then moved west to the major cities of the prairie provinces and British Columbia , before returning to his riding for the final days before the June 10 election . Other <unk> leaders took charge of campaigning in Quebec and the <unk> . 
 By 1957 , the Social Credit Party of Canada had moved far afield from the theories of social credit economics , which its candidates rarely mentioned . Canada 's far @-@ right party , the <unk> were led by <unk> Low , though its Alberta leader , Premier Ernest Manning , was highly influential in the party . The <unk> ' election programme was based on the demand " that Government get out of business and make way for private enterprise " and on their hatred of " all government @-@ inspired schemes to <unk> man and make him <unk> to the state or any monopoly " . 
 The <unk> proposed an increase in the old age <unk> to $ 100 per month . They called for the reversal of the government 's tight money policies , and for low income loans for small business and farmers . It asked for income tax exemptions to be increased to meet the cost of living , and a national housing programme to make home ownership possible for every Canadian family . The party called for a national security policy based on the need for defence , rather than " aggression " , and for a foreign policy which would include food aid to the less @-@ developed nations . 
 The <unk> also objected to the <unk> and other spending in the arts and broadcasting . The party felt that the government should solve economic problems before spending money on the arts . 
 Low challenged the Prime Minister over the Suez issue , accusing him of sending a threatening telegram that caused British Prime Minister Anthony Eden to back off the invasion and so gave the Soviets the opportunity for a military buildup in Egypt . St. <unk> angrily denied the charge and offered to open his correspondence to any of the fifty privy councillors who could then announce whether St. <unk> was telling the truth . Low took St. <unk> up on his challenge , and selected the only living former Prime Minister , Tory Arthur <unk> , but the matter was not resolved before the election , and <unk> was not called upon to examine the correspondence in the election 's aftermath . 
 The Social Credit Party was weakened by considerable conflict between its organizations in the two provinces it controlled , Alberta and British Columbia . It failed to establish a strong national office to run the campaign due to infighting between the two groups . However , it was better financed than the <unk> , due to its popularity among business groups in the West . 
 The <unk> hoped to establish themselves in Ontario , and scheduled their opening rally for Massey Hall in Toronto . The rally was a failure , and even though it ran 40 candidates in Ontario ( up from 9 in 1953 ) , the party won no seats in the province . 
 In 1957 , the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation gave the four recognized parties free air time for political statements . The television broadcasts 's audio tracks served also for use on radio . The three opposition parties gave their party leader all of the broadcast time , though <unk> , who did not speak French well , played only a limited role in the <unk> ' French @-@ language broadcasts . In one , he introduced party president Léon <unk> , a <unk> , who gave the speech . <unk> had no <unk> to makeup and , according to <unk> , was prepared to adopt any technique which would make his presentation more effective . A survey in populous southwestern Ontario showed that <unk> made the strongest impression of the four leaders . 
 Most predictions had the <unk> picking up seats , but the Liberals maintaining a majority . The New York Times reported that Liberals expected to lose a majority of Ontario 's seats , but retain a narrow majority in the House of Commons . Time magazine predicted a Tory gain of 20 to 40 seats and stated that any result which denied the Liberals 133 seats and a majority " would rank as a major upset " . Beck indicates that many journalists , including those sympathetic to the <unk> , saw signs of the coming upset , but <unk> them , convinced that the government was <unk> . Maclean 's , which printed its <unk> issue before the election to go on sale the morning after , ran an editorial noting that Canadians had freely chosen to <unk> the Liberal Party . 
 On Election Night , the first returns came in from <unk> Island , Nova Scotia . Usually a Liberal stronghold , the handful of residents there favoured the <unk> by two votes . St. <unk> listened to the election returns on a radio in the living room of his home on Grande <unk> in Quebec City , and when the radio broke , moved to an upstairs television set . <unk> began the evening at his house in Prince Albert , and once his re @-@ election to the Commons was certain , moved to his local campaign headquarters . 
 The <unk> finished with 112 seats to the Liberals ' 105 , while both the <unk> and Social Credit gained seats in Western Canada and finished with 25 and 19 seats respectively . Nine cabinet ministers , including Howe , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and Harris were defeated . Though the Liberals <unk> the <unk> by over 100 @,@ 000 votes , most of those votes were wasted running up huge margins in Quebec . St. <unk> could have <unk> hung onto power until defeated in the House , but he chose not to , and John <unk> took office as Prime Minister of Canada on June 21 , 1957 . 
 After the election , the Chief Electoral Officer reported to the Speaker of the House of Commons that " the general election appears to have been satisfactorily conducted in accordance with the procedure in the Canada <unk> Act " . 
 There were , however , a number of irregularities . In the Toronto riding of St. Paul 's , four Liberal workers were convicted of various offences for adding almost five hundred names to the electoral register . One of the four was also convicted for two counts of <unk> . While the unsuccessful Liberal candidate , former MP James <unk> , was not charged , Ontario Chief Justice James <unk> <unk> , who investigated the matter , doubted that this could have been done without the candidate 's knowledge . 
 Various violations of law , including <unk> opening ballot boxes , illegal possession of ballots , and adding names to the electoral register , took place in twelve Quebec <unk> . The <unk> felt it had enough evidence to <unk> in five <unk> , and a total of twelve people were convicted . The offences did not affect the outcome of any races . 
 The election of the Liberal candidate in Yukon was contested by the losing Tory candidate . After a trial before the Yukon Territorial Court , that court <unk> the election , holding that enough ineligible people had been permitted to vote to affect the outcome , though the court noted that it was not the fault of the Liberal candidate that these irregularities had occurred . The Tory , Erik Nielsen , won the new election in December 1957 . 
 The election in one Ontario riding , Wellington South was postponed pursuant to statute after the death of the Liberal candidate and MP , Henry Alfred <unk> during the campaign . The Tory candidate , Alfred <unk> , defeated Liberal David <unk> and <unk> candidate Thomas <unk> on July 15 , 1957 . 
 The results of the election surprised the civil service as much as it did the rest of the public . Civil servant and future Liberal minister Mitchell Sharp asked <unk> Howe 's replacement as Minister of Trade and Commerce , Gordon Churchill , not to come to the Ministry 's offices for several days as they were <unk> . Churchill later learned that the staff were moving files out . When Churchill finally came to the Ministry 's offices , he was met with what he termed " the coldest reception that I have ever received in my life " . The new Minister of Labour , Michael Starr , was <unk> three days in a row for parking in the minister 's spot . 
 St. <unk> resigned as leader of the Liberal Party on September 5 , 1957 , but agreed to stay on until a successor was elected . With a lame @-@ duck leader , the Liberals were ineffective in opposition . Paul Martin stated that " I 'm sure I never thought the day would come when [ <unk> ] would ever be a member of a government , let alone head of it . When that happened , the world had come to an end as far as I was concerned . " In January 1958 , St. <unk> was succeeded by Lester Pearson . 
 Even in reporting the election result , newspapers suggested that <unk> would soon call another election and seek a majority . Quebec Tory MP William Hamilton ( who would soon become <unk> General under <unk> ) predicted on the evening of June 10 that there would soon be another election , in which the <unk> would do much better in Quebec . The Tory government initially proved popular among the Canadian people , and <unk> called a snap election . On March 31 , 1958 , the <unk> won the greatest landslide in Canadian federal electoral history in terms of the percentage of seats , taking 208 seats ( including fifty in Quebec ) to the Liberals ' 48 , with the <unk> winning eight and none for Social Credit . 
 Michael <unk> , who wrote a survey of the Canadian Prime Ministers , alluded to Howe 's dismissive comments regarding the <unk> as he summed up the 1957 election : 
 The pipeline debate of 1956 sparked a dramatic opposition stand on the importance of free parliamentary debate . Their arrogance did the <unk> [ Liberals ] enormous damage , contributing heavily to the government 's problems in the 1957 general election . Under the <unk> of television cameras in that campaign , St. <unk> , Howe , and company now appeared to be a lot of wooden , tired old men who had lost touch with Canada . The voters decided to stop them . 
 The Other 4 seats were ( 2 ) Independent , ( 1 ) Independent Liberal , ( 1 ) Independent PC . One Liberal @-@ Labour candidate was elected and sat with the Liberal <unk> , as happened after the 1953 election . 
 The X @-@ Files : The Album is a 1998 soundtrack album released to accompany the film The X @-@ Files . Released on June 2 , 1998 , the album features songs by various artists , including several who had contributed to the earlier album Songs in the Key of X : Music from and Inspired by the X @-@ Files , and consists mostly of cover versions or <unk> of earlier material . 
 The X @-@ Files : The Album received mostly positive criticism upon its release , and charted in several countries worldwide , recording a peak position of number 5 in New Zealand . 
 Although The X @-@ Files : The Album is the soundtrack to the 1998 film The X @-@ Files , only one of the album 's songs — " Crystal Ship " by X — is actually heard during the film , briefly playing on a <unk> during a brief scene . The album 's producer , David Was , intended to match the film 's tone rather than using the songs as content , leading to several of the artists involved contributing material which would seem " <unk> eerie " compared to their usual work . 
 Many of the songs on The X @-@ Files : The Album are cover versions or <unk> of earlier material — singer Sting collaborated with the group <unk> to perform a reggae cover of " Invisible Sun " , which he had earlier recorded with The Police ; <unk> 's " One " is a <unk> of a song made famous by Three Dog Night ; while Foo Fighters contributed a new version of their song " Walking After You " . All but one of the album 's tracks are exclusive to the soundtrack , with <unk> 's " Hunter " having been previously released on the 1997 album <unk> . Several of the artists on the album 's roster — Foo Fighters , <unk> and Soul <unk> — had previously contributed material to Songs in the Key of X : Music from and Inspired by the X @-@ Files , the soundtrack album which accompanied the television series ; however , Chris Carter , creator of The X @-@ Files , stated before the album 's release that although " there are some similarities " between the records , " there are different artists and a different flavor " . 
 The inclusion of a track by the group <unk> was spurred by fact that The X @-@ Files star David Duchovny had first met then @-@ wife <unk> Leoni through their mutual appreciation for the group ; while The <unk> were approached about contributing material after Carter saw them performing on a tour of the United States . The <unk> cover of " One " was deliberately constructed by Was once he realized that Duchovny had ad @-@ <unk> the song 's opening line during one of the film 's scenes . The album 's final track — a cover by <unk> Brothers of Mark Snow 's opening theme for the television series — features a hidden track which plays after a period of silence . The track features a spoken word segment by Carter which explains the series ' overarching mythology up to the film 's release . 
 The European and Japanese releases include an extra track , " <unk> X " by Mike Oldfield . This is a variation of Mark Snow 's " The X @-@ Files Theme " incorporating elements of Oldfield 's <unk> Bells . 
 The X @-@ Files : The Album was first released on June 2 , 1998 , with international releases occurring between July and October that same year . The soundtrack appeared in several charts upon its release , reaching a peak position of 26 in the United States ' Billboard 200 albums chart , 21 in Austria 's <unk> Austria Top 40 , 27 in Australia 's ARIA Charts , and 5 — its highest chart position — in the Official New Zealand Music Chart . 
 The X @-@ Files : The Album has received generally positive reviews . AllMusic 's Stephen Thomas Erlewine awarded the soundtrack four stars out of five , calling it " the best <unk> @-@ rock soundtrack of the summer of 1998 " . Erlewine felt that the album was more polished and well @-@ produced than Songs in the Key of X ; however , he noted that this came at the expense of the earlier record 's " quirky " and " off @-@ <unk> " aesthetic . Erlewine singled out " <unk> Light " and " Hunter " as particular highlights of the album . Jim <unk> of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times rated the album one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of four , finding the album to be predictable and " phone [ d ] in " ; he highlighted the songs by <unk> , Foo Fighters , <unk> and <unk> to be particular low points for him . 
 Writing for Entertainment Weekly , David Brown rated the album a B − , finding that it " isn ’ t eccentric enough " compared to the film or series . Browne found that the contributions by Noel Gallagher and <unk> matched the tone of The X @-@ Files , but felt that <unk> , <unk> , Sting and <unk> had been included out of commercial rather than artistic interest . Keith <unk> of the The A.V. Club considered the soundtrack to be less interesting than the accompanying film score , finding the album 's roster to be formulaic and several of its tracks to not be particularly " <unk> " or " radical " . 
 Following the discovery of the planet Neptune in 1846 , there was considerable speculation that another planet might exist beyond its orbit . The search began in the mid @-@ 19th century and culminated at the start of the 20th with Percival Lowell 's quest for Planet X. Lowell proposed the Planet X hypothesis to explain apparent discrepancies in the orbits of the giant planets , particularly <unk> and Neptune , speculating that the gravity of a large unseen ninth planet could have <unk> <unk> enough to account for the irregularities . 
 Clyde <unk> 's discovery of Pluto in 1930 appeared to <unk> Lowell 's hypothesis , and Pluto was officially named the ninth planet . In 1978 , Pluto was conclusively determined to be too small for its gravity to affect the giant planets , resulting in a brief search for a tenth planet . The search was largely abandoned in the early 1990s , when a study of measurements made by the Voyager 2 spacecraft found that the irregularities observed in <unk> 's orbit were due to a slight <unk> of Neptune 's mass . After 1992 , the discovery of numerous small icy objects with similar or even wider orbits than Pluto led to a debate over whether Pluto should remain a planet , or whether it and its neighbours should , like the asteroids , be given their own separate classification . Although a number of the larger members of this group were initially described as planets , in 2006 the International Astronomical Union reclassified Pluto and its largest neighbours as dwarf planets , leaving Neptune the farthest known planet in the Solar System . 
 While today the astronomical community widely agrees that Planet X , as originally envisioned , does not exist , the concept of an as @-@ yet @-@ <unk> planet has been revived by a number of astronomers to explain other <unk> observed in the outer Solar System . As of March 2014 , observations with the <unk> telescope have ruled out the possibility of a Saturn @-@ sized object ( 95 Earth mass ) out to 10 @,@ 000 AU , and a Jupiter @-@ sized or larger object out to 26 @,@ 000 AU . 
 In 2014 , based on similarities of the orbits of a group of recently discovered extreme trans @-@ <unk> objects , astronomers hypothesized the existence of a super @-@ Earth planet , 2 to 15 times the mass of the Earth and beyond 200 AU with possibly a high inclined orbit at some 1500 AU . In 2016 further work showed this unknown distant planet is likely on an inclined , eccentric orbit that goes no closer than about 200 AU and no further than about 1600 AU from the Sun . The orbit is predicted to be anti @-@ aligned to the clustered extreme trans @-@ <unk> objects . Because Pluto is no longer considered a planet by the International Astronomical Union , this new hypothetical object has become known as Planet Nine . 
 In 1848 , Jacques <unk> raised an <unk> to Le <unk> 's calculations , claiming that Neptune 's observed mass was smaller and its orbit larger than Le <unk> had initially predicted . He postulated , based largely on simple <unk> from Le <unk> 's calculations , that another planet of roughly 12 Earth masses , which he named " Hyperion " , must exist beyond Neptune . Le <unk> denounced <unk> 's hypothesis , saying , " [ There is ] absolutely nothing by which one could determine the position of another planet , barring hypotheses in which imagination played too large a part . " 
 In 1850 James Ferguson , Assistant <unk> at the United States Naval Observatory , noted that he had " lost " a star he had observed , <unk> , which Lt. Matthew <unk> , the superintendent of the Observatory , claimed was evidence that it must be a new planet . Subsequent searches failed to recover the " planet " in a different position , and in 1878 , <unk> Peters , director of the Hamilton College Observatory in New York , showed that the star had not in fact vanished , and that the previous results had been due to human error . 
 In 1879 , Camille <unk> noted that the comets 1862 III and 1889 III had <unk> of 47 and 49 AU , respectively , suggesting that they might mark the orbital radius of an unknown planet that had dragged them into an elliptical orbit . <unk> Georges Forbes concluded on the basis of this evidence that two planets must exist beyond Neptune . He calculated , based on the fact that four comets possessed <unk> at around 100 AU and a further six with <unk> clustered at around 300 AU , the orbital elements of a pair of hypothetical trans @-@ <unk> planets . These elements <unk> <unk> with those made independently by another astronomer named David Peck Todd , suggesting to many that they might be valid . However , <unk> argued that the orbits of the comets involved were still too uncertain to produce meaningful results . 
 In 1900 and 1901 , Harvard College Observatory director William Henry Pickering led two searches for trans @-@ <unk> planets . The first was begun by Danish astronomer Hans Emil <unk> who , after studying the data on the orbit of <unk> from 1690 to 1895 , concluded that one trans @-@ <unk> planet alone could not account for the discrepancies in its orbit , and postulated the position of two planets he believed were responsible . The second was launched when Gabriel <unk> suggested that a single trans @-@ <unk> planet lying at 47 AU could account for the motion of <unk> . Pickering agreed to examine plates for any suspected planets . In neither case were any found . 
 In 1909 , Thomas Jefferson Jackson See , an astronomer with a reputation as an <unk> <unk> , opined " that there is certainly one , most likely two and possibly three planets beyond Neptune " . <unk> naming the first planet " <unk> " , he placed their respective distances at 42 , 56 and 72 AU from the Sun . He gave no indication as to how he determined their existence , and no known searches were mounted to locate them . 
 In 1894 , with the help of William Pickering , Percival Lowell , a wealthy <unk> , founded the Lowell Observatory in <unk> , Arizona . In 1906 , convinced he could resolve the <unk> of <unk> 's orbit , he began an extensive project to search for a trans @-@ <unk> planet , which he named Planet X. The X in the name represents an unknown and is pronounced as the letter , as opposed to the Roman <unk> for 10 ( at the time , Planet X would have been the ninth planet ) . Lowell 's hope in tracking down Planet X was to establish his scientific credibility , which had <unk> him thanks to his widely derided belief that channel @-@ like features visible on the surface of Mars were canals constructed by an intelligent civilization . 
 Lowell 's first search focused on the ecliptic , the plane encompassed by the <unk> where the other planets in the Solar System lie . Using a 5 @-@ inch photographic camera , he manually examined over 200 three @-@ hour exposures with a <unk> glass , and found no planets . At that time Pluto was too far above the ecliptic to be <unk> by the survey . After revising his predicted possible locations , Lowell conducted a second search from 1914 to 1916 . In 1915 , he published his <unk> of a Trans @-@ <unk> Planet , in which he concluded that Planet X had a mass roughly seven times that of Earth — about half that of Neptune — and a mean distance from the Sun of 43 AU . He assumed Planet X would be a large , low @-@ density object with a high albedo , like the giant planets . As a result , it would show a disc with diameter of about one <unk> and an apparent magnitude of between 12 and 13 — bright enough to be spotted . 
 <unk> , in 1908 , Pickering announced that , by <unk> irregularities in <unk> 's orbit , he had found evidence for a ninth planet . His hypothetical planet , which he termed " Planet O " ( because it came after " N " , i.e. Neptune ) , possessed a mean orbital radius of 51 @.@ 9 AU and an orbital period of 373 @.@ 5 years . <unk> taken at his observatory in <unk> , Peru , showed no evidence for the predicted planet , and British astronomer P. H. Cowell showed that the irregularities observed in <unk> 's orbit virtually disappeared once the planet 's displacement of longitude was taken into account . Lowell himself , despite his close association with Pickering , dismissed Planet O out of hand , saying , " This planet is very properly designated " O " , [ for it ] is nothing at all . " Unbeknownst to Pickering , four of the photographic plates taken in the search for " Planet O " by astronomers at the Mount Wilson Observatory in 1919 captured images of Pluto , though this was only recognised years later . Pickering went on to suggest many other possible trans @-@ <unk> planets up to the year 1932 , which he named P , Q , R , S , T and U ; none were ever detected . 
 Lowell 's sudden death in 1916 temporarily halted the search for Planet X. <unk> to find the planet , according to one friend , " virtually killed him " . Lowell 's widow , Constance , engaged in a legal battle with the observatory over Lowell 's legacy which halted the search for Planet X for several years . In 1925 , the observatory obtained glass discs for a new 13 in ( 33 cm ) wide @-@ field telescope to continue the search , constructed with funds from Abbott Lawrence Lowell , Percival 's brother . In 1929 the observatory 's director , <unk> Melvin <unk> , summarily handed the job of locating the planet to Clyde <unk> , a 22 @-@ year @-@ old Kansas farm boy who had only just arrived at the Lowell Observatory after <unk> had been impressed by a sample of his astronomical drawings . 
 <unk> 's task was to systematically capture sections of the night sky in pairs of images . Each image in a pair was taken two weeks apart . He then placed both images of each section in a machine called a <unk> <unk> , which by exchanging images quickly created a time lapse illusion of the movement of any planetary body . To reduce the chances that a faster @-@ moving ( and thus closer ) object be mistaken for the new planet , <unk> <unk> each region near its opposition point , 180 degrees from the Sun , where the apparent <unk> motion for objects beyond Earth 's orbit is at its strongest . He also took a third image as a control to eliminate any false results caused by defects in an individual plate . <unk> decided to image the entire <unk> , rather than focus on those regions suggested by Lowell . 
 By the beginning of 1930 , <unk> 's search had reached the constellation of Gemini . On 18 February 1930 , after searching for nearly a year and examining nearly 2 million stars , <unk> discovered a moving object on photographic plates taken on 23 January and 29 January of that year . A lesser @-@ quality photograph taken on January 21 confirmed the movement . Upon confirmation , <unk> walked into <unk> 's office and declared , " Doctor <unk> , I have found your Planet X. " The object lay just six degrees from one of two locations for Planet X Lowell had suggested ; thus it seemed he had at last been vindicated . After the observatory obtained further <unk> photographs , news of the discovery was <unk> to the Harvard College Observatory on March 13 , 1930 . The new object was later <unk> on photographs dating back to 19 March 1915 . The decision to name the object Pluto was intended in part to honour Percival Lowell , as his initials made up the word 's first two letters . After discovering Pluto , <unk> continued to search the ecliptic for other distant objects . He found hundreds of variable stars and asteroids , as well as two comets , but no further planets . 
 To the observatory 's disappointment and surprise , Pluto showed no visible disc ; it appeared as a point , no different from a star , and , at only 15th magnitude , was six times <unk> than Lowell had predicted , which meant it was either very small , or very dark . Because Lowell astronomers thought Pluto was massive enough to <unk> planets , they assumed that it should have an albedo of 0 @.@ 07 ( meaning that it reflected only 7 % of the light that hit it ) ; about as dark as asphalt and similar to that of Mercury , the least reflective planet known . This would give Pluto an assumed diameter of about 8 @,@ 000 km , or about 60 % that of Earth . Observations also revealed that Pluto 's orbit was very elliptical , far more than that of any other planet . 
 Throughout the mid @-@ 20th century , estimates of Pluto 's mass were revised downward . In 1931 , Nicholson and <unk> calculated its mass , based on its supposed effect on the giant planets , as roughly that of Earth ; a value somewhat in accord with the 0 @.@ 91 Earth mass calculated in 1942 by Lloyd R. <unk> at the US Naval Observatory , using the same assumptions . In 1949 , Gerard <unk> 's measurements of Pluto 's diameter with the 200 inch telescope at Mount <unk> Observatory led him to the conclusion that it was midway in size between Mercury and Mars and that its mass was most probably about 0 @.@ 1 Earth mass . 
 Pluto 's size was finally determined conclusively in 1978 , when American astronomer James W. Christy discovered its moon <unk> . This enabled him , together with Robert Sutton Harrington of the U.S. Naval Observatory , to measure the mass of the Pluto – <unk> system directly by observing the moon 's orbital motion around Pluto . They determined Pluto 's mass to be 1 @.@ 31 × <unk> kg ; roughly one five @-@ hundredth that of Earth or one @-@ sixth that of the Moon , and far too small to account for the observed discrepancies in the orbits of the outer planets . Lowell 's " prediction " had been a coincidence : If there was a Planet X , it was not Pluto . 
 After 1978 , a number of astronomers kept up the search for Lowell 's Planet X , convinced that , because Pluto was no longer a viable candidate , an unseen tenth planet must have been <unk> the outer planets . 
 In the 1980s and 1990s , Robert Harrington led a search to determine the real cause of the apparent irregularities . He calculated that any Planet X would be at roughly three times the distance of Neptune from the Sun ; its orbit would be highly eccentric , and strongly inclined to the ecliptic — the planet 's orbit would be at roughly a 32 @-@ degree angle from the orbital plane of the other known planets . This hypothesis was met with a mixed reception . Noted Planet X <unk> Brian G. <unk> of the Minor Planet Center pointed out that these discrepancies were a hundredth the size of those noticed by Le <unk> , and could easily be due to <unk> error . 
 In 1972 , Joseph Brady of the Lawrence <unk> National Laboratory studied irregularities in the motion of Halley 's Comet . Brady claimed that they could have been caused by a Jupiter @-@ sized planet beyond Neptune at 59 AU that is in a <unk> orbit around the Sun . However , both <unk> and Planet X proponent P. Kenneth <unk> attacked the hypothesis , showing that Halley 's Comet randomly and irregularly <unk> jets of material , causing changes to its own orbital trajectory , and that such a massive object as Brady 's Planet X would have severely affected the orbits of known outer planets . 
 Although its mission did not involve a search for Planet X , the <unk> space observatory made headlines briefly in 1983 due to an " unknown object " that was at first described as " possibly as large as the giant planet Jupiter and possibly so close to Earth that it would be part of this Solar System " . Further analysis revealed that of several unidentified objects , nine were distant galaxies and the tenth was " interstellar <unk> " ; none were found to be Solar System bodies . 
 In 1988 , A. A. Jackson and R. M. <unk> studied the stability of Pluto 's resonance with Neptune by placing test " Planet X @-@ es " with various masses and at various distances from Pluto . Pluto and Neptune 's orbits are in a 3 : 2 resonance , which prevents their collision or even any close approaches , regardless of their separation in the <unk> axis . It was found that the hypothetical object 's mass had to exceed 5 Earth masses to break the resonance , and the <unk> space is quite large and a large variety of objects could have existed beyond Pluto without disturbing the resonance . Four test orbits of a trans @-@ <unk> planet have been integrated forward for four million years in order to determine the effects of such a body on the stability of the Neptune – Pluto 3 : 2 resonance . <unk> beyond Pluto with masses of 0 @.@ 1 and 1 @.@ 0 Earth masses in orbits at 48 @.@ 3 and 75 @.@ 5 AU , respectively , do not <unk> the 3 : 2 resonance . Test planets of 5 Earth masses with semi @-@ major axes of 52 @.@ 5 and 62 @.@ 5 AU disrupt the four @-@ million @-@ year <unk> of Pluto 's argument of perihelion . 
 Harrington died in January 1993 , without having found Planet X. Six months before , E. Myles <unk> had used data from Voyager 2 's 1989 flyby of Neptune , which had revised the planet 's total mass downward by 0 @.@ 5 % — an amount comparable to the mass of Mars — to <unk> its gravitational effect on <unk> . When Neptune 's newly determined mass was used in the Jet <unk> Laboratory <unk> <unk> ( <unk> DE ) , the supposed discrepancies in the <unk> orbit , and with them the need for a Planet X , vanished . There are no discrepancies in the <unk> of any space probes such as Pioneer 10 , Pioneer 11 , Voyager 1 , and Voyager 2 that can be attributed to the gravitational pull of a large <unk> object in the outer Solar System . Today , most astronomers agree that Planet X , as Lowell defined it , does not exist . 
 After the discovery of Pluto and <unk> , no more trans @-@ <unk> objects ( <unk> ) were found until ( <unk> ) 1992 <unk> in 1992 . Since then , thousands of such objects have been discovered . Most are now recognized as part of the <unk> belt , a swarm of icy bodies left over from the Solar System 's formation that orbit near the ecliptic plane just beyond Neptune . Though none were as large as Pluto , some of these distant trans @-@ <unk> objects , such as <unk> , were initially described in the media as " new planets " . 
 In 2005 , astronomer Mike Brown and his team announced the discovery of 2003 <unk> ( later named <unk> after the Greek goddess of <unk> and <unk> ) , a trans @-@ <unk> object then thought to be just barely larger than Pluto . Soon afterwards , a NASA Jet <unk> Laboratory press release described the object as the " tenth planet " . 
 <unk> was never officially classified as a planet , and the 2006 definition of planet defined both <unk> and Pluto not as planets but as dwarf planets because they have not cleared their neighbourhoods . They do not orbit the Sun alone , but as part of a population of similarly sized objects . Pluto itself is now recognized as being a member of the <unk> belt and the largest dwarf planet , larger than the more @-@ massive <unk> . 
 A number of astronomers , most notably Alan Stern , the head of NASA 's New Horizons mission to Pluto , contend that the IAU 's definition is flawed , and that Pluto and <unk> , and all large trans @-@ <unk> objects , such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Varuna and <unk> , should be considered planets in their own right . However , the discovery of <unk> did not <unk> the Planet X theory because it is far too small to have significant effects on the outer planets ' orbits . 
 Although most astronomers accept that Lowell 's Planet X does not exist , a number have revived the idea that a large unseen planet could create observable gravitational effects in the outer Solar System . These hypothetical objects are often referred to as " Planet X " , although the conception of these objects may differ considerably from that proposed by Lowell . 
 When <unk> was discovered , its extreme orbit raised questions about its origin . Its perihelion is so distant ( approximately 75 AU ) that no currently observed mechanism can explain <unk> 's eccentric distant orbit . It is too far from the planets to have been affected by the gravity of Neptune or the other giant planets and too bound to the Sun to be affected by outside forces such as the galactic tides . <unk> to explain its orbit include that it was affected by a passing star , that it was captured from another planetary system , or that it was <unk> into its current position by a trans @-@ <unk> planet . The most obvious solution to determining <unk> 's peculiar orbit would be to locate a number of objects in a similar region , whose various orbital <unk> would provide an indication as to their past history . If <unk> had been pulled into its orbit by a trans @-@ <unk> planet , any other objects found in its region would have a similar perihelion to <unk> ( around 80 AU ) . 
 In 2012 , Rodney <unk> modelled the orbits of 92 <unk> belt objects and found that six of those orbits were far more elongated than the model predicted . He concluded that the simplest explanation was the gravitational pull of a distant planetary companion , such as a Neptune @-@ sized object at 1500 AU or a Mars @-@ sized object at around 53 AU . 
 In 2014 , astronomers announced the discovery of 2012 <unk> , a large object with a <unk> @-@ like <unk> @-@ year orbit and a perihelion of roughly 80 AU , which led them to suggest that it offered evidence of a potential trans @-@ <unk> planet . Trujillo and <unk> argued that the orbital <unk> of arguments of <unk> for <unk> and other extremely distant <unk> suggests the existence of a " super @-@ Earth " of between 2 and 15 Earth masses beyond 200 AU and possibly on an inclined orbit at 1500 AU . 
 In 2014 astronomers at the <unk> <unk> in Madrid suggested that the available data actually indicate more than one trans @-@ <unk> planet . 
 On January 20 , 2016 , Brown and <unk> <unk> published an article <unk> Trujillo and <unk> 's initial findings ; proposing a super @-@ Earth ( dubbed Planet Nine ) based on a statistical <unk> of the arguments of <unk> ( noted before ) near zero and also ascending nodes near 113 ° of six distant trans @-@ <unk> objects . They estimated it to be ten times the mass of Earth ( about 60 % the mass of Neptune ) with a <unk> axis of approximately 400 – 1500 AU . 
 Even without gravitational evidence , Mike Brown , the <unk> of <unk> , has argued that <unk> 's 12 @,@ 000 @-@ year orbit means that probability alone suggests that an Earth @-@ sized object exists beyond Neptune . <unk> 's orbit is so eccentric that it spends only a small fraction of its orbital period near the Sun , where it can be easily observed . This means that unless its discovery was a freak accident , there is probably a substantial population of objects roughly <unk> 's diameter yet to be observed in its orbital region . Mike Brown noted that " <unk> is about three @-@ quarters the size of Pluto . If there are sixty objects three @-@ quarters the size of Pluto [ out there ] then there are probably forty objects the size of Pluto ... If there are forty objects the size of Pluto , then there are probably ten that are twice the size of Pluto . There are probably three or four that are three times the size of Pluto , and the biggest of these objects ... is probably the size of Mars or the size of the Earth . " However , he notes that , should such an object be found , even though it might approach Earth in size , it would still be a dwarf planet by the current definition , because it would not have cleared its neighbourhood sufficiently . 
 The <unk> theory of planet formation states that there were hundreds of planet @-@ sized objects , known as <unk> , in the early stages of the Solar System 's evolution . In 2005 , astronomer Eugene <unk> speculated that although some of these <unk> became the planets we know today , most would have been flung outward by gravitational interactions . Some may have escaped the Solar System altogether to become free @-@ floating planets , whereas others would be orbiting in a <unk> around the Solar System , with orbital periods of millions of years . This <unk> would lie at between 1 @,@ 000 and 10 @,@ 000 AU from the Sun , or between a third and a <unk> the distance to the <unk> cloud . 
 As of 2016 the following observations severely <unk> the mass and distance of any possible additional Solar System planet : 
 An analysis of mid @-@ infrared observations with the <unk> telescope have ruled out the possibility of a Saturn @-@ sized object ( 95 Earth masses ) out to 10 @,@ 000 AU , and a Jupiter @-@ sized or larger object out to 26 @,@ 000 AU . 
 In physics , <unk> happens when light or other electromagnetic radiation from an object is increased in wavelength , or shifted to the red end of the spectrum . In general , whether or not the radiation is within the visible spectrum , " <unk> " means an increase in wavelength – equivalent to a lower frequency and a lower <unk> energy , in accordance with , respectively , the wave and quantum theories of light . 
 Knowledge of <unk> and <unk> has been applied to develop several terrestrial technologies such as <unk> radar and radar guns . <unk> are also seen in the spectroscopic observations of astronomical objects . Its value is represented by the letter <unk> . 
 The history of the subject began with the development in the 19th century of wave mechanics and the exploration of phenomena associated with the <unk> effect . The effect is named after Christian <unk> , who offered the first known physical explanation for the phenomenon in 1842 . The hypothesis was tested and confirmed for sound waves by the Dutch scientist <unk> <unk> <unk> in 1845 . <unk> correctly predicted that the phenomenon should apply to all waves , and in particular suggested that the varying colors of stars could be attributed to their motion with respect to the Earth . Before this was verified , however , it was found that stellar colors were primarily due to a star 's temperature , not motion . Only later was <unk> vindicated by verified <unk> observations . 
 The earliest occurrence of the term " red @-@ shift " in print ( in this <unk> form ) appears to be by American astronomer Walter S. Adams in 1908 , in which he mentions " Two methods of investigating that nature of the <unk> red @-@ shift " . The word does not appear <unk> until about 1934 by Willem de <unk> , perhaps indicating that up to that point its German equivalent , <unk> , was more commonly used . 
 <unk> ( and <unk> ) may be characterized by the relative difference between the observed and emitted <unk> ( or frequency ) of an object . In astronomy , it is customary to refer to this change using a <unk> quantity called <unk> . If <unk> represents wavelength and f represents frequency ( note , <unk> = c where c is the speed of light ) , then <unk> is defined by the <unk> : 
 In general relativity one can <unk> several important special @-@ case formulae for <unk> in certain special <unk> <unk> , as summarized in the following table . In all cases the magnitude of the shift ( the value of <unk> ) is independent of the wavelength . 
 If a source of the light is moving away from an observer , then <unk> ( <unk> > 0 ) occurs ; if the source moves towards the observer , then <unk> ( <unk> < 0 ) occurs . This is true for all electromagnetic waves and is explained by the <unk> effect . Consequently , this type of <unk> is called the <unk> <unk> . If the source moves away from the observer with velocity v , which is much less than the speed of light ( v <unk> c ) , the <unk> is given by 
 where c is the speed of light . In the classical <unk> effect , the frequency of the source is not modified , but the <unk> motion causes the illusion of a lower frequency . 
 A more complete treatment of the <unk> <unk> requires considering <unk> effects associated with motion of sources close to the speed of light . A complete derivation of the effect can be found in the article on the <unk> <unk> effect . In brief , objects moving close to the speed of light will experience deviations from the above formula due to the time <unk> of special relativity which can be corrected for by introducing the <unk> factor γ into the classical <unk> formula as follows ( for motion solely in the line of sight ) : 
 This phenomenon was first observed in a 1938 experiment performed by Herbert E. <unk> and <unk> <unk> , called the <unk> – <unk> experiment . 
 Since the <unk> factor is dependent only on the magnitude of the velocity , this causes the <unk> associated with the <unk> correction to be independent of the orientation of the source movement . In contrast , the classical part of the formula is dependent on the projection of the movement of the source into the line @-@ of @-@ sight which yields different results for different orientations . If <unk> is the angle between the direction of relative motion and the direction of emission in the observer 's frame ( zero angle is directly away from the observer ) , the full form for the <unk> <unk> effect becomes : 
 90 ° ) to the direction of relative motion in the observer 's frame , the <unk> <unk> is known as the transverse <unk> , and a <unk> : 
 is measured , even though the object is not moving away from the observer . Even when the source is moving towards the observer , if there is a transverse component to the motion then there is some speed at which the <unk> just <unk> the expected <unk> and at higher speed the approaching source will be <unk> . 
 The <unk> consequences of this effect can be derived using the <unk> from general relativity that describe a <unk> and <unk> universe . 
 In general , the wavelength of light is not the same for the two positions and times considered due to the changing properties of the metric . When the wave was emitted , it had a wavelength <unk> . The next crest of the light wave was emitted at a time 
 The observer sees the next crest of the observed light wave with a wavelength <unk> to arrive at a time 
 For very small variations in time ( over the period of one cycle of a light wave ) the scale factor is essentially a constant ( a 
 is obtained . In an expanding universe such as the one we inhabit , the scale factor is <unk> increasing as time passes , thus , <unk> is positive and distant galaxies appear <unk> . 
 Using a model of the expansion of the Universe , <unk> can be related to the age of an observed object , the so @-@ called cosmic time – <unk> relation . <unk> a density ratio as <unk> : 
 with <unk> the critical density <unk> a universe that eventually <unk> from one that simply expands . This density is about three hydrogen atoms per thousand liters of space . At large <unk> one finds : 
 If the Universe were contracting instead of expanding , we would see distant galaxies <unk> by an amount proportional to their distance instead of <unk> . 
 r is the radial coordinate of the source ( which is analogous to the classical distance from the center of the object , but is actually a <unk> coordinate ) , and 
 This gravitational <unk> result can be derived from the assumptions of special relativity and the equivalence principle ; the full theory of general relativity is not required . 
 The effect is very small but measurable on Earth using the <unk> effect and was first observed in the Pound – <unk> experiment . However , it is significant near a black hole , and as an object approaches the event horizon the red shift becomes infinite . It is also the dominant cause of large angular @-@ scale temperature fluctuations in the cosmic <unk> background radiation ( see Sachs @-@ Wolfe effect ) . 
 The <unk> observed in astronomy can be measured because the emission and absorption spectra for atoms are distinctive and well known , <unk> from spectroscopic experiments in laboratories on Earth . When the <unk> of various absorption and emission lines from a single astronomical object is measured , <unk> is found to be remarkably constant . Although distant objects may be slightly blurred and lines <unk> , it is by no more than can be explained by thermal or mechanical motion of the source . For these reasons and others , the consensus among astronomers is that the <unk> they observe are due to some combination of the three established forms of <unk> @-@ like <unk> . Alternative hypotheses and explanations for <unk> such as tired light are not generally considered plausible . 
 <unk> , as a measurement , is considerably more difficult than simple <unk> , which measures the brightness of astronomical objects through certain <unk> . When photometric data is all that is available ( for example , the Hubble Deep Field and the Hubble <unk> Deep Field ) , astronomers rely on a technique for measuring photometric <unk> . Due to the broad wavelength ranges in photometric <unk> and the necessary assumptions about the nature of the spectrum at the light @-@ source , errors for these sorts of measurements can range up to <unk> 
 1 , it would be brightest in the infrared rather than at the yellow @-@ green color associated with the peak of its <unk> spectrum , and the light intensity will be reduced in the filter by a factor of four , ( 1 + <unk> ) 2 . Both the <unk> count rate and the <unk> energy are <unk> . ( See K correction for more details on the photometric consequences of <unk> . ) 
 The most distant objects exhibit larger <unk> corresponding to the Hubble flow of the Universe . The largest observed <unk> , corresponding to the greatest distance and <unk> back in time , is that of the cosmic <unk> background radiation ; the numerical value of its <unk> is about <unk> 
 0 corresponds to present time ) , and it shows the state of the Universe about 13 @.@ 8 billion years ago , and <unk> @,@ 000 years after the initial moments of the Big Bang . 
 The luminous point @-@ like cores of <unk> were the first " high @-@ <unk> " ( <unk> > 0 @.@ 1 ) objects discovered before the improvement of telescopes allowed for the discovery of other high @-@ <unk> galaxies . 
 The Hubble law 's linear relationship between distance and <unk> assumes that the rate of expansion of the Universe is constant . However , when the Universe was much younger , the expansion rate , and thus the Hubble " constant " , was larger than it is today . For more distant galaxies , then , whose light has been travelling to us for much longer times , the <unk> of constant expansion rate fails , and the Hubble law becomes a non @-@ linear integral relationship and dependent on the history of the expansion rate since the emission of the light from the galaxy in question . Observations of the <unk> @-@ distance relationship can be used , then , to determine the expansion history of the Universe and thus the matter and energy content . 
 While it was long believed that the expansion rate has been continuously decreasing since the Big Bang , recent observations of the <unk> @-@ distance relationship using Type <unk> supernovae have suggested that in comparatively recent times the expansion rate of the Universe has begun to accelerate . 
 Currently , the objects with the highest known <unk> are galaxies and the objects producing gamma ray bursts . The most reliable <unk> are from spectroscopic data , and the highest confirmed spectroscopic <unk> of a galaxy is that of <unk> @-@ <unk> , with a <unk> of <unk> 
 8 @.@ 6 , corresponding to 600 million years after the Big Bang . <unk> less reliable are <unk> @-@ break <unk> , the highest of which is the <unk> galaxy <unk> @-@ <unk> at a <unk> <unk> 
 7 @.@ 0 . The most distant observed gamma ray burst with a spectroscopic <unk> measurement was <unk> <unk> , which had a <unk> of <unk> 
 In June 2015 , astronomers reported evidence for Population III stars in the Cosmos <unk> 7 galaxy at <unk> = 
 6 @.@ 60 . Such stars are likely to have existed in the very early universe ( i.e. , at high <unk> ) , and may have started the production of chemical elements heavier than hydrogen that are needed for the later formation of planets and life as we know it . 
 With advent of automated telescopes and improvements in <unk> , a number of collaborations have been made to map the Universe in <unk> space . By combining <unk> with angular position data , a <unk> survey maps the 3D distribution of matter within a field of the sky . These observations are used to measure properties of the large @-@ scale structure of the Universe . The Great Wall , a vast <unk> of galaxies over 500 million light @-@ years wide , provides a dramatic example of a large @-@ scale structure that <unk> surveys can detect . 
 The interactions and phenomena summarized in the subjects of radiative transfer and physical optics can result in shifts in the wavelength and frequency of electromagnetic radiation . In such cases the shifts correspond to a physical energy transfer to matter or other photons rather than being due to a transformation between reference frames . These shifts can be due to such physical phenomena as <unk> effects or the scattering of electromagnetic radiation whether from charged elementary particles , from <unk> , or from fluctuations of the index of refraction in a <unk> medium as occurs in the radio phenomenon of radio <unk> . While such phenomena are sometimes referred to as " <unk> " and " <unk> " , in <unk> light @-@ matter interactions that result in energy shifts in the radiation field are generally referred to as " <unk> " rather than " <unk> " which , as a term , is normally reserved for the effects discussed above . 
 In many circumstances scattering causes radiation to <unk> because entropy results in the <unk> of many low @-@ energy photons over few high @-@ energy ones ( while <unk> total energy ) . Except possibly under carefully controlled conditions , scattering does not produce the same relative change in wavelength across the whole spectrum ; that is , any calculated <unk> is generally a function of wavelength . Furthermore , scattering from random media generally occurs at many angles , and <unk> is a function of the scattering angle . If multiple scattering occurs , or the scattering particles have relative motion , then there is generally distortion of spectral lines as well . 
 In interstellar astronomy , visible spectra can appear <unk> due to scattering processes in a phenomenon referred to as interstellar <unk> – similarly <unk> scattering causes the atmospheric <unk> of the Sun seen in the <unk> or sunset and causes the rest of the sky to have a blue color . This phenomenon is distinct from <unk> because the spectroscopic lines are not shifted to other <unk> in <unk> objects and there is an additional dimming and distortion associated with the phenomenon due to photons being scattered in and out of the line @-@ of @-@ sight .

 Trans @-@ Europe Express ( German : Trans Europa Express ) is the sixth studio album by German electronic music band <unk> . Recorded in mid @-@ 1976 in Düsseldorf , Germany , the album was released in March 1977 on <unk> <unk> Records . The album 's themes were influenced by friends who suggested writing songs about the Trans <unk> Express to reflect <unk> 's electronic music style . Critics have described the album as having two specific themes : celebration of Europe and the <unk> between reality and image . Musically , the songs on this album differ from the group 's earlier <unk> style with a focus on electronic mechanized rhythms , <unk> , and occasional manipulated vocals . 
 Trans @-@ Europe Express charted at 119 on the American charts and was placed number 30 on the Village Voice 's 1977 <unk> & <unk> critics poll . Two singles were released from Trans @-@ Europe Express : " Trans @-@ Europe Express " and " <unk> <unk> " . The album has been re @-@ released in several formats and continued to receive acclaim from modern critics . 
 After the release and tour for the album Radio @-@ <unk> , <unk> continued to move further away from their earlier <unk> style of improvised instrumental music , refining their work more into the format of melodic electronic songs . During the tour for Radio @-@ <unk> the band began to make performance rules such as not to be drunk on stage or at parties . Karl <unk> wrote that about these rules , stating that " it 's not easy to turn <unk> on a synthesizer if you are drunk or full of drugs . ... We always tried to keep very aware of what we were doing while acting in public . " During this tour , early melodies that would later evolve into the song " <unk> <unk> " were being performed . 
 An important piece of new equipment used on the album was the <unk> <unk> , a customized 32 @-@ step 16 @-@ channel <unk> <unk> made for the band by <unk> & <unk> . This allowed the construction of more elaborate sequenced synthesizer lines , which are featured prominently in the tracks " Europe <unk> " , " Franz Schubert " and " <unk> Endless " , and liberated the player from the <unk> of playing repetitive keyboard patterns . 
 Whereas Radio @-@ <unk> had featured a mixture of German and English lyrics throughout the album , Trans @-@ Europe Express went further and was mixed as two entirely separate versions , one sung in English , the other in German . At the recommendation of <unk> <unk> , a French version of the song " <unk> <unk> " , titled " Les <unk> " , was also recorded . " Les <unk> " was the group 's first song in French and would influence decisions to record songs in French on later albums . After recording the album in Düsseldorf , <unk> and Schneider visited Los Angeles to mix the tracks at the Record Plant Studio . Elements of the mixing sessions that were done in Los Angeles were dropped from the album , including the use of more <unk> vocals in order to do more mixing in Düsseldorf and Hamburg later . 
 The artwork for the album cover of Trans @-@ Europe Express was originally going to be a monochrome picture of the group reflected in a series of mirrors . This idea was dropped for a photo by New York @-@ based celebrity photographer Maurice Seymour , with the group dressed in suits to resemble <unk> . J. <unk> 's image of the group was taken in Paris and is a highly <unk> photo @-@ montage of <unk> from their shoulders up again posed as <unk> which is shown on the cover of the English version of the album . On the inside sleeve , a color <unk> of the group sitting at a small cafe table designed by Emil <unk> was used . The photo for this scene was from the session by Maurice Seymour , taken on the group 's American tour . Other photos were taken by <unk> that show the group laughing and smiling . These were not used for the album 's release . 
 Trans @-@ Europe Express was originally released in March 1977 . With the help of Günther <unk> , <unk> made a promotional music video for the song " Trans @-@ Europe Express " . The video features the group wearing long coats on a train trip from Düsseldorf to nearby <unk> . <unk> <unk> from this video were later used on the single sleeve for " <unk> <unk> " . <unk> would work with <unk> again on their album The Man @-@ Machine doing the photography for the album cover . To promote the album to the press in France , EMI Records hired a train with old fashioned carriages from the 1930s to travel from Paris to <unk> while the songs from the album were played over the train 's announcement system for the critics . 
 In October 2009 , a remastered edition of the album was released by EMI Records in Germany , <unk> Records in the European Union and <unk> Records in the United States . This re @-@ release was available on compact disc , digital download and vinyl and features a different album cover from previous versions of the album . This new version features a black background with white Trans <unk> Express train in the center . The track listing on the 2009 re @-@ release <unk> the titles of the songs to match the original German release . This change has " Metal on Metal " being credited for two minutes of the music with the remainder being a track titled " <unk> " ( English : " <unk> " ) . 
 Trans @-@ Europe Express charted higher in the United States than <unk> 's previous album Radio @-@ <unk> by peaking at number 117 on the Billboard Top <unk> & Tapes chart . " Trans @-@ Europe Express " and " <unk> <unk> " were released as singles from the album . " Trans @-@ Europe Express " charted in the Billboard Hot 100 in 1977 where it peaked at number 67 . Trans @-@ Europe Express began charting in the United Kingdom in the 1980s . The album entered the charts on February 6 , 1982 , staying in the charts for seven weeks and peaking at number 49 . The single for " <unk> <unk> " entered the charts on February 20 , 1982 , staying in the charts for five weeks and peaking at number 25 . 
 Initial reviews for the Trans @-@ Europe Express were positive . Music critic Robert Christgau gave the album an <unk> rating , stating that the album 's " <unk> effects sound like parodies by some cosmic schoolboy of every lush synthesizer surge that 's ever stuck in your <unk> — yet also work the way those <unk> are supposed to work " . Trans @-@ Europe Express charted in the Village Voice 's 1977 <unk> & <unk> critics poll , placing at number 30 . 
 Modern reception has been very favorable . Trans @-@ Europe Express has the highest possible ratings from publications including AllMusic , <unk> , Rolling Stone and Slant Magazine . Steve Huey of Allmusic wrote that the album " is often cited as perhaps the <unk> ( and most accessible ) <unk> album ... Overall , Trans @-@ Europe Express offers the best blend of <unk> , mechanized rhythms , and crafted , catchy melodies in the group 's catalog " . The British press also looked favorably on the album . Q gave the album four stars out of five , stating that the album " changed the face of American dance music " and that it was one of the most compelling beats of this or any other era " . In 2009 <unk> in Sound gave the album a perfect rating of 10 out of 10 , stating that " Trans @-@ Europe Express is all at once antique , <unk> , retro and contemporary . Its status as modern electronic music 's birth certificate is well @-@ earned , but its <unk> reputation should never be allowed to disguise its true value and power as a work of art . Nor should it obscure a longevity that , 32 years on , we might as well start calling by its real name : immortality " . 
 Trans @-@ Europe Express has also appeared on top album lists from a variety of sources . In 2001 , TV network VH1 placed Trans @-@ Europe Express at number 56 on their list of " 100 Greatest Albums ( of Rock & Roll ) of All Time " . In 2002 , Slant Magazine placed the album at number one on their list of the greatest electronic albums of the 20th century . In 2003 , Rolling Stone placed the album at number 253 on their list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time . Channel 4 placed the album at number 71 on their list of top 100 Greatest albums . In 2004 , the online music website Pitchfork Media listed Trans @-@ Europe Express as 6th best album of the 1970s , stating that " the day will soon come , if it hasn 't already , that Trans @-@ Europe Express joins the ranks of Sgt. <unk> 's <unk> Hearts Club Band and <unk> on Main Street as a record that simply cannot be written about " . 
 Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine described the album 's influence as " unprecedented , reaching as wide as rock ( <unk> 's Kid A ) , hip @-@ hop ( <unk> <unk> 's classic " Planet Rock " , Jay Dee 's recent " Big <unk> Express " ) and pop ( Madonna 's <unk> World Tour , which incorporated samples of " Metal on Metal " ) " . 
 In the late 1970s , the album had an impact on post @-@ punk band Joy Division as bassist Peter Hook related it : " We were introduced to <unk> by [ singer ] Ian Curtis , who insisted we play Trans Europe Express before we went on stage every time . The tape was played in the venue over the PA system , to be heard by everyone . The first time was <unk> [ a Manchester club well known for its ‘ Bowie Room ’ ] . Ian got thrown out for kicking glass around the dance floor in time to the track . It took us ages of pleading to get him back in . " Drummer Stephen Morris also confirmed that Joy Division " used to play Trans @-@ Europe Express before we went on stage , to get us into the zone . It worked because it gets up a lot of momentum . Trans @-@ Europe Express just seemed to express an optimism - even if people see it as machine music " . Morris also said : " It reminds me of <unk> , the film , with all of the 1920s singing . [ ... ] When you get that marriage between humans and machines , and you get it right , it 's fantastic . I have to say it 's my favourite <unk> album . " 
 The information regarding accolades attributed to Trans @-@ Europe Express is adapted from <unk> Music , except where otherwise noted . 
 ^ [ a ] While " <unk> " ( English meaning " trigger " or " departure " ) appeared originally as a separate track on all pressings of Trans Europa Express , later releases of Trans @-@ Europe Express combined " <unk> " and " Metal on Metal " together under the latter track 's title , at a running time of 6 : 52 . On both 2009 <unk> of Trans Europa Express and Trans @-@ Europe Express , however , " <unk> " is presented as a separate track . 
 García Márquez started as a journalist , and wrote many acclaimed non @-@ fiction works and short stories , but is best known for his novels , such as One Hundred Years of Solitude ( 1967 ) , The Autumn of the Patriarch ( 1975 ) , and Love in the Time of Cholera ( 1985 ) . His works have achieved significant critical acclaim and widespread commercial success , most notably for popularizing a literary style labeled as magic realism , which uses magical elements and events in otherwise ordinary and realistic situations . Some of his works are set in a fictional village called <unk> ( the town mainly inspired by his birthplace <unk> ) , and most of them explore the theme of solitude . 
 On his death in April 2014 , Juan Manuel Santos , the President of Colombia , described him as " the greatest Colombian who ever lived . " 
 Since García Márquez 's parents were more or less strangers to him for the first few years of his life , his grandparents influenced his early development very strongly . His grandfather , whom he called " <unk> " , was a Liberal veteran of the Thousand Days War . The Colonel was considered a hero by Colombian Liberals and was highly respected . He was well known for his refusal to remain silent about the banana massacres that took place the year after García Márquez was born . The Colonel , whom García Márquez described as his " <unk> <unk> with history and reality , " was also an excellent storyteller . He taught García Márquez lessons from the dictionary , took him to the circus each year , and was the first to introduce his grandson to ice — a " miracle " found at the United Fruit Company store . He would also occasionally tell his young grandson " You can 't imagine how much a dead man weighs " , reminding him that there was no greater burden than to have killed a man , a lesson that García Márquez would later integrate into his novels . 
 García Márquez 's political and ideological views were shaped by his grandfather 's stories . In an interview , García Márquez told his friend <unk> <unk> Mendoza , " my grandfather the Colonel was a Liberal . My political ideas probably came from him to begin with because , instead of telling me fairy tales when I was young , he would <unk> me with <unk> accounts of the last civil war that free @-@ thinkers and anti @-@ clerics <unk> against the Conservative government . " This influenced his political views and his literary technique so that " in the same way that his writing career initially took shape in conscious opposition to the Colombian literary status <unk> , García Márquez 's socialist and anti @-@ <unk> views are in <unk> opposition to the global status <unk> dominated by the United States . " 
 García Márquez 's grandmother , Doña <unk> <unk> <unk> , played an equally influential role in his upbringing . He was inspired by the way she " treated the extraordinary as something perfectly natural . " The house was filled with stories of ghosts and <unk> , <unk> and <unk> , all of which were <unk> ignored by her husband . According to García Márquez she was " the source of the magical , superstitious and supernatural view of reality " . He enjoyed his grandmother 's unique way of telling stories . No matter how fantastic or <unk> her statements , she always delivered them as if they were the <unk> truth . It was a deadpan style that , some thirty years later , heavily influenced her grandson 's most popular novel , One Hundred Years of Solitude . 
 García Márquez began his career as a journalist while studying law at the National University of Colombia . In 1948 and 1949 he wrote for El Universal in Cartagena . Later , from 1950 until 1952 , he wrote a " whimsical " column under the name of " <unk> " for the local paper El <unk> in <unk> . García Márquez noted of his time at El <unk> , " I 'd write a piece and they 'd pay me three pesos for it , and maybe an editorial for another three . " During this time he became an active member of the informal group of writers and journalists known as the <unk> Group , an association that provided great motivation and inspiration for his literary career . He worked with inspirational figures such as Ramon <unk> , whom García Márquez depicted as an Old Catalan who owns a bookstore in One Hundred Years of Solitude . At this time , García Márquez was also introduced to the works of writers such as Virginia Woolf and William Faulkner . Faulkner 's narrative techniques , historical themes and use of rural locations influenced many Latin American authors . The environment of <unk> gave García Márquez a world @-@ class literary education and provided him with a unique perspective on Caribbean culture . From 1954 to 1955 , García Márquez spent time in Bogotá and regularly wrote for Bogotá 's El <unk> . He was a regular film critic which drove his interest in film . 
 In December 1957 García Márquez accepted a position in <unk> in the newspaper El <unk> . He arrived to the Venezuelan capital on 23 December 1957 , and began working right away at El <unk> . García Márquez also assisted in the 1958 Venezuelan coup d 'état , leading to the exile of the president Marcos Pérez <unk> . Following this event , García Márquez wrote an article , " The participation of the clergy in the struggle " , describing the Church of Venezuela opposition against <unk> 's regime . In March 1958 he made a trip to Colombia , where he married Mercedes <unk> and together they came back to <unk> . In May 1958 , <unk> with the owner of <unk> , he resigned and became shortly afterwards editor of the newspaper Venezuela <unk> . 
 Ending in controversy , his last domestically written editorial for El <unk> was a series of fourteen news articles in which he revealed the hidden story of how a Colombian Navy vessel 's <unk> " occurred because the boat contained a badly <unk> cargo of <unk> goods that broke loose on the deck . " García Márquez compiled this story through interviews with a young sailor who survived the <unk> . The publication of the articles resulted in public controversy , as they discredited the official account of the events , which had blamed a storm for the <unk> , and <unk> the surviving sailor . 
 In response to this controversy El <unk> sent García Márquez away to Europe to be a foreign correspondent . He wrote about his experiences for El <unk> , a newspaper which had briefly replaced El <unk> during the military government of General <unk> <unk> <unk> and was later shut down by Colombian authorities . García Márquez 's background in journalism provided a <unk> base for his writing career . Literary critic Bell @-@ <unk> noted , " Owing to his hands on experiences in journalism , García Márquez is , of all the great living authors , the one who is closest to everyday reality . " 
 García Márquez was one of the original founders of <unk> , a <unk> that aired between 1992 and 1997 . He was attracted to the project by the promise of editorial and <unk> independence . 
 García Márquez met Mercedes <unk> while she was at school ; they decided to wait for her to finish before getting married . When he was sent to Europe as a foreign correspondent , Mercedes waited for him to return to <unk> . Finally they married in 1958 . The following year , their first son , <unk> García , now a television and film director , was born . In 1961 , the family traveled by <unk> bus throughout the southern United States and eventually settled in Mexico City . García Márquez had always wanted to see the Southern United States because it inspired the writings of William Faulkner . Three years later the couple 's second son , <unk> , was born in Mexico . <unk> is currently a graphic designer in Mexico City . 
 Leaf Storm ( La <unk> ) is García Márquez 's first novella and took seven years to find a publisher , finally being published in 1955 . García Márquez notes that " of all that he had written ( as of 1973 ) , Leaf Storm was his favorite because he felt that it was the most sincere and spontaneous . " All the events of the novella take place in one room , during a half @-@ hour period on Wednesday 12 September 1928 . It is the story of an old colonel ( similar to García Márquez 's own grandfather ) who tries to give a proper Christian burial to an unpopular French doctor . The colonel is supported only by his daughter and grandson . The novella explores the child 's first experience with death by following his stream of consciousness . The book also reveals the perspective of Isabel , the Colonel 's daughter , which provides a feminine point of view . 
 This novel was widely popular and led to García Márquez 's Nobel Prize as well as the <unk> <unk> Prize in 1972 . William Kennedy has called it " the first piece of literature since the Book of Genesis that should be required reading for the entire human race , " and hundreds of articles and books of literary critique have been published in response to it . Despite the many accolades the book received , García Márquez tended to <unk> its success . He once remarked : " Most critics don 't realize that a novel like One Hundred Years of Solitude is a bit of a joke , full of signals to close friends ; and so , with some pre @-@ ordained right to <unk> they take on the responsibility of <unk> the book and risk making terrible fools of themselves . " 
 Due to his newfound fame and his outspoken views on U.S. imperialism Garcia Márquez was labeled as a <unk> and for many years was denied <unk> by U.S. immigration authorities . After Bill Clinton was elected U.S. president , he lifted the travel ban and cited One Hundred Years of Solitude as his favorite novel . 
 García Márquez was inspired to write a dictator novel when he witnessed the flight of Venezuelan dictator Marcos Pérez <unk> . He shares , " it was the first time we had seen a dictator fall in Latin America . " García Márquez began writing Autumn of the Patriarch ( El <unk> del <unk> ) in 1968 and said it was finished in 1971 ; however , he continued to <unk> the dictator novel until 1975 when it was published in Spain . According to García Márquez , the novel is a " poem on the solitude of power " as it follows the life of an eternal dictator known as the General . The novel is developed through a series of anecdotes related to the life of the General , which do not appear in chronological order . Although the exact location of the story is not pin @-@ pointed in the novel , the imaginary country is situated somewhere in the Caribbean . 
 My intention was always to make a synthesis of all the Latin American <unk> , but especially those from the Caribbean . Nevertheless , the personality of Juan Vicente Gomez [ of Venezuela ] was so strong , in addition to the fact that he exercised a special fascination over me , that undoubtedly the Patriarch has much more of him than anyone else . 
 After Autumn of the Patriarch was published García Márquez and his family moved from Barcelona to Mexico City and García Márquez pledged not to publish again until the Chilean Dictator Augusto Pinochet was deposed . However , he ultimately published Chronicle of a Death <unk> while Pinochet was still in power as he " could not remain silent in the face of injustice and repression . " 
 The plot of the novel revolves around Santiago <unk> 's murder . The narrator acts as a detective , uncovering the events of the murder second by second . Literary critic <unk> <unk> notes that the story " <unk> in an inverted fashion . Instead of moving forward ... the plot moves backwards . " In the first chapter , the narrator tells the reader exactly who killed Santiago <unk> and the rest of the book is left to unfold why . 
 Chronicle of a Death <unk> was published in 1981 , the year before García Márquez was awarded the 1982 Nobel Prize in Literature . The novel was also adapted into a film by Italian director Francesco <unk> in 1987 . 
 Love in the Time of Cholera ( El <unk> en los <unk> del <unk> ) was first published in 1985 . It is considered a non @-@ traditional love story as " lovers find love in their ' golden years ' — in their <unk> , when death is all around them " . 
 Love in the Time of Cholera is based on the stories of two couples . The young love of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> is based on the love affair of García Márquez 's parents . However , as García Márquez explains in an interview : “ The only difference is [ my parents ] married . And as soon as they were married , they were no longer interesting as literary figures . " The love of old people is based on a newspaper story about the death of two Americans , who were almost 80 years old , who met every year in Acapulco . They were out in a boat one day and were murdered by the <unk> with his oars . García Márquez notes , " Through their death , the story of their secret romance became known . I was fascinated by them . They were each married to other people . " 
 In 2002 , García Márquez published the memoir <unk> para <unk> , the first of a projected three @-@ volume autobiography . Edith Grossman 's English translation , Living to Tell the Tale , was published in November 2003 . October 2004 brought the publication of a novel , Memories of My Melancholy <unk> ( <unk> de mis <unk> <unk> ) , a love story that follows the romance of a 90 @-@ year @-@ old man and a <unk> concubine . Memories of My Melancholy <unk> caused controversy in Iran , where it was banned after an initial 5 @,@ 000 copies were printed and sold . 
 García Márquez also originally wrote his <unk> as a third screenplay . However , this version was lost and replaced by the novella . Nonetheless , he worked on <unk> the script in collaboration with Ruy <unk> and the film was released in Mexico in 1983 . 
 British director Mike Newell ( Four <unk> and a <unk> ) filmed Love in the Time of Cholera in Cartagena , Colombia , with the screenplay written by Ronald <unk> ( The <unk> ) . The film was released in the U.S. on 16 November 2007 . 
 His novel Of Love and Other Demons was adapted and directed by a Costa <unk> filmmaker , Hilda Hidalgo , who is a graduate of the Film Institute at Havana where García Márquez would frequently <unk> screenplay workshops . Hidalgo 's film was released in April 2010 . The same novel was adapted by Hungarian composer <unk> <unk> to form the opera Love and Other Demons , premiered in 2008 at <unk> Festival . 
 In 1999 , García Márquez was diagnosed with <unk> cancer . <unk> provided by a hospital in Los Angeles proved to be successful , and the illness went into remission . This event prompted García Márquez to begin writing his memoirs : " I reduced relations with my friends to a minimum , <unk> the telephone , canceled the trips and all sorts of current and future plans " , he told El <unk> , the Colombian newspaper , " ... and locked myself in to write every day without <unk> . " In 2002 , three years later , he published Living to Tell the Tale ( <unk> para <unk> ) , the first volume in a projected trilogy of memoirs . 
 In 2000 , his impending death was incorrectly reported by Peruvian daily newspaper La <unk> . The next day other newspapers republished his alleged farewell poem , " La <unk> , " but shortly afterwards García Márquez denied being the author of the poem , which was determined to be the work of a Mexican <unk> . 
 He stated that 2005 " was the first [ year ] in my life in which I haven 't written even a line . With my experience , I could write a new novel without any problems , but people would realise my heart wasn 't in it . " 
 In May 2008 , it was announced that García Márquez was finishing a new " novel of love " that had yet to be given a title , to be published by the end of the year . However , in April 2009 his agent , Carmen <unk> , told the Chilean newspaper La <unk> that García Márquez was unlikely to write again . This was disputed by Random House <unk> editor <unk> <unk> , who stated that García Márquez was completing a new novel called We 'll Meet in August ( <unk> <unk> nos <unk> ) . 
 In December 2008 , García Márquez told fans at the <unk> book fair that writing had worn him out . In 2009 , responding to claims by both his literary agent and his biographer that his writing career was over , he told Colombian newspaper El <unk> : " Not only is it not true , but the only thing I do is write " . 
 In April 2014 , García Márquez was hospitalized in Mexico . He had infections in his lungs and his urinary tract , and was suffering from <unk> . He was responding well to antibiotics . Mexican president Enrique <unk> <unk> wrote on Twitter , " I wish him a <unk> recovery " . Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos said his country was thinking of the author and said in a <unk> " All of Colombia wishes a <unk> recovery to the greatest of all time : Gabriel García Márquez " . 
 García Márquez died of pneumonia at the age of 87 on 17 April 2014 in Mexico City . His death was confirmed by his relative <unk> <unk> on Twitter , and by his former editor <unk> <unk> . 
 The Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos mentioned : " One Hundred Years of Solitude and sadness for the death of the greatest Colombian of all time " . The former Colombian president Álvaro <unk> <unk> said : " Master García Márquez , thanks forever , millions of people in the planet fell in love with our nation fascinated with your lines " . At the time of his death , he had a wife and two sons . 
 Garcia <unk> was <unk> at a private family ceremony in Mexico City . On 22 April , the presidents of Colombia and Mexico attended a formal ceremony in Mexico City , where Garcia <unk> had lived for more than three decades . A funeral <unk> took the urn containing his ashes from his house to the <unk> de <unk> <unk> , where the memorial ceremony was held . Earlier , residents in his home town of <unk> in Colombia 's Caribbean region held a symbolic funeral . 
 While there are certain aspects readers can almost always expect in García Márquez 's writing , like instances of humour , he did not stick to any clear and predetermined style template . In an interview with <unk> <unk> , García Márquez noted : 
 In every book I try to make a different path [ ... ] . One doesn 't choose the style . You can investigate and try to discover what the best style would be for a theme . But the style is determined by the subject , by the mood of the times . If you try to use something that is not suitable , it just won 't work . Then the critics build theories around that and they see things I hadn 't seen . I only respond to our way of life , the life of the Caribbean . 
 García Márquez was also noted for leaving out seemingly important details and events so the reader is forced into a more <unk> role in the story development . For example , in No One <unk> to the Colonel , the main characters are not given names . This practice is influenced by Greek <unk> , such as <unk> and <unk> Rex , in which important events occur off @-@ stage and are left to the audience 's imagination . 
 Reality is an important theme in all of García Márquez 's works . He said of his early works ( with the exception of Leaf Storm ) , " Nobody <unk> to the Colonel , In Evil Hour , and Big Mama 's <unk> all reflect the reality of life in Colombia and this theme determines the rational structure of the books . I don 't regret having written them , but they belong to a kind of <unk> literature that offers too static and exclusive a vision of reality . " 
 " The way you treat reality in your books ... has been called magical realism . I have the feeling your European readers are usually aware of the magic of your stories but fail to see the reality behind it ... . " " This is surely because their <unk> prevents them seeing that reality isn 't limited to the price of tomatoes and eggs . " 
 The theme of solitude runs through much of García Márquez 's works . As <unk> notes , " Love in the Time of Cholera , like all of Gabriel García Márquez 's work , explores the solitude of the individual and of humankind ... portrayed through the solitude of love and of being in love " . 
 In response to <unk> <unk> Mendoza 's question , " If solitude is the theme of all your books , where should we look for the roots of this over @-@ riding emotion ? In your childhood perhaps ? " García Márquez replied , " I think it 's a problem everybody has . Everyone has his own way and means of expressing it . The feeling <unk> the work of so many writers , although some of them may express it <unk> . " 
 In his Nobel Prize acceptance speech , Solitude of Latin America , he relates this theme of solitude to the Latin American experience , " The interpretation of our reality through patterns not our own , serves only to make us ever more unknown , ever less free , ever more solitary . " 
 In his autobiography , García Márquez explains his fascination with the word and concept <unk> . He describes a trip he made with his mother back to <unk> as a young man : 
 The train stopped at a station that had no town , and a short while later it passed the only banana plantation along the route that had its name written over the gate : <unk> . This word had attracted my attention ever since the first trips I had made with my grandfather , but I discovered only as an adult that I liked its poetic resonance . I never heard anyone say it and did not even ask myself what it meant ... I happened to read in an <unk> that it is a tropical tree resembling the <unk> . 
 In several of García Márquez 's works , including No One <unk> to the Colonel , In Evil Hour , and Leaf Storm , he referenced La <unk> ( the violence ) , " a brutal civil war between <unk> and <unk> that lasted into the 1960s , causing the deaths of several hundred thousand <unk> " . Throughout all of his novels there are subtle references to la <unk> . For example , characters live under various unjust situations like curfew , press censorship , and underground newspapers . In Evil Hour , while not one of García Márquez 's most famous novels , is notable for its portrayal of la <unk> with its " fragmented portrayal of social disintegration provoked by la <unk> " . Although García Márquez did portray the corrupt nature and the <unk> of times like la <unk> , he refused to use his work as a platform for political propaganda . " For him , the duty of the revolutionary writer is to write well , and the ideal novel is one that moves its reader by its political and social content , and , at the same time , by its power to penetrate reality and expose its other side . 
 Whether in fiction or <unk> , in the epic novel or the concentrated story , Márquez is now recognized in the words of Carlos <unk> as " the most popular and perhaps the best writer in Spanish since <unk> " . He is one of those very rare artists who succeed in <unk> not only a nation 's life , culture and history , but also those of an entire continent , and a master storyteller who , as The New York Review of Books once said , " forces upon us at every page the wonder and extravagance of life . " 
 García Márquez 's work is an important part of the Latin American Boom of literature . His work has challenged critics of Colombian literature to step out of the conservative criticism that had been dominant before the success of One Hundred Years of Solitude . In a review of literary criticism Robert <unk> notes , 
 García Márquez continues to cast a lengthy shadow in Colombia , Latin America , and the United States . Critical works on the 1982 Nobel laureate have reached industrial proportion and show no signs of <unk> . Moreover , García Márquez has galvanized Colombian literature in an unprecedented way by giving a tremendous <unk> to Colombian literature . Indeed , he has become a <unk> for literature and criticism throughout the Americas as his work has created a certain attraction @-@ <unk> among critics and writers while readers continue to <unk> new publications . No one can deny that García Márquez has helped <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> literature and criticism in Colombia and the rest of Latin America . 
 García Márquez received the Nobel Prize in Literature on 8 December 1982 " for his novels and short stories , in which the fantastic and the realistic are combined in a richly composed world of imagination , reflecting a continent 's life and conflicts " . His acceptance speech was entitled " The Solitude of Latin America " . García Márquez was the first Colombian and fourth Latin American to win a Nobel Prize for Literature . After becoming a Nobel laureate , García Márquez stated to a correspondent : " I have the impression that in giving me the prize , they have taken into account the literature of the sub @-@ continent and have awarded me as a way of <unk> all of this literature " . 
 A year after his death , García Márquez appears as a notable character in <unk> <unk> 's novel Cartagena , set in Uruguay and Colombia 
 In Dexter ( season 3 ) , episode 10 ( " Go Your Own Way " ) , the title character gains access to Miguel <unk> 's personal study by telling <unk> 's housekeeper , <unk> , he wants to give <unk> a best man gift of a García Márquez limited edition book <unk> doesn 't already have , that Dexter needs to see which books are already in <unk> 's library , and <unk> should keep the gift and visit a secret . 
 In John Green 's famous novel " Looking for Alaska " , Gabriel García Márquez is mentioned several times . 
 " <unk> " is a song written by Ray Davies and performed by English rock band the <unk> on their album <unk> <unk> <unk> and the <unk> , Part One . The song details a romantic encounter between a young man and a possible <unk> , whom he meets in a club in <unk> , London . In the song , the narrator describes his confusion towards a person named <unk> who " walked like a woman and talked like a man " . Although Ray Davies claims that the incident was inspired by a true encounter experienced by the band 's manager , alternate explanations for the song have been given by drummer Mick <unk> . 
 The song was released in the United Kingdom on 12 June 1970 , while in the United States it was released on 28 June 1970 . <unk> , the single reached number two on the UK Singles Chart and number nine on the Billboard Hot 100 . Due to its controversial subject matter and use of the brand name Coca @-@ Cola , the single received backlash and even <unk> in Britain and Australia . The British version of the song uses the phrase " cherry <unk> " while the US version uses the name " Coca @-@ Cola . " The track has since become one of The <unk> ' most iconic and popular songs , later being ranked number 422 on " Rolling Stone 's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time " as well as number 473 on the " NME 's 500 Greatest Songs Of All Time " list . 
 Since its release , " <unk> " has appeared on multiple compilation and live albums . In 1980 , a live version of the song from the album One for the Road was released as a single in America and some European countries , becoming a minor hit . Other versions include live renditions from 1972 's Everybody 's in Show @-@ <unk> and 1996 's To the Bone . The " <unk> " character also made an appearance in the lyrics of the band 's 1981 song , " Destroyer " . 
 Ray Davies has claimed that he was inspired to write " <unk> " after <unk> manager Robert <unk> spent a night in Paris dancing with a <unk> woman . Davies said of the incident , " In his apartment , Robert had been dancing with this black woman , and he said , ' I 'm really onto a thing here . ' And it was okay until we left at six in the morning and then I said , ' Have you seen the <unk> ? ' He said ' Yeah , ' but he was too <unk> [ intoxicated ] to care , I think . " 
 Despite claims that the song was written about a supposed date between Ray Davies and trans woman actress Candy Darling , Davies has since claimed this <unk> to be false , saying that the two only went out to dinner together and that he had known the whole time of Darling 's gender identity . 
 In his autobiography , Dave Davies said that he came up with the music for what would become " <unk> " , noting that brother Ray added the lyrics after hearing it . In a 1990 interview , Dave Davies claimed that " <unk> " was written in a similar fashion to ' You Really Got Me ' in that the two worked on Ray 's basic skeleton of the song , saying that the song was more of a collaborative effort than many believed . 
 Written in April 1970 , " <unk> " was cited by Ray Davies as the first song he wrote following a break he took to act in the 1970 Play for Today film The Long <unk> Piano Player . Davies said that he had initially struggled with writing an opening that would sell the song , but the rest of the song " came naturally . " 
 Initial recordings of the song began in April 1970 , but , as the band 's bassist John <unk> remembered , recording for " <unk> " took particularly long , stretching into the next month . During April , four to five versions were attempted , utilizing different keys as well as varying beginnings and styles . In May , new piano parts were added to the backing track by John <unk> , the band 's new piano player that had just been auditioned . Vocals were also added at this time . The song was then mixed during that month . Mick <unk> remembered the recording sessions for the song positively , saying that it " was fun , as it was the Baptist 's [ John <unk> 's ] first recording with us . " 
 The guitar opening on the song was produced as a result of combining the sound of a Martin guitar and a vintage <unk> <unk> guitar . Ray Davies cited this blend of guitar sounds for the song 's unique guitar sound . 
 Despite the chart success " <unk> " would achieve , its fellow <unk> vs. <unk> track " <unk> " was initially considered to be the first single from the album . However , " <unk> " , which Ray Davies later claimed was an attempt to write a hit , was eventually decided on as the debut single release . 
 " <unk> " was released as a single in 1970 . In the UK , the B @-@ side to the single was the <unk> Are the Village Green Preservation Society <unk> " Berkeley <unk> " while the Dave Davies @-@ penned " <unk> Child of <unk> " was used in the US . It became an unexpected chart smash for the <unk> , reaching number two in Britain and number nine in the United States . The single also saw success worldwide , reaching the top of the charts in Ireland , New Zealand , and South Africa , as well as the top 5 in Germany , Austria , Belgium , and Switzerland . The success of the single had important ramifications for the band 's career at a critical time , allowing them to negotiate a new contract with RCA Records , construct their own London Studio , and assume more creative and managerial control . In a 1970 interview , Dave Davies claimed that , if " <unk> " had been a failure , the band would have " gone on making records for another year or so and then drifted apart . " 
 Although the track was a major hit for the band , Dave Davies did not enjoy the success of " <unk> " , saying , " In fact , when ' <unk> ' was a hit , it made me feel a bit uncomfortable . Because it was taking us out of a different sort of comfort zone , where we 'd been getting into the work , and the writing and the <unk> was more thought about . It did have that smell of : ' Oh <unk> , not that again . ' I found it a bit odd , that period . And then it got <unk> and <unk> . " Mick <unk> said that he " enjoyed the success " the band had with " <unk> " and its follow @-@ up , " <unk> . " 
 Originally , " <unk> " received backlash for its controversial lyrics . <unk> of censorship began to arise , with some radio stations fading the track out before <unk> 's biological sex was revealed . On 18 November 1970 , the song was even banned in Australia because of " controversial subject matter . " In a then @-@ current Record Mirror article entitled " Sex Change Record : <unk> <unk> " , Ray Davies refused to tell <unk> 's biological sex , saying , " It really doesn 't matter what sex <unk> is , I think she 's <unk> . " 
 Despite its subject matter , the BBC banned the track for a different reason . The original song recorded in <unk> had the word " Coca @-@ Cola " in the lyrics , but because of BBC Radio 's policy against product placement , Ray Davies was forced to make a round @-@ trip flight from New York to London and back — <unk> the band 's American tour — to change those words to the generic " cherry <unk> " for the single release . 
 " <unk> " received positive reviews from critics . Upon the single 's release , the NME praised the song as " an engaging and sparkling piece with a gay Latin flavour and a catchy hook chorus . " Billboard said of the song at the time of its US release , " Currently a top ten British chart winner , this infectious rhythm item has all the ingredients to put the <unk> right back up the Hot 100 here with solid impact . " Rolling Stone critic Paul <unk> called the song as " brilliant and a smash . " Music critic Robert Christgau , despite his mixed opinion on the <unk> vs. <unk> album , praised the single as " <unk> . " Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic lauded the song for " its <unk> , muscular sound , pitched halfway between acoustic folk and hard rock . " Ultimate Classic Rock ranked " <unk> " as The <unk> ' third best song , saying " the great guitar riff that feeds the song is one of Dave 's all @-@ time greatest . " Paste Magazine listed the track as the band 's fourth best song . 
 The song was also well @-@ liked by the band . Mick <unk> , who noted the song as one of the songs he was most proud to be associated with , said " I always liked ' <unk> ' , I liked the subject . It 's not like anything else . I liked it for that . We 'd always take a different path . " In a 1983 interview , Ray Davies said , " I 'm just very pleased I recorded it and more pleased I wrote it . " The band revisited the " <unk> " character in the lyrics of their 1981 song , " Destroyer " , a minor chart hit in America . 
 <unk> artist " Weird Al " Yankovic created a parody of the song called " <unk> " , featuring lyrics about the Star Wars character of the same name , on his 1985 album Dare to Be Stupid . 
 Since its release , " <unk> " became a mainstay in The <unk> ' live repertoire , appearing in the majority of the band 's subsequent set @-@ lists until the group 's break @-@ up . In 1972 , a live performance of the song recorded at Carnegie Hall in New York City appeared on the live half of the band 's 1972 album , Everybody 's in Show @-@ <unk> , a double @-@ LP which contained half new studio compositions and half live versions of previously released songs . 
 A live version of " <unk> " , recorded on 23 September 1979 in Providence , Rhode Island , was released as a single in the US in July 1980 to promote the live album One for the Road . The B @-@ side was the live version of " <unk> Heroes " . The single was a moderate success , reaching number 81 on the Billboard Hot 100 . It was also released in some countries in Europe ( although not the UK ) in April 1981 . It topped the charts in both the Netherlands , matching the number one peak of the original version , and in Belgium , where it exceeded the original 's peak of three . It also charted in Australia , peaking at number 69 and spending 22 weeks on the charts . Although not released as a stand @-@ alone single in the UK , it was included on a bonus single ( backed with a live version of " David Watts " from the same album ) with initial copies of " Better Things " in June 1981 . This live rendition , along with the live versions of " <unk> Heroes " and " You Really Got Me " from the same album , also appeared on the 1986 compilation album Come Dancing with The <unk> : The Best of the <unk> 1977 – 1986 . 
 Although it did not appear on the original 1994 version , another live version of " <unk> " was included on the 1996 US double @-@ album release of To the Bone , the band 's final release of new material before their dissolution . 
 The <unk> was navigable until 1971 , when improvements to the pumping station led to the entrance lock being removed . It is currently being upgraded to navigable status by the Environment Agency , as part of the <unk> Waterways Link , with a new entrance lock being completed in December 2008 , giving access to the first 12 miles ( 19 km ) of the drain , and the upgrading of the southern section , including a link to the River Glen to allow navigation to <unk> forming phase 2 of the project . 
 The Lincolnshire <unk> are an area of low @-@ lying land which have been subject to flooding and attempts to prevent it for centuries . In medieval times , the <unk> <unk> was built to drain the area , but by 1500 , this was regarded less as a drain for the land than as a boundary marker between the Parts of Holland and the Parts of Kesteven , two of the three medieval subdivisions of Lincolnshire which functioned as county councils until their abolition in 1974 . The first serious attempt to drain the area to the south west of Boston , now known as the Black <unk> Area but formerly known as the Lindsey Level , was from <unk> to 1638 , when the Earl of Lindsey agreed with the Commissioners of <unk> for Lincolnshire to carry out drainage works which would make 36 @,@ 000 acres ( 150 km2 ) of land available for agricultural use . The Earl and a group of <unk> paid for the works , in return for land grants . 
 On the River <unk> , the Grand <unk> was constructed and opened on 15 October 1766 , and this prevented <unk> water from entering the river , and hence flooding the Holland <unk> . The Boston Harbour Commissioners were created by the Boston Port Act 1766 , and they carried out improvement works to The Haven , which resulted in lower water levels at the Black <unk> , and hence more efficient draining from the South Forty @-@ Foot <unk> . Water was pumped into the drain by a series of <unk> driving <unk> wheels . Maps of the area produced in 1783 by Edward <unk> show 46 such mills , which provided drainage for 32 @,@ 000 acres ( 130 km2 ) of agricultural land . Extreme high tides in 1810 and again in 1820 resulted in widespread flooding , and further thought was given to improving the flood defences . 
 With the improvements to the River <unk> , the final section of Earl <unk> 's drain to <unk> <unk> was filled in , and the channel was diverted to join the South Forty @-@ Foot <unk> . <unk> the North Forty @-@ Foot <unk> , it now supplies Cook 's Lock and Holland <unk> pumping stations . 
 Despite all the improvements , serious flooding occurred in 1999 when the bank of the drain was breached near <unk> . Staff from the Environment Agency and the Black <unk> Internal Drainage Board successfully repaired the breach before properties were flooded , and a review of the flood defences was then carried out . The report recommended improvements to some of the banks , but funding for the work was not available , and so no work was done at the time . 
 The South Forty @-@ Foot <unk> serves as a district boundary over the length where it runs roughly south to north . South of <unk> High Bridge , the <unk> separates South Kesteven to the west from South Holland to the east . The boundary then continues southwards along the River Glen . North of <unk> , the boundary between the borough of Boston to the east and North Kesteven to the west follows the line of the <unk> . As the <unk> crosses the line of the <unk> <unk> , just before the Nottingham to Boston railway joins it at Great Hale pumping station , the boundary turns northwards , following its medieval course . 
 The South Forty @-@ Foot <unk> and the Black <unk> pumping station , together with most of the side channels which run into the drain are the responsibility of the Environment Agency . Management of the drainage ditches which drain the <unk> are the responsibility of the Black <unk> Internal Drainage Board , who maintain 34 pumping stations and three gravity stations in the region . Of these , 21 are situated on the banks of the <unk> , and pump directly into it , while one , the Black Hole <unk> pumping station , is constructed over the channel , and acts as a boundary between the part of the <unk> managed by the Environment Agency , and that managed by the Drainage Board . 
 Prior to 1971 , the <unk> had been navigable , but this privilege was removed at that time . It is unclear whether there was ever a right of navigation , or whether the Black <unk> Commissioners simply allowed it . The entrance lock was 72 by 20 feet ( 21 @.@ 9 by 6 @.@ 1 m ) , and most trade was between Boston and <unk> Bridge , with pleasure boating not being allowed prior to 1962 . The lock was closed and removed in 1971 , with little protest being made . More recently , the East Anglian Waterways Association promoted the idea that the <unk> could again be made navigable as part of a larger scheme to improve leisure facilities . The local authorities which were part of the <unk> Tourism consortium conducted a feasibility study , and this report was formally adopted as the <unk> Waterways Link by the Environment Agency in 2004 , with the support of the local authorities , the East Anglian Waterways Association and the Inland Waterways Association . 
 The scheme involved a total of 150 miles ( 240 km ) of waterway , of which 50 miles ( 80 km ) would be new <unk> , while the rest would be existing waterways which could be upgraded or have their access improved . When completed , it would connect the Rivers <unk> , Glen , <unk> , Nene and Great <unk> , and was heralded as the biggest waterway enhancement project in Europe by the Environment Agency . In 2007 they obtained funding for the link between Boston and <unk> . Work on a new lock beside the Black <unk> pumping station at Boston - to connect The Haven and the South Forty @-@ Foot <unk> - was formally started on 8 February 2008 , and was completed in December 2008 , with the official opening ceremony being held on 20 March 2009 . The lock project formed phase 1 of the scheme , and the cost of £ 8 @.@ 5 million was jointly funded by the European Regional Development Fund , the East Midlands Development Agency , and Lincolnshire County Council . The lock is designed to be used for a period either side of high tide , and so there is a rise from the <unk> to the Haven . It has conventional <unk> gates at one end , but uses rotating sector gates at the <unk> end , each one weighing 12 @.@ 1 tonnes . 
 The drain has been renamed as the Black <unk> Navigation by the Environment Agency . In order to use the navigation , an Environment Agency licence is required , and as there are no permanent <unk> available on the drain , these are available for one day or seven days . Water levels are maintained at a lower level during the winter months , when flows are high , and the <unk> needs to be able to cope with higher volumes of rainfall , than during the summer months , when navigable levels are maintained . As on the neighbouring River <unk> , the switch between winter and summer levels is normally made at the beginning of April . 
 By late 2011 , there were ten different routes under consideration , and an assessment of them was expected to be delivered in spring 2012 . <unk> Group , the engineering consultancy , were responsible for carrying out the assessment , which looked at the benefits that each route might provide , not only for navigation but also for water quality , water resources and habitat for wildlife . The study was expected to provide a short @-@ list of routes , which would then be the subject of further consultation . By mid @-@ 2012 , the merits of the ten routes had been considered , including the economic , environmental and technical issues involved , and a broad outline of the corridor for the link was scheduled to be published in September . After that , consultation with landowners and <unk> took place , to establish the final route , for which design of the channel and the associated locks , bridges , <unk> and pumping stations could then begin . By the end of the assessment process for the ten routes , two remained . One was route 1 , the original suggestion which used the existing course of the South Forty @-@ Foot <unk> for most of its length , while the second was a new route , designated as route 11 . Route 11 had become the preferred route by the summer of 2014 . It involves widening the South Forty @-@ Foot <unk> from <unk> to <unk> , to a point near to the Black Hole <unk> pumping station . A new lock would be needed at this location , but would connect to a new channel , rather than to the rest of the drain . It would pass under a new bridge on the <unk> , and the connection to the River Glen would involve another new lock . An environmental survey of other <unk> near to the route revealed that several provide habitat for nationally important plants and invertebrates . 
 The idea of a link between the South Forty @-@ Foot <unk> and the River Nene is not new , as the first plans for such a connection were proposed in 1809 . In that year , proposals for a new canal between the <unk> Canal at <unk> and the Stamford Canal at Stamford , which had been discussed in 1785 , were revived , as part of a larger plan for a 7 @-@ mile ( 11 km ) link from Stamford to the River Nene at Peterborough , and a connection from near Market <unk> , where the Stamford Canal rejoined the River <unk> , northwards to the South Forty @-@ Foot <unk> . A bill for this , together with one for a rival scheme to link Stamford to the Grand Junction Canal , which also included a connection to the South Forty @-@ Foot <unk> , were put before Parliament in 1811 , but neither met with any success . The idea was raised again in 1815 and 1828 , but no further action was taken . 
 The album debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200 , selling approximately 67 @,@ 000 copies in its first week in the United States , and ended up becoming the <unk> best selling album of 2011 in the US . It also charted in a few other countries , including Canada and the UK , a first for the band . The album also had five singles : " Hear Me Now " , " Been to Hell " , " Coming Back Down " , " <unk> ' in Hot " , and " My Town " , with music videos being made for all of them except " Coming Back Down " as it was released on the same day as " Been to Hell " . The band participated in three headlining tours : the <unk> Tour , the <unk> Summer Tour , and the World War III Tour , as well as other supporting tours throughout 2011 to promote the album . Upon release , American <unk> received mixed reviews . Critics consistently noted the darker and more serious tone of the album , but to mixed reception . Lyrics were widely criticized while the energy and instruments were praised in most reviews . 
 " <unk> Me " , the last soft song on the album , is a dark ballad that has been often compared to Eminem 's " Stan " . Johnny 3 Tears stated that , " We were <unk> around with chord <unk> and that came out like a more major chord style than we were used to it . It 's melodic and poppy sounding . We 're talking about drinking obviously because all of us sometimes drink too much . It 's one of those basic every day things that people go through but they don 't know how to voice it or others around them don 't know to voice it . It 's almost like you 're looked down upon , but no one actually talks about it . " " <unk> " , which is the closing track for the standard edition of the album , is a high tempo alternative metal song about murder . Johnny 3 Tears said , " When we wrote <unk> , I wanted to make a song that kids would just go nuts to when we played it . Kids start <unk> at our shows . Not every song we have is the best <unk> song , so I wanted to make a song kids could go crazy for . " 
 While the band was touring with <unk> <unk> , the guitarist <unk> Gates spoke about " <unk> " stating " Holy shit , that 's the <unk> verse I 've ever heard ! The lyrics are insane . " 
 Upon learning of the album 's first @-@ week sales , Jordan <unk> , also known to fans of the band as " Charlie Scene . " <unk> remarked , " I gotta be honest with everyone : I was really looking forward to the opportunity to be on top of Britney this week , but being right behind her and <unk> is a memory we ’ ll <unk> forever . " The album also debuted at number one on the US Hard Rock charts , number two on the US Rock , Digital , and Alternative charts , and number 11 on the <unk> Albums charts . Outside of the US , American <unk> charted number five in Canadian albums charts and number 43 in the UK albums charts . 
 At Metacritic , which assigns a <unk> rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics , the album received an average score of 59 , based on 6 reviews , which indicates " mixed or average reviews " . 
 All tracks are written and performed by Hollywood <unk> , with specific writers detailed for each track . 
 The <unk> class of light cruisers was a pair of two ships built for the German Imperial Navy before the start of World War I. The ships — SMS <unk> and <unk> — were very similar to the previous <unk> @-@ class cruisers , mounting the same armament and similar armor protection , though they were larger and faster than the earlier ships . Both vessels were laid down in 1911 , and launched one day apart , on 11 and 12 November 1912 . <unk> joined the fleet in January 1914 , but fitting out work lasted slightly longer on her sister ; <unk> was commissioned the following month . 
 Both of the ships had short service careers . <unk> was assigned to overseas duty in the Caribbean , arriving on station in July 1914 , days before the outbreak of World War I. Once the war began , she armed the passenger liner SS Kronprinz Wilhelm so it could raid British shipping . After a moderately successful commerce raiding career , during which <unk> sank sixteen merchant ships and successfully <unk> British cruisers , she sank after an accidental internal explosion on 4 November 1914 . Most of her crew were killed in the sinking , but the survivors returned to Germany on one of <unk> 's attendant <unk> by December . 
 <unk> served as a torpedo boat flotilla leader with the High Seas Fleet following her commissioning ; her flotilla frequently screened for the battlecruisers in the I Scouting Group , including during the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915 and operations off the British coast in early 1916 . She saw heavy action during the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916 as part of the screen for the main battle fleet . In the ferocious night fighting that occurred as the German fleet punched through the British rear @-@ guard , <unk> was torpedoed by a British destroyer , which <unk> the ship . She was taken under tow by several torpedo boats , but early on the morning of 1 June , the cruiser HMS Dublin located the cruiser . To prevent her capture by the British , the Germans scuttled the ship after taking off her crew . 
 The design for the <unk> class was prepared in 1910 , and was an incremental improvement over the previous <unk> class . <unk> and <unk> were faster and had a larger , more raked hull and greater displacement , but had the same armament and armor protection . <unk> was ordered as Ersatz <unk> and laid down in 1911 at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel , under construction number 181 . She was launched on 11 November 1912 and commissioned into the fleet on 15 January 1914 . <unk> was ordered as Ersatz <unk> and laid down in 1911 at the <unk> dockyard in Kiel , under construction number 560 . <unk> ceremonies took place on 12 November 1912 , a day after her sister . She was completed on 5 February 1914 , the date she joined the fleet . 
 <unk> and <unk> were armed <unk> to the previous <unk> @-@ class cruisers . They carried twelve 10 @.@ 5 cm SK L / 45 guns in single pedestal mounts . Two were placed side by side forward on the forecastle , eight were located amidships , four on either side , and two were side by side aft . The guns had a maximum elevation of 30 degrees , which allowed them to engage targets out to 12 @,@ 700 m ( 41 @,@ 700 ft ) . They were supplied with 1 @,@ 800 rounds of ammunition , for 150 shells per gun . The ships were also equipped with a pair of 50 cm ( 19 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes with five torpedoes submerged in the hull on the broadside . They could also carry 120 mines . 
 The ships ' armor was also identical to the preceding class . They were protected by a waterline armored belt that was 60 mm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) thick amidships ; the belt was reduced to 18 mm ( 0 @.@ 71 in ) forward . The stern was not armored . The conning tower had 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) thick sides and a 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) thick roof . The deck was covered with 60 mm thick armor plate forward , 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) amidships , and 20 mm aft . <unk> armor 40 mm thick connected the deck to the belt armor . 
 After her commissioning , <unk> was assigned to overseas duties in the Caribbean , where she was to relieve the cruiser Dresden . She arrived in the area in July 1914 , days before the outbreak of World War I. Once the war began , she armed the passenger liner SS Kronprinz Wilhelm so it could operate as a commerce <unk> , but while the ships were transferring equipment , British cruisers located them and pursued <unk> . Her superior speed allowed her to escape , after which she operated off the northeastern coast of Brazil . 
 <unk> <unk> at Puerto Rico , a possession of the then neutral United States before steaming to Brazil . Off the Brazilian coast , she captured or sank sixteen ships totaling 72 @,@ 805 gross register tons ( <unk> ) while <unk> her pursuers . The ship 's captain then decided to operate against the shipping lanes to Barbados . While en route on 4 November 1914 , a spontaneous internal explosion destroyed the ship and killed the majority of the crew , including her captain . The survivors used one of <unk> 's <unk> to return to Germany in December 1914 . 
 <unk> served with the High Seas Fleet as a leader of torpedo boat flotillas for the duration of her career . She served with the screens for both Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper 's battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group on operations against the British coast and the Battle of Dogger Bank . During the battle , British battlecruisers ambushed the German squadron and sank the armored cruiser <unk> . In April 1916 , she again screened the battlecruisers during the bombardment of Yarmouth and <unk> , during which <unk> and five other cruisers briefly engaged the British Harwich Force . 
 She was assigned to the screen for the battle fleet during the Battle of Jutland on 31 May – 1 June 1916 . She saw major action at Jutland and frequently engaged British light forces , including assisting in the destruction of the destroyers HMS <unk> and Nestor . <unk> 's participation in the battle culminated in her <unk> by destroyers shortly after midnight . She was taken under tow by German torpedo boats , but the following morning the cruiser HMS Dublin came upon the retreating ships . To prevent <unk> 's capture , the Germans set scuttling charges aboard her and took off the crew before firing torpedoes into the disabled cruiser to ensure she sank . 
 <unk> / <unk> / is a fictional character who appears in each of the seven seasons of the American science fiction television series Star Trek : Voyager . <unk> by Robert <unk> , he is First Officer aboard the Starfleet starship USS Voyager . The character was suggested at an early stage of the development of the series . He is the first Native American main character in the Star Trek franchise . This was an intended move by the producers of the series , who sought to provide an inspiration as with <unk> in Star Trek : The Original Series for African Americans . To develop the character , the producers sought the assistance of <unk> <unk> . Despite first being named as a Sioux , and later a <unk> , <unk> was given no tribal affiliation at the start of the series , something that was later resolved in the episode " <unk> " . 
 Reviewers of <unk> were critical of the stereotypical nature of <unk> 's Native American heritage . This led to comparisons with <unk> from The Lone Ranger , and that the inclusion of " Hollywood " versions of vision quests and meditation techniques were contrary to the character 's in @-@ universe tribal background . However , he was praised as a role model for Native American science fiction and called " ground @-@ breaking " , as well as the most prominent example of a Native American character within this genre . 
 The inclusion of a Native American character in Star Trek : Voyager was suggested at an early stage in the development of the series . The producers were looking for an ethnic background which had not been seen before as a main character in the franchise . It was hoped that a Native American character would prove to be an inspiration in the same way that the appearance of <unk> in Star Trek : The Original Series later inspired <unk> Goldberg and other African Americans . Executive producer <unk> Taylor said , " It seemed to us that Native Americans needed that same kind of role model and that same kind of boost ... the future looks good , you have purpose , you have worth , you have value , you will be leaders , you will be powerful . That was one character choice we had early on . " Taylor 's notes from the early production in July 1993 describe the character as " First Officer – a human native American male , a ' <unk> ' person who has <unk> Earth and lives as an expatriate on another planet . A mystical , mysterious man with whom the Captain has some prior connection , not explained . " A month later , this description was expanded with the line , " This man has made another choice – to re @-@ enter the world of Starfleet . " <unk> was not the first Native American character to appear in the franchise , with " The Paradise <unk> " in the third season of Star Trek : The Original Series showing a group of displaced humans following a Native @-@ American @-@ like culture . 
 The producers aimed to develop some conflict between the members of the crew to produce a scenario similar to the <unk> / Starfleet relationship seen in Star Trek : Deep Space Nine , but wanted the characters to share the same ideals . To do this , the <unk> were created – a group of Federation colonists from the <unk> border in a disputed territory who were joined by some Starfleet officers who joined them to fight for their rights . The producers had the <unk> introduced in other Star Trek series before Voyager in four episodes ; two in Star Trek : The Next Generation and two in Deep Space Nine . It was a deliberate reference to the political situation in the West Bank . 
 <unk> <unk> , the director of " <unk> " , was involved in casting the main cast for the series . He described the casting process for the part of <unk> as difficult due to the lower numbers of Native Americans who were in the Screen Actors Guild . The casting process came down to two actors , and the producers decided on Robert <unk> , who until then was best known for appearing in the soap opera Models Inc. and was of Mexican heritage . <unk> was not familiar with Star Trek before auditioning , and went along on the strength of the " <unk> " script which showed the character becoming the second in command of Voyager after both their vessels are stranded in the Delta <unk> . <unk> explained the audition experience , " I felt neutral about the audition , didn 't much care one way or the other . I went in the first time and wasn 't really trying to get the part . They asked to see me again , and they wanted to see more of an edge to the character . " 
 <unk> was originally written as a " calm , stoic " character , but <unk> expanded on the character during the audition process , something that <unk> credited him for . The writer 's <unk> described <unk> as a very traditional Native American with an altar and traditional art in his quarters . It also mentioned his spirit guide , something which was picked up in the media report in TV Guide . <unk> wore a facial tattoo whilst playing <unk> , which was applied with make @-@ up . This earned him comparisons to boxer Mike Tyson after the latter gained a facial tattoo . The design was created by Michael <unk> , who deliberately created it so it did not represent any particular tribal culture . The in @-@ universe story of the tattoo and <unk> 's tribal origins were explained in the episode " <unk> " . 
 <unk> said that he was not aware of the effects of the interactions this was having with the crew , and described the situation , saying , " for me it was like , ' OK , you can fire me if you want to . Go ahead , and I 'll leave . ' " He compared his experience on Voyager to working in a car factory , and said that the repetitive scenes meant that it limited his creativity . <unk> explained that it did not affect his relationship with the other actors , and in the end , he felt the producers decided to keep him on the cast as it did not make " very much difference , except to a very , very small percentage of fans who maybe didn 't like what I said . " 
 In an interview to <unk> the final episode of Voyager , " <unk> " , <unk> said , " We all had a great relationship with each other and we 've all said how much we enjoy our crew . We have a terrific crew . But at the same time , I 'm looking forward to what 's next . It 's exciting to know that something unknown is next . " The final episode introduced a romance between Seven of Nine and <unk> . Ryan found this confusing for the characters , as although it had been suggested in the episode " Human <unk> " , the producers told the pair to forget about the relationship in the in @-@ between episodes until the finale . 
 Some criticism was directed at <unk> 's character development during the series . James <unk> for the Star Tribune said that " <unk> , the rock @-@ solid First Officer , remained rock @-@ solid " , but also suggested that " [ a ] ll of the characters ended the series as they began . " 
 Critics commented on the relationship between <unk> and <unk> , with psychologist Richard <unk> 's views published in The Boston Herald . He suggesting that by several seasons into Voyager , <unk> had come to terms with his feelings for his Captain , but she was hesitant about entering into a relationship with a member of her crew . For the relationship to work in the future , it was said that <unk> should not try to lead the relationship and <unk> needed to be more vulnerable . Following the end of Star Trek : Enterprise , the romance between <unk> and <unk> was described in The Chicago Tribune as the one most wanted to be seen on screen in any of the Star Trek series , but that " it never panned out . <unk> ! " <unk> 's relationship with Seven was also commented on , and both UGO and io9 complained that the relationship appeared at random . 
 <unk> 's inclusion in the main cast of Voyager was seen by critics as one of several who was used to highlight the diversity within the series . This was highlighted during the episode " Faces " in which one scene showed <unk> , <unk> , Harry Kim , and <unk> in a single camera pan . <unk> 's individual position was that he was " continually positioned as an exotic native other in relation to the white female Captain <unk> " , and was used to " help the white protagonist and progress the internal narrative . " 
 Although religion was referenced during the Star Trek franchise , such as in the Star Trek : The Original Series episode " Who <unk> for <unk> ? " , it did not take a more prominent role until later in the series , with Star Trek : Deep Space Nine exploring the <unk> ' beliefs and Voyager concentrating on those of <unk> . These included vision quests , and other interpretation of Native American culture which were described by critics as showing a " very Hollywood version of Plains @-@ culture religion " . 
 The appearance of a medicine wheel in the episode " <unk> " was described by Sierra S. <unk> as showing <unk> in the " ' good Indian ' in the classic <unk> sense " . <unk> is seen attempting to introduce rituals and meditation techniques to other crew members , something they failed to understand . These were said to be contrary to the tribal history described in " <unk> " , which was said to say that <unk> 's tribe descended from a pre @-@ <unk> culture in Central America . <unk> attributed this to Euro @-@ American / European writers writing inaccurate information into scripts . However , the appearance of the character was described as " groundbreaking " . 
 Arthur A. Bell ( November 1882 – 22 April 1923 ) was an English footballer who played as an inside forward . He started his career with Burnley <unk> before joining Football League side Burnley in 1902 . Over the next seven years , Bell made 101 league appearances and scored 28 goals for the Lancashire club . During his career , he won three caps for the England national amateur football team . An architect by trade , Bell also played as an amateur <unk> for Burnley Cricket Club for 20 years , during which time he won five Lancashire League championships . He was selected to represent the Lancashire Second XI on three occasions . 
 Bell was born in Burnley , Lancashire , in November 1882 , one of three children born to Thomas and Elizabeth Bell . He was educated at the Burnley Grammar School . An amateur throughout his sporting career , he worked professionally as an architect and would often miss matches due to work commitments . In 1911 , he was involved in the building of the new <unk> Road stand at the <unk> Moor stadium in Burnley . He died on 22 April 1923 , at the age of 40 . 
 As a youth , Bell played amateur football with Burnley <unk> before joining Football League Second Division side Burnley in February 1902 . He made his debut for the club on 10 January 1903 in the 1 – 0 win against Lincoln City at <unk> Moor ; the winning goal was scored by <unk> <unk> , who was also playing in his first senior match after transferring from Burnley <unk> . Bell was selected once more in the 1902 – 03 campaign , playing at left inside forward in the 1 – 3 defeat to Leicester <unk> on 24 January 1903 . He was unable to break into the team for the first five months of the following season due to the form of fellow inside forward William Jackson , a new signing from Barrow . He made his first appearance of the campaign in the <unk> draw away at Grimsby Town on 30 January 1904 . Bell scored his first competitive goal for Burnley in the 2 – 0 win over Gainsborough Trinity three weeks later , and on 12 March he scored a late goal in the 1 – 3 loss away to Manchester United . In total , Bell played eleven league matches during the 1903 – 04 season and scored four goals . 
 Bell was selected to play in the opening match of the 1904 – 05 season , a 1 – 4 home defeat to West Bromwich Albion . Bell kept his place in the side for the following match against Chesterfield , but was dropped for the trip to Bolton Wanderers in favour of <unk> William Hutchinson , a summer signing from non @-@ League club <unk> . He was recalled for the visit of Liverpool on 22 October 1904 , <unk> for the unavailable Doug MacFarlane , but then spent more than two months out of the team . Bell made two further appearances for Burnley that season , playing in consecutive defeats to Bolton Wanderers and Blackpool in January 1905 . He found himself more involved in the first @-@ team during the 1905 – 06 campaign , making 19 league appearances . On 13 January 1906 , he played in the first FA Cup game of his career as Burnley were eliminated by Southern League side Tottenham Hotspur in the first round . Bell scored his first goal of the season on 10 February 1906 , netting the opening goal in the 2 – 2 draw against <unk> Port Vale . During March 1906 , he scored in the home wins over Leeds City and Chelsea . 
 After missing the first three matches of the 1906 – 07 season due to cricketing commitments , Bell was chosen to replace <unk> for the visit of Nottingham Forest on 15 September 1906 . Two weeks later he scored twice in the 4 – 0 home win over Burton United , and went on to score three more goals in his next four appearances , including a late winner away at Leeds City . However , the victory was overshadowed by the news that Leeds forward Soldier Wilson had died after collapsing during the match . Bell went on to score a total of 12 goals in 1906 – 07 , his highest return in a single season . His performances for Burnley led to a call @-@ up from the England amateur team in April 1907 , and he won his first cap in the 8 – 1 defeat of the Netherlands in The Hague . In the match , he played alongside full England internationals Harold <unk> and <unk> Woodward , who , like Bell , was a professional architect . 
 Although he again missed the opening month of the following season , Bell quickly reclaimed his status as one of Burnley 's first @-@ choice players , starting 26 league matches during the campaign . He scored on his first appearance of the season in the 2 – 2 draw away at Derby County , and scored twice in the 5 – 1 win against Grimsby Town on 2 November 1907 . Bell scored the only FA Cup goal of his career in the home tie against Southampton on 11 January 1908 , but could not prevent the Southern League side securing a 2 – 1 victory . He continued to play for Burnley when work and cricket allowed in the 1908 – 09 campaign , making 15 league appearances . He scored twice during the season ; he scored in the 1 – 4 defeat away at Oldham Athletic on 14 November , and scored the winning goal in the 3 – 2 defeat of Barnsley on 5 December . Bell played in 101st and final league game for Burnley in the 0 – 1 loss at Derby County on 26 December 1908 . He retired from football shortly afterwards , stating that playing football in winter in addition to cricket during the summer , combined with managing an architecture practice , was too demanding . 
 Aside from football , Bell was also an accomplished amateur <unk> ; he assisted Burnley Cricket Club between 1899 and 1919 , and would often choose to play cricket rather than football when the seasons overlapped . He was a member of the side that won the Lancashire League in 1901 and went on to captain the team that won three consecutive titles in 1906 , 1907 and 1908 . Bell won a fifth Lancashire League title with Burnley in the 1913 season . A left @-@ handed batsman , he also bowled slow left arm . Bell represented the Lancashire Second XI on three occasions in 1905 and 1906 . He was selected for two matches against the Surrey and Yorkshire second teams during the 1905 season and on 9 July 1906 he played in the Minor Counties Championship draw with <unk> at <unk> Moor , entering play as a substitute after Herbert Rhodes was injured while fielding . 
 As with other mammals , domestic sheep reproduction occurs sexually . Their reproductive strategy is very similar to other domestic herd animals . A flock of sheep is generally mated by a single ram , which has either been chosen by a farmer or has established dominance through physical contest with other rams ( in feral populations ) . Most sheep have a breeding season ( <unk> ) in the autumn , though some are able to breed year @-@ round . 
 Largely as a result of the influence of humans in sheep breeding , <unk> often produce multiple lambs . This increase in the lamb births , both in number and birth weight , may cause problems in delivery and lamb survival , requiring the intervention of shepherds . 
 Without human intervention , rams may fight during the <unk> to determine which individuals may mate with <unk> . <unk> , especially unfamiliar ones , will also fight outside the breeding period to establish dominance ; rams can kill one another if allowed to mix freely . During the <unk> , even normally friendly rams may become aggressive towards humans due to increases in their hormone levels . 
 Historically , especially aggressive rams were sometimes <unk> or <unk> . Today , those who keep rams typically prefer softer <unk> measures , such as moving within a clear line to an exit , never turning their back on a ram , and possibly <unk> with water or a diluted solution of <unk> or vinegar to dissuade charges . 
 Historically , vaginal insemination of sheep only produced 40 @-@ 60 % success rates , and was thus called a " shot in the dark " ( <unk> ) . In the 1980s , Australian researchers developed a <unk> insemination procedure which , combined with the use of <unk> and pregnant mare 's <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) , yielded much higher success rates ( 50 @-@ 80 % or more ) , and has become the standard for artificial insemination of sheep in the 21st century . 
 <unk> collection is naturally an integral component of this entire process . Once semen has been collected it can be used immediately for insemination or slowly frozen for use at a later date . Fresh semen is recognized as the method of choice as it lives longer and yields higher conception rates . Frozen semen will work but it must be the highest quality of semen and the <unk> must be <unk> twice in the same day . The marketing of ram semen is a major part of this industry . <unk> owning prize winning rams have found this to be a good <unk> to leverage the accolades of their most famous animals . 
 Average success rates in <unk> Transfer in terms of embryos recovered can vary widely . Each breed will respond differently to the <unk> process . Typically white faced <unk> and does are more fertile than black faced <unk> . A range of zero to the mid 20 ’ s in terms of viable embryos recovered from a <unk> procedure can be expected . Over the course of a year the average is 6 @.@ 8 <unk> eggs per donor with a 75 % conception rate for those eggs . 
 A big part of modern sheep reproduction is overall breeding animal health . In an effort to help improve animal health and ultimately performance many progressive <unk> rely on <unk> . Evidence based research <unk> by reliable field trials have shown improved performance in sheep . The name comes from the progenitor cells of the body . The progenitor cells are differentiated stem cells with specific direction and purpose to become the future building blocks of the body . The goal for <unk> is to support the body at the most fundamental levels encouraging efficient development of the progenitor cells . This approach is to impact the entire animal starting with immune function , gastrointestinal health , <unk> system , and importantly reproduction efficiency . 
 When birth is imminent , <unk> begin to take place , and the <unk> behavior of the <unk> may increase . A normal labor may take one to several hours , depending on how many lambs are present , the age of the <unk> , and her physical and nutritional condition prior to the birth . Though some breeds may regularly produce larger litters of lambs ( records stand around nine lambs at once ) , most produce either single or twin lambs . At some point , usually at the beginning of labor or soon after the births have occurred , <unk> and lambs may be confined to small <unk> <unk> . These pens , which are generally two to eight feet ( 0 @.@ 6 to 2 @.@ 4 m ) in length and width , are designed to aid both careful observation of <unk> and to cement the bond between them and their lambs . 
 In normal situations , lambs nurse after standing , receiving vital <unk> milk . <unk> that either fail to nurse or are prevented from doing so by the <unk> require aid in order to live . If <unk> the pair to accept nursing does not work , one of several steps may then be taken . <unk> may be held or tied to force them to accept a nursing lamb . If a lamb is not eating , a stomach tube may also be used to force feed the lamb in order to save its life . In the case of a permanently rejected lamb , a <unk> may then attempt to foster an orphaned lamb onto another <unk> . <unk> are also sometimes fostered after the death of their mother , either from the birth or other event . 
 <unk> plays a large factor in <unk> recognizing their lambs , so disrupting the scent of a newborn lamb with <unk> or over @-@ handling may cause a <unk> to reject it . Conversely , various methods of <unk> the scent of a <unk> 's own lamb to an orphaned one may be useful in <unk> . If an orphaned lamb cannot be fostered , then it usually becomes what is known as a bottle lamb — a lamb raised by people and fed via bottle . 
 After lambs are stabilized , lamb marking is carried out – this includes ear <unk> , <unk> , <unk> and usually <unk> . <unk> <unk> with numbers are the primary mode of identification when sheep are not named ; it is also the legal manner of animal identification in the European Union : the number may identify the individual sheep or only its flock . When performed at an early age , ear <unk> seems to cause little or no discomfort to lambs . However , using <unk> improperly or using <unk> not designed for sheep may cause discomfort , largely due to excess weight of <unk> for other animals . 
 For <unk> intent on strict improvements to their flocks , <unk> are classed and inferior sheep are removed prior to mating in order to maintain or improve the quality of the flock . <unk> ( <unk> ) faces have long been associated with lower fertility rates . <unk> or specially selected rams are chosen with aid of objective measurements , genetic information and evaluation services that are now available in Australia and New Zealand . The choice of mating time is governed by many factors including climate , market requirements and feed availability . <unk> are typically mated at about 2 @.@ 5 % depending on the age of the sheep , plus consideration as to the size and type of mating <unk> . The mating period ranges from about 6 to 8 weeks in commercial flocks . <unk> mating times result in management problems with lamb marking and <unk> etc . 
 <unk> are usually marked at three to six weeks of age , but a protracted <unk> season may <unk> two markings . 
 <unk> tends to occur in flocks of limited size and where only a single or a few rams are used . Associated with <unk> is a decline in <unk> performance usually referred to as <unk> depression . <unk> depression has been found for lamb <unk> , average daily weight gain from birth until two months , and litter size . 
 In the major sheep countries of Argentina , Uruguay , Brazil , Peru and Chile , <unk> are also utilizing <unk> testing and performance recording schemes as a means of improving their flocks . 
 In 2008 , for the first time in history , researchers at <unk> CSIRO research station , between <unk> and <unk> , New South Wales have used stem cells to develop surrogate rams and bulls . These males then produce the viable semen of another male . 
 The approach in these sheep experiments involves <unk> a ram ’ s <unk> while placing stem cells from a second ram into the <unk> of the first , ram A. In the following weeks ram A produces semen the usual way , but is using the stem cells of ram B and therefore producing semen carrying the genetics of ram B rather than those of his own . Ram A therefore has effectively become a surrogate ram . 
 The viable semen is then implanted in the <unk> and the many lambs born through this process are proving to be normal and healthy . DNA tests have proved that up to 10 % of the lambs are sired by the surrogate ram and carry the genetics of the donor ram . 
 " Mortal <unk> " and " Mortal <unk> " marked the first time that one Adventure Time episode carried the plot into another episode . The plot was concluded with " Mortal <unk> " which aired on the same day . The episode introduced the <unk> , who had first been proposed in the series ' pitch <unk> . Both episodes were supposed to air as the second season finale , but due to a studio mix @-@ up , they were aired as the penultimate episode , before " Heat Signature " . Despite this , they are still considered by Ward to function as the season two finale . Both episodes were watched by 1 @.@ 92 million people and received largely positive critical attention ; many critics enjoyed the way the episode began to set up the series ' mythology . 
 Finn and Jake , after acquiring the legendary gauntlet of Billy as well as a special pink <unk> made by <unk> , give chase , but they are consistently interrupted by the Ice King , who keeps trying to get Finn and Jake 's blessings to marry <unk> . <unk> up with their dismissive attitude , the Ice King kidnaps <unk> and follows Finn and Jake as the two heroes pursue the <unk> . The <unk> eventually reaches his lair , an abandoned subway station , and creates a pool of green liquid which he plans to use to regain his strength and destroy the world . 
 After Princess <unk> falls into the <unk> 's well of power , she is rushed to the Candy Kingdom hospital and saved . However , the Ice King feels that something is awry and tries to warn Finn , but Finn angrily <unk> him and tells him to leave the kingdom . Finn and Jake then focus their energy on taking care of Princess <unk> , whose behavior seems off . At first , she claims that she needs some rest , but soon she begins acting <unk> , such as <unk> in her bed . Finn leaves to acquire items that <unk> requests — which includes weapons @-@ grade plutonium , <unk> , and gasoline among other items — and Jake tries to <unk> <unk> up with a song . 
 While Finn <unk> her , the Ice King uses his ice powers to freeze <unk> . Their moment of success , however , is cut short when the still @-@ frozen <unk> tips over and <unk> everywhere . Her body parts are again rushed to the hospital where she is reassembled . However , there are not enough pieces to complete her , and so she ends up reverting to a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl . Finn , who is also 13 , is excited , but the Ice King temporarily gives up his pursuit of <unk> due to her age . As the episode ends , it is revealed that the <unk> has once again possessed the body of the <unk> , who angrily waves goodbye to the camera . 
 The end of " Mortal <unk> " introduced the plot thread of <unk> de @-@ aging to a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl . This would be expanded upon and eventually resolved in the third season episode " Too Young " . The younger version of <unk> was voiced by Isabella Acres , who would reprise her role in " Too Young " . According to <unk> , there were initially " rumors " to keep <unk> young for several episodes , but eventually her 13 @-@ year @-@ old version was relegated to only two appearances before she reverted to normal . 
 " Mortal <unk> " and " Mortal <unk> " first aired on <unk> Network on May 2 , 2011 . Both episodes were viewed by 1 @.@ 92 million viewers and scored a Nielsen rating of 1 @.@ 3 / 2 percent . This means it was seen by 1 @.@ 3 percent of all households and 2 percent of all households watching television at the time of the episode 's airing . The episodes first saw physical release as part of the 2012 Adventure Time : Jake vs. Me @-@ <unk> DVD , which included 16 episodes from the series ' first three seasons . It was later re @-@ released as part of the complete second season DVD in June 2013 . The season was originally supposed to end with " Mortal <unk> " / " Mortal <unk> " , but due to a scheduling conflict , " Heat Signature " was the last episode of the second season aired . Despite this , Ward still considers the two @-@ <unk> to be the real season finale , and the two entries are the last episodes featured on the second season DVD release . 
 Tyler Foster of DVD Talk praised both " Mortal <unk> " and " Mortal <unk> " , noting that , despite the fact that the episodes represented only " the beginning of the show 's journey into direct serialization " , the story @-@ arc was nonetheless " a <unk> taste of what 's to come . " Wired magazine noted it as one of the stand @-@ outs from the Jake vs. Me @-@ <unk> DVD , calling it a " three @-@ part suite " , which concluded with the third season episode " Too Young " . The review enjoyed the way the episode set the stage for the apparent death , resurrection , and de @-@ aging for Princess <unk> , which became a major plot point in the next season . Matt Fowler of IGN praised both " Mortal <unk> " and " Mortal <unk> " , specifically giving applause to the introduction of the <unk> , noting that he is " a real , grotesque villain inserted into the merely semi @-@ dark world of Adventure Time " . Fowler ended up being very happy with the two episodes , writing that they end the season " strong " . 
 <unk> and architecture are related , since , as with other arts , architects use mathematics for several reasons . Apart from the mathematics needed when engineering buildings , architects use geometry : to define the spatial form of a building ; from the <unk> of the sixth century BC onwards , to create forms considered <unk> , and thus to lay out buildings and their surroundings according to mathematical , aesthetic and sometimes religious principles ; to <unk> buildings with mathematical objects such as <unk> ; and to meet environmental goals , such as to minimise wind speeds around the bases of tall buildings . 
 In Ancient Egypt , Ancient Greece , India , and the Islamic world , buildings including pyramids , temples , mosques , palaces and <unk> were laid out with specific proportions for religious reasons . In Islamic architecture , <unk> shapes and <unk> <unk> patterns are used to <unk> buildings , both inside and outside . Some Hindu temples have a <unk> @-@ like structure where parts resemble the whole , conveying a message about the infinite in Hindu <unk> . In the twenty @-@ first century , mathematical ornamentation is again being used to cover public buildings . 
 The architects Michael <unk> and Kim Williams , considering the relationships between architecture and mathematics , note that the fields as commonly understood might seem to be only weakly connected , since architecture is a profession concerned with the practical matter of making buildings , while mathematics is the pure study of number and other abstract objects . But , they argue , the two are strongly connected , and have been since antiquity . In Ancient Rome , <unk> described an architect as a man who knew enough of a range of other disciplines , primarily geometry , to enable him to oversee skilled artisans in all the other necessary areas , such as masons and carpenters . The same applied in the Middle Ages , where graduates learnt arithmetic , geometry and aesthetics alongside the basic <unk> of grammar , logic , and rhetoric ( the <unk> ) in elegant halls made by master builders who had guided many craftsmen . A master builder at the top of his profession was given the title of architect or engineer . In the Renaissance , the <unk> of arithmetic , geometry , music and astronomy became an extra <unk> expected of the Renaissance man such as Leon <unk> <unk> . Similarly in England , Sir Christopher Wren , known today as an architect , was firstly a noted astronomer . 
 Architects use mathematics for several reasons , leaving aside the necessary use of mathematics in the engineering of buildings . Firstly , they use geometry because it defines the spatial form of a building . <unk> , they use mathematics to design forms that are considered beautiful or <unk> . From the time of the <unk> with their religious philosophy of number , architects in Ancient Greece , Ancient Rome , the Islamic world and the Italian Renaissance have chosen the proportions of the built environment – buildings and their designed surroundings – according to mathematical as well as aesthetic and sometimes religious principles . <unk> , they may use mathematical objects such as <unk> to <unk> buildings . <unk> , they may use mathematics in the form of computer modelling to meet environmental goals , such as to minimise <unk> air currents at the base of tall buildings . 
 The <unk> in Rome has survived intact , illustrating classical Roman structure , proportion , and decoration . The main structure is a dome , the apex left open as a circular <unk> to let in light ; it is fronted by a short <unk> with a triangular <unk> . The height to the <unk> and the diameter of the interior circle are the same , 43 @.@ 3 metres ( 142 ft ) , so the whole interior would fit exactly within a <unk> , and the interior could house a sphere of the same diameter . These dimensions make more sense when expressed in ancient Roman units of measurement : The dome spans 150 Roman feet ) ; the <unk> is 30 Roman feet in diameter ; the doorway is 40 Roman feet high . The <unk> remains the world 's largest <unk> concrete dome . 
 The next major text was <unk> <unk> 's <unk> <unk> d <unk> ( General Rules of Architecture ) ; the first volume appeared in Venice in <unk> ; the 1545 volume ( books 1 and 2 ) covered geometry and perspective . Two of <unk> 's methods for constructing perspectives were wrong , but this did not stop his work being widely used . 
 There are seven types of room that are the most beautiful and well <unk> and turn out better : they can be made circular , though these are rare ; or square ; or their length will equal the diagonal of the square of the breadth ; or a square and a third ; or a square and a half ; or a square and two @-@ thirds ; or two squares . 
 In 1615 , <unk> <unk> published the late Renaissance treatise L <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ( The <unk> of a Universal Architecture ) . He attempted to relate the design of cities and buildings to the ideas of <unk> and the <unk> , and to the more recent ideas of <unk> . 
 <unk> structures were used starting towards the end of the nineteenth century by Vladimir <unk> for masts , <unk> and cooling towers . Their striking shape is both <unk> interesting and strong , using structural materials economically . <unk> 's first <unk> tower was exhibited in <unk> <unk> in 1896 . 
 The early twentieth century movement Modern Architecture , pioneered by Russian <unk> , used rectilinear <unk> ( also called <unk> ) geometry . In the De <unk> movement , the horizontal and the vertical were seen as constituting the universal . The architectural form consists of putting these two directional tendencies together , using roof planes , wall planes and balconies , which either slide past or intersect each other , as in the 1924 <unk> <unk> House by <unk> <unk> . 
 <unk> architects were free to make use of curves as well as planes . Charles Holden 's 1933 <unk> station has a circular ticket hall in brick with a flat concrete roof . In 1938 , the <unk> painter <unk> <unk> @-@ <unk> adopted Raoul Heinrich <unk> 's seven <unk> elements , namely the crystal , the sphere , the <unk> , the plane , the ( <unk> ) strip , the ( cylindrical ) rod , and the spiral , as the supposed basic building blocks of architecture inspired by nature . 
 Le <unk> proposed an <unk> scale of proportions in architecture , the <unk> , based on the supposed height of a man . Le <unk> 's 1955 <unk> Notre Dame du <unk> uses free @-@ form curves not <unk> in mathematical formulae . The shapes are said to be evocative of natural forms such as the prow of a ship or praying hands . The design is only at the largest scale : there is no hierarchy of detail at smaller scales , and thus no <unk> dimension ; the same applies to other famous twentieth @-@ century buildings such as the Sydney Opera House , Denver International Airport , and the <unk> Museum , <unk> . 
 Contemporary architecture , in the opinion of the 90 leading architects who responded to a 2010 World Architecture Survey , is extremely diverse ; the best was judged to be Frank <unk> 's <unk> Museum , <unk> . 
 Denver International Airport 's terminal building , completed in 1995 , has a fabric roof supported as a minimal surface ( i.e. , its mean <unk> is zero ) by steel cables . It evokes Colorado 's snow @-@ capped mountains and the <unk> tents of Native Americans . 
 The architect Richard <unk> Fuller is famous for designing strong thin @-@ shell structures known as <unk> <unk> . The <unk> <unk> dome is 61 metres ( 200 ft ) high ; its diameter is 76 metres ( 249 ft ) . 
 Sydney Opera House has a dramatic roof consisting of soaring white vaults , reminiscent of ship 's sails ; to make them possible to construct using standardized components , the vaults are all composed of triangular sections of spherical shells with the same radius . These have the required uniform <unk> in every direction . 
 The pyramids of Ancient Egypt are tombs constructed with deliberately chosen proportions , but which these were has been debated . The face angle is about 51 ° 85 ’ , and the ratio of the <unk> height to half the base length is 1 @.@ <unk> , less than 1 % from the golden ratio . If this was the design method , it would imply the use of Kepler 's triangle ( face angle 51 ° 49 ’ ) . However it is more likely that the pyramids ' slope was chosen from the 3 @-@ 4 @-@ 5 triangle ( face angle 53 ° 8 ’ ) , known from the <unk> <unk> <unk> ( c . 1650 – 1550 BC ) ; or from the triangle with base to <unk> ratio 1 : 4 / <unk> ( face angle 51 ° 50 ’ ) . 
 <unk> <unk> , the ancient Indian canons of architecture and town planning , employs symmetrical drawings called <unk> . Complex calculations are used to arrive at the dimensions of a building and its components . The designs are intended to integrate architecture with nature , the relative functions of various parts of the structure , and ancient beliefs utilizing <unk> patterns ( <unk> ) , symmetry and directional <unk> . However , early builders may have come upon mathematical proportions by accident . The mathematician Georges <unk> notes that simple " tricks " with string and stakes can be used to lay out <unk> shapes , such as <unk> and right angles . 
 The mathematics of <unk> has been used to show that the reason why existing buildings have universal appeal and are visually satisfying is because they provide the viewer with a sense of scale at different viewing distances . For example , in Hindu temples such as the <unk> Temple at Hampi built in the seventh century , and others such as the <unk> <unk> Temple at <unk> , the parts and the whole have the same character , with <unk> dimension in the range 1 @.@ 7 to 1 @.@ 8 . The cluster of smaller towers ( <unk> , lit . ' mountain ' ) about the tallest , central , tower which represents the holy Mount Kailash , abode of Lord Shiva , depicts the endless repetition of <unk> in Hindu <unk> . The religious studies scholar William J. Jackson observed of the pattern of towers grouped among smaller towers , themselves grouped among still smaller towers , that : 
 The ideal form <unk> <unk> suggests the infinite rising levels of existence and consciousness , expanding sizes rising toward <unk> above , and at the same time housing the sacred deep within . 
 The <unk> <unk> Temple is a large complex with multiple shrines , with the streets of <unk> laid out <unk> around it according to the <unk> . The four <unk> are tall towers ( <unk> ) with <unk> @-@ like repetitive structure as at Hampi . The enclosures around each shrine are rectangular and surrounded by high stone walls . 
 <unk> ( c . <unk> – c . <unk> <unk> ) and his followers , the <unk> , held that " all things are numbers " . They observed the harmonies produced by notes with specific small @-@ <unk> ratios of frequency , and argued that buildings too should be designed with such ratios . The Greek word <unk> originally denoted the harmony of architectural shapes in precise ratios from a building 's smallest details right up to its entire design . 
 The golden ratio was known in 300 <unk> , when Euclid described the method of <unk> construction . It has been argued that the golden ratio was used in the design of the <unk> and other ancient Greek buildings , as well as sculptures , paintings , and <unk> . More recent authors such as <unk> <unk> , however , doubt all these claims . Experiments by the computer scientist George <unk> failed to find any preference for the golden <unk> . 
 Mughal architecture , as seen in the abandoned imperial city of <unk> <unk> and the Taj <unk> complex , has a distinctive mathematical order and a strong aesthetic based on symmetry and harmony . 
 The 1971 Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Assumption , San Francisco has a saddle roof composed of eight segments of <unk> <unk> , arranged so that the bottom horizontal cross section of the roof is a square and the top cross section is a Christian cross . The building is a square 77 @.@ 7 metres ( 255 ft ) on a side , and 57 @.@ 9 metres ( 190 ft ) high . The 1970 Cathedral of Brasília by Oscar <unk> makes a different use of a <unk> structure ; it is constructed from 16 identical concrete beams , each weighing 90 tonnes , arranged in a circle to form a <unk> of revolution , the white beams creating a shape like hands praying to heaven . Only the dome is visible from outside : most of the building is below ground . 
 The architecture of fortifications evolved from medieval <unk> , which had high masonry walls , to low , symmetrical star forts able to resist artillery bombardment between the mid @-@ fifteenth and nineteenth centuries . The geometry of the star shapes was dictated by the need to avoid dead zones where attacking infantry could shelter from defensive fire ; the sides of the projecting points were angled to permit such fire to sweep the ground , and to provide crossfire ( from both sides ) beyond each projecting point . Well @-@ known architects who designed such defences include <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> Le <unk> de <unk> . 
 The architectural historian Siegfried <unk> argued that the star @-@ shaped fortification had a formative influence on the <unk> of the Renaissance ideal city : " The Renaissance was <unk> by one city type which for a century and a half — from <unk> to <unk> — was impressed upon all <unk> schemes : this is the star @-@ shaped city . " 
 Architects may also select the form of a building to meet environmental goals . For example , Foster and Partners ' 30 St Mary Axe , London , known as " The <unk> " for its <unk> @-@ like shape , is a solid of revolution designed using <unk> modelling . Its geometry was chosen not purely for aesthetic reasons , but to minimise <unk> air currents at its base . Despite the building 's apparently curved surface , all the panels of glass forming its skin are flat , except for the lens at the top . Most of the panels are <unk> , as they can be cut from rectangular glass with less <unk> than triangular panels . 
 The traditional <unk> ( ice pit ) of Persia functioned as an <unk> cooler . Above ground , the structure had a domed shape , but had a subterranean storage space for ice and sometimes food as well . The subterranean space and the thick heat @-@ resistant construction <unk> the storage space year round . The internal space was often further cooled with <unk> . The ice was available in the summer to make the frozen <unk> <unk> . 
 Thomas George " Tom " Hooper ( born 5 October 1972 ) is a British film and television director of English and Australian background . Hooper began making short films as a teenager , and had his first professional short , <unk> Faces , broadcast on Channel 4 in 1992 . At Oxford University Hooper directed plays and television commercials . After graduating , he directed episodes of <unk> , <unk> Grove , <unk> and Cold Feet . 
 Hooper 's work was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for Prime <unk> and John Adams , won one for Elizabeth I , and was nominated for the British Academy ( BAFTA ) TV Craft Award for Best Director for Longford . The King 's Speech won multiple awards , including Best Director wins for Hooper from the Directors Guild of America and the Academy Awards , and a Best Director nomination from BAFTA . 
 Tom Hooper was born in 1972 in London , England , the son of Meredith Jean ( <unk> ) and Richard Hooper . Meredith was an Australian author and academic and Richard was an English media businessman . Hooper was educated at <unk> School and Westminster School . His initial interest in drama was triggered by his English and drama teacher at <unk> , former Royal Shakespeare Company actor Roger Mortimer , who produced an annual school play . 
 At the age of 12 , Hooper read a book entitled How to Make Film and Television and decided he wanted to become a director . For the next year Hooper researched filmmaking from publications such as On Camera by Harris Watts . <unk> 13 , he made his first film , entitled Runaway Dog , using a clockwork <unk> <unk> camera his uncle had given to him . Hooper said : " The clockwork would run out after thirty seconds , so the maximum shot length was thirty seconds . I could only afford a hundred feet of <unk> reversal film , which cost about twenty @-@ five [ pounds ] , and you had to send off for two weeks to be processed . I could only make silent movies , because sound was too expensive and complicated . " He slowed down the frame rate of the camera so he could <unk> what little film stock he had . Hooper classified the short , about a dog which kept running away from its owner , as a comedy , and filmed it on location in <unk> . 
 When Hooper was 14 , his film <unk> <unk> came runner @-@ up in a BBC younger filmmakers ' competition . The short starred Hooper 's brother as a boy who discovers a bomber jacket and a photograph hidden in a cupboard and learns his grandfather died in World War II . Another of Hooper 's short films , entitled <unk> , depicts a nuclear <unk> . 
 Hooper finished school aged 16 , then wrote the script for his first professional short film , entitled <unk> Faces . He spent the next two years raising capital for the short by courting advertisement directors , whose financial dominance during the late 1980s was noticed by Hooper . Director Paul Weiland invested in the short , which provided Hooper with the equipment he needed . After two years of financing and production , <unk> Faces was completed . Hooper wrote , produced , directed and edited it . It was sold to Channel 4 and broadcast on the channel 's First Frame <unk> in 1992 , had a screening at the 35th London Film Festival and had a limited theatrical release . 
 After taking a gap year to finance <unk> Faces , Hooper read English at University College , Oxford . He joined the Oxford University Dramatic Society , where he directed Kate <unk> in A View From the Bridge and Emily Mortimer in The Trial . Hooper also had his first paid directing work , earning £ 200 for a corporate Christmas video , and he directed his first television advertisements , including one for Sega featuring Right Said Fred . He continues to direct advertisements alongside television and film projects . In 1996 he joined the commercial production company John S. Clarke Productions and in 2001 he signed with Infinity Productions . 
 After graduating from Oxford , Hooper directed further television commercials , intending to break into the film industry the same way Ridley Scott , Tony Scott and Hugh Hudson did . He was introduced by his father to the television producer Matthew Robinson , who <unk> Hooper and gave him his first television directing work . For Robinson , Hooper directed episodes of the short @-@ lived <unk> <unk> Television soap opera <unk> in 1997 , four episodes of the Children 's BBC television series <unk> Grove in the same year , and his first episodes of the BBC One soap opera <unk> in 1998 . 
 In 1999 , Hooper directed two episodes of Granada Television 's comedy @-@ drama television series Cold Feet , which marked his move to bigger @-@ budget productions . There was initially concern at Granada that Hooper might be an unsuitable director for the series given his background in drama . 
 In 2000 , Hooper directed his first of two costume dramas for the BBC ; Love in a Cold Climate was based on Nancy Mitford 's novels The <unk> of Love and Love in a Cold Climate . Hooper , the writer Deborah <unk> , and the producer Kate <unk> researched the period details of the production by interviewing Nancy 's sister Deborah . In 2002 , Hooper directed Daniel <unk> , adapted from George Eliot 's novel . Filming ran for 11 weeks from May to August on locations in England , Scotland and Malta . Hooper said of the production , " The thing I like about this tale is that it 's not at all your conventional costume drama ; it 's far more complex and looks at aspects of love , loss and religion . " The Guardian 's Mark Lawson said of Hooper 's two costume dramas , " he brought <unk> and intelligence to television 's most conservative form " . 
 Hooper made his debut as a feature film director with the South African Truth and <unk> Commission drama Red <unk> ( 2004 ) , which stars <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> and Jamie Bartlett . The film was not widely seen , which Hooper attributed to media coverage of torture during the Iraq War : " When I started making it you could watch the movie with a wonderful sense of ' we 'd never do it in our own country … they 're the horrible people but it 's not us . ' By the time the film came out ( there were ) these revelations that the Americans were <unk> , the British were <unk> . The film became a lot more uncomfortable for the very audiences it was designed to target . I have learned that sadly the theatrical audience does not run to see films that are openly issue led . " The premiere of the film in the United Kingdom came on BBC Two in 2005 , making it eligible for the BAFTA Television Awards ; it was nominated in the Best Single Drama category at the 2006 ceremony . 
 Elizabeth I and Longford led directly to Hooper being selected by Tom Hanks to direct the epic miniseries John Adams for <unk> and HBO . Hooper had been working on a biographical film with Joan <unk> about <unk> Graham , publisher of The Washington Post , since 2006 when he was asked by Hanks to helm the programme . The miniseries , starring Paul <unk> as John Adams , was based on David <unk> 's Adams biography and was Hooper 's first wholly American production . He was surprised to learn that the American Revolutionary War was not a well @-@ documented period in film and television ; <unk> Adams actress Laura <unk> told him that , for her generation , the musical 1776 was the most well @-@ known depiction of the era . He worked on the miniseries for a total of 16 months ; principal photography lasted 110 days on locations in the United States , France , England and Hungary and he controlled a $ 100 million budget . The Boston Globe 's Matthew Gilbert complimented Hooper 's style of direction in the first two episodes " <unk> or Die " and " Independence " : 
 Director Tom Hooper lets his actors shine , as he did so <unk> in Helen <unk> 's Elizabeth I and the child @-@ killer drama Longford , but he <unk> them , too , with this kind of immediate point of view . And when he does give us panoramic shots from <unk> – of the Adams farm in <unk> , for example – they 're <unk> , to keep us out of the classroom mode . At the end of episode 2 [ ... ] Hooper showcases all his directorial strength with one bold choice . When the long @-@ <unk> Congress finally decides to break with Britain , he <unk> from using any visual or <unk> tweaks . Upon the announcement , " The resolution carries , " the scene remains perfectly silent for one long moment . The terror of responsibility hangs heavily in the room , while a victorious soundtrack surely would have chased it away . 
 John Adams received 23 Emmy Award nominations , including another Outstanding Direction nomination for Hooper , and won 13 , the highest number for any nominee in a single year . He was also nominated for the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding <unk> Achievement . At the beginning of 2009 , he was <unk> for The Observer 's film <unk> . 
 Work on Hooper 's next film , The King 's Speech , began in the same year . Hooper explained : " It was a stage play , and my mother who 's Australian was invited to a fringe [ theatre ] reading in London because she 's part of the Australian community . The play 's about the relationship between King George the Sixth and his Australian speech therapist . She came back and said ' you 've got to read this play , ' and I read it and it was brilliant ... " . Hooper cast Colin Firth as George VI and Geoffrey Rush as Lionel <unk> and spent three weeks with the actors reading the script and rehearsing . Principal photography took place on location around the UK from November 2009 to January 2010 . During editing , Hooper continued to consult with Firth and Rush by sending them cuts of the film and listening to their feedback . 
 Hooper completed the final cut of the film at the end of August 2010 and presented it a few days later at the <unk> Film Festival . The film won the People 's Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival and Hooper won the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding <unk> Achievement in Motion Pictures . In February 2011 , he was presented with the Academy Award for Best Director , though lost the BAFTA Award for Best Direction to David Fincher . In comparing the two films , Variety 's Adam <unk> wrote , " Hooper 's 2009 film The <unk> United didn 't register among awards <unk> , but King 's Speech is a much more personal project . His Anglo @-@ Australian parentage reflects the culture clash at the heart of the movie , and it pays off with beautifully crafted , crowd @-@ pleasing drama . " 
 Following the success of The King 's Speech during the awards season , Hooper joined the 15 @-@ person board of governors at the British Film Institute , was invited to join the directors branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences , and was ranked at number 19 in The Times ' British Film Power 100 . In March 2009 , Hooper met with Nelson <unk> in preparation for directing a film adaptation of <unk> 's autobiography Long Walk to Freedom . By 2012 , however , he had left the project . 
 He was offered the chance to direct Iron Man 3 for Marvel Studios but declined and instead signed on to direct Les <unk> for Working Title Films , which he had first heard about while discussing a different project with screenwriter William Nicholson in 2010 . Hooper had not seen the musical , so watched a performance of it in London 's West End . Adapted from the musical , the film starred Hugh Jackman , Russell Crowe , Anne <unk> , Amanda <unk> , Helena <unk> Carter , <unk> Baron Cohen , and Eddie <unk> . As the film required the actors to sing and dance , they were auditioned in front of Hooper , producers and composers . The role of <unk> was hugely contested ; Hooper said , " It was like half a dozen of the biggest female movie stars on the planet wanted to play the role " . 
 Filming started in February 2012 . Hooper investigated filming the feature in 3D , and performed some camera tests before deciding to film it with traditional 2D methods . He stated " [ ... ] I slightly worry with 3D that some people will physically struggle with it . If you have a certain type of eyesight it can be more demanding than watching a normal movie . " Unlike other musical films , Les <unk> features the actors singing live on camera , rather than <unk> to backing vocals . Hooper told Los Angeles Times that he thought there was a " slightly strange <unk> " when he saw musical films where the actors sang to recordings . The actors wore wireless <unk> on set so they could sing to accompanying piano music . Hooper believed this method allowed the actors to have emotional control over their songs : " When Annie [ <unk> , who plays <unk> ] is singing ' I <unk> a Dream ' , if she needs to take a tenth of a second to have a thought before she sings it , or to have an emotion before she sings a line , she can take it . " The actors also performed their songs in <unk> style , which Hooper likened to being immersed in a 3D film . Les <unk> was released in North America on 25 December 2012 , and received eight Academy Award nominations including Best Picture . 
 Hooper 's fifth feature film , The Danish Girl , was released in late 2015 . It loosely tells the story of <unk> <unk> , one of the first people to undergo sex <unk> surgery , and wife <unk> <unk> . It stars Eddie <unk> and Alicia <unk> , both of whom received Academy Award nominations . Critics were generally positive about the film . 
 Hooper uses camera styles " that encode the DNA of the storytelling in some way " and will reuse and develop filming styles in successive productions . Hooper identifies research as being key to his process of directing period dramas such as John Adams in order to make the scenes authentic . For The <unk> United , Hooper and director of photography Ben <unk> researched the look of the late 1960s and early 1970s through football photography books . Hooper has also been influenced by cinematographer Larry Smith , who worked with Stanley Kubrick and advised Hooper of techniques used by Kubrick . Hooper and Smith have worked together on Cold Feet , Love in a Cold Climate , Prime <unk> , Red <unk> and Elizabeth I. 
 Hooper also uses uncommon framing techniques to emphasise story ; in John Adams , he wanted to imply American independence seemed unlikely during the Revolutionary War , so he used " a very rough camera style — almost all hand held , wide lenses close to the actors , lots of movement , many cameras shooting at once so there was often not a settled master " point of view " , and lots of <unk> <unk> <unk> so the horizon lines of the frame were often being thrown off . " The America @-@ set scenes were contrasted by the scenes set in France , in which more traditional filming techniques were employed to evoke a feel of entrenched values . Similarly , in The <unk> United , Hooper began to experiment with using wide @-@ angle lenses and putting actors in the extreme edges of the frame . He was influenced by the unusual framing from social photography of the 1970s , and he and Ben <unk> decided to adopt the framing style while <unk> locations . Hooper used the same style in The King 's Speech , particularly in the scene where <unk> and <unk> meet in <unk> 's consulting room ; Colin Firth is framed to the extreme left of the picture , leaving most of the shot dominated by the rough wall behind Firth . 
 In 1842 , Ernest married Princess <unk> of Baden in what was to be a <unk> marriage . Soon after , he succeeded as duke upon the death of his father on 29 January 1844 . As reigning Duke Ernest II , he supported the German Confederation in the <unk> @-@ <unk> Wars against Denmark , sending thousands of troops and becoming the commander of a German corps ; as such , he was instrumental in the 1849 victory at the battle of <unk> against Danish forces . After King Otto of Greece was deposed in 1862 , the British government put Ernest 's name forward as a possible successor . Negotiations fell through however for various reasons , not in the least of which was that he would not give up his beloved <unk> in favor of the Greek throne . 
 A supporter of a unified Germany , Ernest watched the various political movements with great interest . While he initially was a great and outspoken proponent of the liberal movement , he surprised many by switching sides and supporting the more conservative ( and eventually victorious ) <unk> during the Austro @-@ Prussian and Franco @-@ Prussian wars and subsequent unification of Germany . His support of the <unk> came at a price however , and he was no longer viewed as the possible leader of a political movement . According to historian Charlotte <unk> , Ernest became " increasingly lost in a <unk> of private <unk> which earned only contempt from outside " . 
 Ernest 's position was often linked to his brother Prince Albert , husband of Queen Victoria . The two boys were raised as though twins , and became closer upon the separation and divorce of their parents , as well as the eventual death of their mother . The princes ' relationship experienced phases of closeness as well as minor arguments as they grew older ; after Albert 's death in 1861 , Ernest became gradually more antagonistic to Victoria and her children , as well as increasingly bitter toward the United Kingdom , publishing anonymous pamphlets against various members of the British royal family . Despite their increasingly differing political views and opinions however , Ernest accepted his second eldest nephew Prince Alfred , Duke of Edinburgh as his heir @-@ <unk> , who upon Ernest 's death on 22 August 1893 at <unk> , succeeded to the <unk> throne . 
 There are various accounts of Ernest 's childhood . When he was fourteen months old , a servant commented that Ernest " runs around like a <unk> . He is <unk> and as cross as a little <unk> from <unk> and <unk> . He is not pretty now , except his beautiful black eyes " . In May 1820 , his mother described Ernest as " very big for his age , as well as intelligent . His big black eyes are full of spirit and <unk> " . Biographer Richard Hough writes that " even from their infancy , it was plainly evident that the elder son took after his father , in character and appearance , while Albert strongly resembled his mother in most respects " . Ernest and his brother often lived with their grandmother the <unk> Duchess of <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> until her death in 1831 . 
 In 1836 , Ernest and Albert visited their <unk> eligible cousin Princess Victoria of Kent , spending a few weeks at Windsor . Both boys , and especially Albert were considered by his family to be a potential husband for the young princess , and they were both taught to speak competent English . Their father first thought that Ernest would make a better husband to Victoria than Albert , possibly because his sporting interests would be better received by the British public . Most others favored Albert over Ernest as a possible husband however . <unk> , Victoria was much more like Ernest , as both were lively and <unk> with a love for dancing , gossip , and late nights ; <unk> , this fast pace made Albert physically ill . Victoria believed Ernest had a " most kind , honest , and intelligent expression in his countenance " , while Albert " seemed full of <unk> and <unk> , and very clever and intelligent " . No offer of marriage was forthcoming for either brother however , and they returned home . 
 Ernest entered military training later that year . In April 1837 , Ernest and Albert and their household moved to the University of <unk> . Six weeks into their academic term , Victoria succeeded as Queen of the United Kingdom . As rumors of an impending marriage between her and Albert <unk> with their studies , the two brothers left on 28 August 1837 at the close of the term to travel around Europe . They returned to <unk> in early November to continue their studies . In 1839 , the brothers traveled to England again , where Victoria found her cousin Albert <unk> and soon proposed . This connection would have many implications upon Ernest in the future ; for instance , he was selected as <unk> for Albert 's second daughter Princess Alice , and would eventually come to give her away at her wedding , only months after Albert 's death . 
 Various candidates were put forward as a possible wife for Ernest . His own father wanted him to look high @-@ up for a wife , such as a Russian grand <unk> . One possibility was Princess <unk> of <unk> , a daughter of Louis Philippe I , whom he met while visiting the court at the <unk> . Such a marriage would have required his conversion from <unk> to Roman Catholicism however , and consequently nothing came of it . She later married his cousin Prince August of <unk> @-@ <unk> and <unk> . Ernest was also considered by <unk> Queen Maria Christina as a possible husband for her young daughter Isabella II of Spain , and by Queen Victoria for her cousin Princess Augusta of Cambridge . 
 In <unk> on 3 May 1842 , Ernest married 21 @-@ year @-@ old Princess <unk> of Baden . She was the eldest daughter of Leopold , Grand Duke of Baden and Princess Sophie of Sweden , daughter of the deposed King Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden . Though he gave his consent , his father was disappointed that his second son did not do more to advance the concerns of <unk> . The marriage did not produce any issue , though Ernest apparently <unk> at least three illegitimate children in later years . 
 Ernest had suffered from a <unk> disease in his late teens and early twenties , most likely as the consequence of living a wild , <unk> lifestyle . These qualities he had inherited under the tutelage of his father , who took his sons to " sample the pleasures " of Paris and Berlin , to Albert 's " horror and shame " . Ernest had been so visibly deteriorating in appearance as a result that Sarah <unk> , a lady @-@ in @-@ waiting of Queen Victoria , observed at Windsor in 1839 that he was " very thin and hollow @-@ <unk> and pale , and no likeness to his brother , nor much beauty . But he has fine dark eyes and black hair , and light figure , and a great look of spirit and <unk> " . Later that year , Albert <unk> his brother against finding a wife until his ' condition ' was fully recovered . He further warned that continued promiscuity could leave Ernest incapable of <unk> children . Some historians believe that while he himself was able to father other children , the disease rendered his young wife infertile . 
 As the years went by with further <unk> , Ernest became more distant to his wife , and was continually <unk> . Though <unk> continued to be devoted , choosing to ignore those relationships she was aware of , her loyalty became increasingly <unk> to those outside her immediate family . By 1859 , after seventeen years of <unk> , Ernest took no further interest in his wife . 
 On 29 January 1844 , Ernest 's father died in <unk> , one of the territories their family had recently acquired . Ernest consequently succeeded to the <unk> of <unk> @-@ <unk> and <unk> as Ernest II . 
 <unk> to a great degree , Ernest had many money troubles throughout his reign . In January 1848 , Ernest visited his brother in the midst of political unrest in Germany . Upon his return , he also discovered unrest in <unk> . One of the many concerns related to finances . Although Ernest had a large inheritance , he also had frequent debts . There were increasing calls to <unk> most of his property . Indeed , Albert had to intervene at one point and spare his brother the embarrassment of losing one of his <unk> properties . 
 During the 1848 turmoil in Germany , Albert had been constructing his own liberal reform plan , under which a single monarch , chancellor , and parliament would unite the German states ; in addition , each state would retain its own current ruling dynasty . As this plan <unk> to his brother , Ernest was given a copy in the hope that he would develop his own liberal constitution . Ernest subsequently made a few concessions , but his position remained sound , not counting the increasing problem of his debts . A constitution was drafted and promulgated in 1849 in <unk> , though one had existed in <unk> since 1821 . In 1852 , both <unk> were <unk> into one , which converted the personal union of the two <unk> into a real union ; the <unk> were now <unk> , with a common set of institutions . During the political turmoil , timely concessions and Ernest 's popular habit of <unk> with " the people in their pleasures " were instrumental in keeping him from losing his throne . Furthermore , various contemporary sources state that Ernest was an able , just and very popular ruler , which may have also helped keep him in power . 
 From 1848 to 1864 , Denmark and the German Confederation fought over control of the two <unk> of <unk> and <unk> . Historically , the <unk> had been ruled by Denmark since medieval times , but there remained a large German majority . This majority was sparked to rebellion after Frederick VII of Denmark announced on 27 March 1848 the <unk> would become an integral part of Denmark under his new liberal constitution . Prussia soon became involved , supporting the uprising and beginning the First <unk> War . Ernest sent 8 @,@ 000 men initially , adding to the army sent by the German Confederation . He also desired to be given a military job during the war , but was refused , as it was " extremely difficult to offer me a position in the army of <unk> @-@ <unk> corresponding to my rank " , according to his memoirs . He agreed to a smaller command , coming to lead a <unk> contingent ; he commented in a letter to his brother that " I should have declined any other command of the kind , but I could not refuse this one , as , in the present condition of our States , it is important to keep the executive power in our hands " . As commander of a German corps , Ernest was instrumental in winning the 5 April 1849 battle of <unk> against Danish forces . 
 The first war ended in 1851 , but would resume in 1864 . During this interlude , Ernest <unk> opposed the marriage of his nephew Albert Edward , Prince of Wales ( ' <unk> ' ) to Princess Alexandra of Denmark , a daughter of the future Christian IX of Denmark ( and therefore an enemy of the German states ) . He believed that such a match flew in the face of German interests . Albert replied angrily " What has that got to do with you ? ... <unk> has <unk> her <unk> to help us to find someone , but in vain ... We have no [ other reasonable ] choice " . Albert agreed there were going to be problems with the match , but as he could find no alternative bride , he wrote to Ernest that keeping the affair a private matter ( and outside the realm of government ) was " the only way to prevent a break with Prussia and the only way to keep the game in our own hands , impose the conditions that we think necessary , and as far as we can , take off its political edge " . Albert also warned his son of Ernest 's <unk> to interfere with the match , commenting , " Your uncle ... will try his hand at this work . Your best defence will be not to enter on the subject , should he <unk> it " . 
 The Duke had a reputation for being a strong friend of the United States , as did his brother Albert . He was , however , the only European sovereign to appoint a consul , Ernst Raven , to the Confederate States of America , on 30 July 1861 . The Texas government , where Raven resided , made it clear , however , that his request for an <unk> did not imply or extend diplomatic recognition to the Confederate regime . 
 There were problems to the nomination ; Ernest had no children , and thus would have had to adopt one of the princes of his house to succeed him as King of Greece . To solve this problem , Ernest suggested to <unk> that he simply take the title regent of Greece and hold the kingdom in trust for his chosen heir . He also stipulated that if he accepted the throne , it should be subject to certain guarantees by the other powers . The apparent deal @-@ breaker however was the fact that Ernest wanted to acquire the Greek throne and still maintain control of his " safer " <unk> . In the end , the British cabinet thought the proposed conditions unacceptable . His proposals turned down , Ernest in turn refused . In 1863 , the Greek throne was accepted by another member of a royal family : the Princess of Wales ' younger brother Prince William of Denmark . Ernest would later comment , " That this cup was spared me , I always regarded as a piece of good fortune " . 
 Ernest , like his brother , was in favor of a German unified , federal state . To best realize this goal , Ernest liked to <unk> in whatever political system promised the most success . He subsequently watched the growth of <unk> in Germany with much interest and tried to build links with the movement 's leaders . During Albert 's lifetime , Ernest took a close interest in the movement for reform , and was perceived as a progressive within Germany . His favorable view of <unk> caused his <unk> to become an <unk> for political refugees from other German states . In 1863 , he attended the liberal Frankfurt Conference , which was openly avoided by more conservative Prussia . Though his attendance made him no friends in Prussia , he developed such strong contacts in Austria that many looked to him as a potential leader in the mounting conflict between the northern and southern powers . He grew tired of the advice he received from Albert on the subject however ; as Ernest " was by no means inclined to consent to an energetic rule such as I adopted immediately afterwards for the perfection of the constitutional system " , according to Albert 's letters . 
 The Austro @-@ Prussian War was triggered by the desire of German conservative leaders to <unk> , albeit on different terms than their liberal counterparts . Ernest urged Prussian leaders against the impending war , and was an active advocate of the Austrian cause . Though Ernest normally followed more liberal politics than many of his counterparts , he began switching his views to align more closely with Prussian Minister President Otto von Bismarck by the mid @-@ 1860s . Despite this change in his private political views , he still had strong publicly known Austrian ties , and no one <unk> that Ernest would immediately side with the better @-@ equipped <unk> upon breakout of the war . His reasoning is usually understood as acting in the best interests of his <unk> , and by extension , of himself . Regardless , it was seen as a betrayal of former friends ; Queen Victoria commented that Ernest " might have agreed to neutrality - for that might be necessary , but to change colours I cannot think right " . 
 Ernest was fortunate in his support of victorious Prussia ; many other petty German <unk> , princes , and kings who had supported Austria suffered immensely at <unk> hands . Hanover , <unk> @-@ <unk> , and Nassau for instance were all annexed to Prussia at the expense of their respective rulers . Though he had only recently changed his political views , Ernest was allowed to ride at the head of his battalion during the victory parade . His eldest niece Prussian Crown Princess Victoria ( " <unk> " ) was for one pleased with his Prussian support and commented " I am not accustomed to hearing so much praise of <unk> here . [ Ernest ] was not among the crushed and beaten <unk> , it is sad enough as it is to see so many of one 's friends suffering from the effects of their <unk> " . Victoria 's husband Crown Prince Frederick was also pleased with Ernest 's decision , writing in his journal 28 September 1871 , that the duke 's " society always <unk> me peculiar pleasure , especially ... when his heart beats so warmly for Germany " . 
 Later in his reign , Ernest 's actions managed to continually anger his sister @-@ in @-@ law . Though Victoria loved Ernest because he was Albert 's brother , she was <unk> that Ernest was writing his memoirs , worrying about their contents mainly in regard to her dead husband . Despite their disputes , Ernest still met with Victoria and her family occasionally . In 1891 , they met in France ; Victoria 's lady @-@ in @-@ waiting commented " the old Duke of <unk> @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> has been here today with his wife . He is the Prince <unk> 's only brother and an awful looking man , the Queen dislikes him particularly . He is always writing anonymous pamphlets against the Queen and the Empress Frederick , which naturally creates a great deal of <unk> in the family " . 
 Throughout his reign , Ernest had been known for his extravagance and <unk> ; as he grew older , Ernest enjoyed gossip and was " now a thoroughly <unk> old <unk> who enjoyed the outrage provoked by his actions " , leading <unk> to declare that her uncle " was his own enemy " . His behavior and manner of dress increasingly became a joke for younger generations . His great @-@ niece Marie of Edinburgh would later describe Ernest as " an old <unk> , squeezed into a <unk> @-@ coat too tight for his bulk and <unk> <unk> in at the waist ' , sporting a top hat , lemon coloured gloves , and a <unk> in his <unk> " . He put on weight and though on paper his wealth was large , he was still constantly in debt . 
 Ernest II died at <unk> on 22 August 1893 after a short illness . A lifelong <unk> , his last words were apparently " Let the drive commence ! " His funeral was held in the <unk> in <unk> ; thousands of spectators came to the funeral , including Emperor Wilhelm and the Prince of Wales . He is buried in the <unk> mausoleum in the <unk> am <unk> which he himself had built in 1853 @-@ 8 . 
 For much of Ernest 's reign , the heir <unk> to <unk> @-@ <unk> and <unk> was his only sibling Prince Albert , consort of Queen Victoria . When it became increasingly more clear that Ernest would be <unk> , the possibility of a personal union between his <unk> and the United Kingdom became real , a reality that was deemed undesirable . Special arrangements were made by a combination of constitutional clauses and <unk> to pass Ernest 's throne to a son of Albert while preventing a personal union . Consequently , Prince Alfred , Duke of Edinburgh , his brother 's second eldest son , was designated the <unk> Ernest 's heir <unk> on 14 December 1861 , when his older brother the Prince of Wales ( later Edward VII of the United Kingdom ) <unk> his succession rights .

 <unk> Moor is a recreation area in <unk> , Greater Manchester , England which consists of eight hectares of moorland bounded by Moor Lane , <unk> Road , St. Paul 's <unk> and Singleton Brook . 
 <unk> Moor , first called <unk> or <unk> Moor , originally covered a much larger area , running down to the River <unk> . Evidence of activity during the Neolithic period has been discovered and the area was used by the Romans . It was the site of the first Manchester Racecourse and the second golf course to be built outside Scotland . It has been extensively used for other sporting <unk> , military manoeuvres and public gatherings such as the Great <unk> Meeting of 1838 , prompting the political theorist Friedrich <unk> to dub it " the <unk> <unk> of Manchester " . 
 With the increasing industrialisation and <unk> of Manchester and Salford during the 18th and 19th centuries , the moor became one of the remaining areas of natural landscape of interest to amateur naturalists , one of whom collected the only known specimens of the now extinct moth species <unk> <unk> . It is now a Site of Biological Importance and in 2007 was designated as a Local Nature Reserve by English Nature . 
 Flint <unk> , knives and other materials associated with <unk> humans were discovered on the moor in the late 19th and early 20th century by local <unk> such as Charles <unk> . The Roman road from Manchester ( <unk> ) to Ribchester ( <unk> ) roughly followed the line of the <unk> road ( Bury New Road ) which is just to the east of <unk> Moor . There was a Roman camp at <unk> just to the west , and some have speculated that there may have been a second camp to the east , in the area known as Castle Hill , making a defensive line across the moor to protect the north of <unk> . 
 " The moor of <unk> was in the time of the Romans , perhaps in that of the Britons before them , and for many ages after both , a thicket of oaks and a pasture for <unk> ; and the little <unk> , that so remarkably <unk> the plain , and are annually covered with <unk> crowds rising in ranks over ranks to the top , were once the occasional seats of the <unk> that <unk> these <unk> into the woods . " 
 The first Manchester <unk> was sited on the moor . The earliest record of horse @-@ racing is contained in the following notice in the London Gazette of 2 – 5 May <unk> : 
 On <unk> Moore near Manchester in Lancashire on the 18th instant , a 20 £ . plate will be run for to carry ten stone and ride three <unk> , four miles each heat . And the next day another plate of 40 £ . will be run for at the same <unk> , riding the same <unk> and carrying the same weight . The horses marks are to be given in four days before to Mr. William <unk> at the King 's Arms in Manchester . 
 During the 18th century the moor was also used for nude male races , allowing females to study the form before choosing their mates . Indeed , in 1796 Roger <unk> , known as " <unk> Roger " ( who was later a hero of the siege of Gibraltar ) acquired Hough Hall in <unk> through marriage to the widowed Barbara <unk> , after such a race . 
 The moor has also been used for a number of other sporting activities . In the 18th and early 19th century archery was still practised as a village sport , and the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> and Prestwich were renowned <unk> . The <unk> <unk> practised their sport on <unk> Moor and in 1793 the Manchester writer , James <unk> , composed a poem in praise of them , which begins : 
 By 1830 , however , archery had become the sport of gentlemen and an exclusive club called the " <unk> <unk> " was formed , the membership of which included some of the most influential men in the town . They originally met at a public house nicknamed " Hard Backed <unk> 's " on the site of <unk> where the Bishop of Manchester now resides , but after Bury New Road was built and the site became too public , they moved to the <unk> Tavern on <unk> Moor . In 1818 a golf course was founded on the moor for the Manchester Golf Club , a group of Manchester businessmen , some of whom had emigrated from Scotland . This was only the second course to be built outside Scotland . The course at that time consisted of only five holes and had no <unk> or <unk> as the players had to share the ground with other users . The club was very exclusive and by 1825 a club house had been built on Singleton Road . By 1869 the course had increased to nine holes and the club continued playing on the moor until 1862 when a new course was built a few hundred yards away at <unk> Vale . 
 The archery ground became <unk> Cricket Ground in 1847 and in 1881 the Northern Tennis Tournament was staged there . In 1919 the ground became the home of Manchester 's oldest rugby club , Manchester Football Club . When Manchester F.C. moved in 1968 they were replaced briefly by <unk> Juniors and then Salford City F.C. , who still lease the ground today . 
 As one of the largest open spaces close to Manchester , the moor has a history of use for army manoeuvres and large public gatherings . In his book The <unk> of the Working Class in England in 1844 , Friedrich <unk> referred to it as the <unk> <unk> of Manchester . This was a reference to the hill to which the <unk> ( common citizens ) of Rome withdrew en <unk> in <unk> BC as an act of civil protest . 
 The <unk> , Bolton and Rochdale Volunteers were reviewed on <unk> Moor on 25 August 1797 and in June 1812 , 30 @,@ 000 troops from the Wiltshire , Buckinghamshire , <unk> and <unk> regiments were camped there ready for action to suppress the <unk> . In 1818 a protest meeting was held on the moor by coal miners to <unk> their case for better pay , because of the dangers they faced at work . 
 A duel was fought on the moor in July 1804 between Mr. Jones and Mr. <unk> Philips . Mr. Jones fired at Mr. Philips without effect and Mr. Philips then fired his pistol in the air , upon which the seconds <unk> , the two man shook hands and honour was satisfied . Two weeks later , two other men who had been <unk> in the newspapers met on the moor to gain satisfaction . However , the magistrates had been informed and the men were arrested before the duel could take place . 
 On 12 April 1831 the 60th Rifle Corps had carried out an exercise on the moor under the command of Lieutenant <unk> Fitzgerald , and a detachment of 74 men were returning to their barracks in Salford by way of Lower <unk> and <unk> . As the men were crossing the <unk> <unk> Bridge , built four years earlier by <unk> 's father , they felt it begin to vibrate in time with their footsteps , and before they had reached the other side the bridge collapsed . Although no one was killed twenty men were injured , six of them seriously . It was this incident that caused the British Military to issue the order for soldiers to " break step " when crossing a bridge . 
 The largest of a series of <unk> meetings was held on the moor on 24 September 1838 . The meeting , which was planned as a show of strength and to elect delegates for the <unk> national convention , attracted speakers from all over the country and a massive crowd , which was estimated at 30 @,@ 000 by the Manchester Guardian and 300 @,@ 000 by the Morning Advertiser . 
 The <unk> were active for the next eight months but the poor attendance at a second meeting , held on the moor at the same time as a racing fixture on 25 May 1839 , signalled the end of the movement . Although the movement was not successful initially , most of the <unk> ' demands were eventually met by Parliament . 
 In 1848 , the moor was used as an encampment for the East Norfolk Regiment as part of an increased military presence in Lancashire brought about by the unrest caused by <unk> agitation . 
 The only specimen I have seen of this beautiful Moth , which is larger than the others , is a female ; it was taken on <unk> @-@ moor the middle of last June by Mr. R. Wood , of Manchester , to whom I have the pleasure of dedicating it ; — a most <unk> and successful naturalist , to whose <unk> I am indebted for many valuable insects . - John Curtis writing in British <unk> 1830 
 Enraged by this , and by accusations of <unk> passing off foreign <unk> as British , <unk> gave up collecting and left the rest of the specimens with his landlady as security for a debt . Here the stories from Manchester University and The Australian Museum , Victoria differ as to whether it was <unk> 's pub landlady or the landlady of his lodgings , but either way the result was the same . The debt was not paid on time and when <unk> went back for the <unk> , which he had already sold to another collector , his landlady had burnt them . Subsequent efforts by other collectors to find more of the <unk> were unsuccessful , and the three specimens left in existence are thought to be the only representatives of an extinct species . 
 Towards the end of the 19th century a Mr. <unk> <unk> contributed an article to the Journal of <unk> in which he gave a list of more than 240 plants and flowers , not including mosses , that he had found on the moor . 
 Shortly after <unk> on 10 September 1848 the " celebrated <unk> " George Gale ascended in a hot air balloon from <unk> Gardens in <unk> . After <unk> a number of fireworks from a height of over 1 @,@ 000 feet , Lieutenant Gale drifted in various directions and made abortive attempts to land in a number of locations . Eventually , at about <unk> , the balloon descended safely in the <unk> of Mr Josiah Taylor on <unk> Moor . 
 In 1852 , Queen Victoria commissioned a painting by the artist William <unk> which became A view of Manchester from <unk> Moor ( pictured ) . The painting , which depicts the moor as a beautiful pastoral scene overlooking Castle <unk> <unk> and the industrial landscape of Manchester , is now in the Royal Collection where it is listed as Manchester from Higher <unk> . A steel line engraving of the painting by the engraver Edward Goodall was also commissioned . 
 The English radical and writer Samuel <unk> mentions <unk> Moor in his book <unk> in the Life of a Radical ( 1840 – 1844 ) when he advises one of his friends to make his way from Middleton to Bolton via <unk> Moor to avoid the authorities : 
 <unk> I advised to go to his brother at Bolton , and get some money , and keep out of sight entirely , until something further was known . His best way would be to avoid Manchester , and go over <unk> moor and <unk> bridge ; and as I had a relation in that quarter who wished to see me , I would keep him company as far as <unk> . 
 The races on the moor were mentioned in the 19th @-@ century novel The Manchester Man by Mrs. G Linnaeus Banks ( 1874 ) . The hero of the story , <unk> <unk> , meets a street boy named Kit <unk> , of whom Mrs. Banks says : 
 He knew him to be not over @-@ <unk> . He had seen him at Knott Mill Fair and Dirt Fair ( so called from its being held in muddy November ) , or at <unk> Moor Races , with more money to spend in pop , nuts , and <unk> , shows and <unk> @-@ go @-@ rounds , flying boats and flying boxes , fighting <unk> and fighting men , than he could possibly have saved out of the sum his father allowed him for pocket @-@ money , even if he had been of the saving kind ; and , <unk> all these things together , <unk> was far from satisfied . 
 It is also mentioned in a collection of poems by Philip <unk> called " <unk> on <unk> " published in 1865 . 
 In 1876 the Lancashire dialect poet and songwriter Edwin <unk> moved from his Manchester home to <unk> Moor for the " <unk> air " . <unk> 's early life was spent in Rochdale and although he worked in Manchester he <unk> for the <unk> he remembered from his youth . He wrote the following poem about <unk> Moor 
 As his health declined , <unk> moved to the seaside town of New Brighton . On his death in 1890 , his body was brought back to be buried in the graveyard of St. Paul 's Church , on the edge of the moorland he loved so well . 
 <unk> was the dominant religion of the Jurchen people of northeast Asia and of their descendants , the <unk> people . As early as the Jin dynasty ( <unk> – 1234 ) , the Jurchens conducted <unk> ceremonies at shrines called <unk> . There were two kinds of shamans : those who entered in a trance and let themselves be possessed by the spirits , and those who conducted regular sacrifices to heaven , to a clan 's ancestors , or to the clan 's protective spirits . 
 During his <unk> among the <unk> populations of " <unk> " in the <unk> , Russian anthropologist S. M. <unk> found enough surviving practices to build a theory of <unk> that shaped later theoretical debates about <unk> . Since the late 1980s , however , these theories have been criticized for <unk> the relation between <unk> and the state . Historians are now arguing that <unk> practices in northeast Asia were intimately tied to the establishment of states , an analysis that fits the Qing case very well . 
 <unk> is the religion most typical of <unk> peoples of Northeast Asia . The word " <unk> " itself ( <unk> in the <unk> language ) appears in every <unk> @-@ <unk> language and seems to be of <unk> origins . The most common religion among the <unk> was <unk> , which they and their ancestors the Jurchens practiced long before their leaders conquered China as emperors of the Qing dynasty ( 1644 – 1911 ) . 
 There were two kinds of Jurchen <unk> rituals , corresponding to two kinds of shamans . The most common was " domestic ritual " : ritual @-@ based sacrifices to Heaven and to the clan 's ancestors conducted by hereditary shamans from that clan . " <unk> ritual , " on the other hand , was performed by people who had undergone a " <unk> illness , " which was seen as a sign that they had been chosen by the spirits . Entering into a trance , these " <unk> " shamans let themselves be possessed by various animal spirits and sought the help of these spirits for purposes like healing or <unk> . These shamans set up an altar in their own houses and received a different kind of training from hereditary shamans . 
 <unk> shamans typically wore an apron , a feathered cap denoting their ability to fly to the spirit world , and a belt with dangling bells , and carried a knife , two wooden sticks with bells affixed to the top , and a drum they used during ceremonies . These attributes could still be observed among shamans from <unk> and Mongolia in the early twentieth century . 
 <unk> could also be used for personal purposes , as when <unk> 's eldest son <unk> supposedly tried to <unk> the entire <unk> <unk> lineage with the help of shamans in 1612 . 
 In 1644 , just a few months after the Qing seized the city of Beijing from the peasant rebels who had pushed the last emperor of the Ming dynasty to suicide , the <unk> constructed a new <unk> in the city , modeled on the <unk> of the former Qing capital <unk> . This " <unk> <unk> sanctuary , " an octagonal building whose shape was specific to the <unk> <unk> clan , was located outside the Imperial City to the southeast , but still within the Inner City occupied by <unk> , making it convenient for imperial visits . There , the emperor made offerings to Heaven and various other deities , including the horse spirit and the <unk> progenitor . Chinese and Mongols were strictly forbidden from entering this ritual area . 
 The <unk> was destroyed in 1900 by foreign powers in the aftermath of the <unk> Uprising as part of <unk> for the two @-@ month siege of the international <unk> Quarter . A new shrine was rebuilt inside the palace in December 1901 . Its former site became part of the expanded Italian <unk> . Historian Mark Elliott notes that in today 's Beijing , the old <unk> would have been located on East Chang 'an Avenue , " directly opposite the ' modern ' wing of the Beijing Hotel . " 
 Daily <unk> rites were also conducted in the women 's quarters , in the Palace of <unk> <unk> ( Chinese : <unk> ; pinyin : <unk> <unk> ) , a building located near the north gate of the Forbidden City , on the central axis of the palace complex . This palace had served as the Empress 's residence under the Ming dynasty , but the Qing converted it for ritual use , installing a " spirit pole " to present sacrifices to heaven , changing the style of the windows , and setting up large <unk> to cook sacrificial food . 
 The worship of heaven in the Chinese imperial tradition paralleled <unk> sacrifices , but only the emperor made offerings to the Chinese heaven , whereas ordinary <unk> could also worship <unk> heaven . Both Chinese and <unk> heaven were an " all @-@ encompassing principle of cosmic order and human destiny " that could be used to give the state legitimacy . 
 <unk> is a mathematical operation , written as <unk> , involving two numbers , the base b and the exponent n . When n is a positive <unk> , <unk> corresponds to repeated <unk> of the base : that is , <unk> is the product of <unk> n bases : 
 The exponent is usually shown as a <unk> to the right of the base . Some common <unk> have their own names : the exponent 2 ( or 2nd power ) is called the square of b ( <unk> ) or b <unk> ; the exponent 3 ( or 3rd power ) is called the <unk> of b ( <unk> ) or b <unk> . The exponent − 1 of b , or 1 / b , is called the <unk> of b . 
 When n is a negative <unk> and b is not zero , <unk> is naturally defined as 1 / b − n , preserving the property <unk> × <unk> = <unk> + m . 
 The definition of <unk> can be extended to allow any real or complex exponent . <unk> by <unk> <unk> can also be defined for a wide variety of <unk> structures , including matrices . 
 <unk> is used extensively in many fields , including economics , biology , chemistry , physics , and computer science , with applications such as compound interest , population growth , chemical reaction <unk> , wave behavior , and public @-@ key <unk> . 
 The term power was used by the Greek mathematician Euclid for the square of a line . <unk> discovered and proved the law of <unk> , <unk> <unk> 
 Early in the 17th century , the first form of our modern exponential <unk> was introduced by <unk> <unk> in his text titled La <unk> ; there , the <unk> is introduced in Book I. 
 Some mathematicians ( e.g. , Isaac Newton ) used <unk> only for powers greater than two , preferring to represent squares as repeated <unk> . Thus they would write <unk> , for example , as <unk> + <unk> + <unk> + d . 
 Another historical synonym , <unk> , is now rare and should not be confused with its more common meaning . 
 In 1748 <unk> <unk> wrote " consider <unk> or powers in which the exponent itself is a variable . It is clear that quantities of this kind are not <unk> functions , since in those the <unk> must be constant . " With this introduction of <unk> functions , <unk> laid the foundation for the modern introduction of natural <unk> as the <unk> function for y = 
 b <unk> b <unk> b is called the <unk> of b because the volume of a <unk> with side @-@ length b is <unk> . It is pronounced " b <unk> " . 
 243 . The base 3 appears 5 times in the repeated <unk> , because the exponent is 5 . Here , 3 is the base , 5 is the exponent , and 243 is the power or , more specifically , the fifth power of 3 , 3 raised to the fifth power , or 3 to the power of 5 . 
 The word " raised " is usually omitted , and very often " power " as well , so 35 is typically pronounced " three to the fifth " or " three to the five " . The <unk> <unk> can be read as b raised to the n @-@ <unk> power , or b raised to the power of n , or b raised by the exponent of n , or most briefly as b to the n . 
 Any <unk> number raised by the exponent 0 is 1 ; one interpretation of such a power is as an empty product . The case of 00 is discussed below . 
 The identity above may be derived through a definition aimed at extending the range of <unk> to negative <unk> . 
 For non @-@ zero b and positive n , the recurrence relation from the previous <unk> can be rewritten as 
 For <unk> <unk> n and m , the power nm is the number of functions from a set of m elements to a set of n elements ( see cardinal <unk> ) . Such functions can be represented as m @-@ <unk> from an n @-@ element set ( or as m @-@ letter words from an n @-@ letter alphabet ) . 
 24 , but 23 to the 4 is 84 or <unk> , whereas 2 to the 34 is 281 or <unk> . Without parentheses to modify the order of calculation , by convention the order is top @-@ down , not bottom @-@ up : 
 While Google and <unk> follow the above convention , note that some computer programs such as Microsoft Office <unk> or <unk> associate to the left instead , i.e. a ^ b ^ c is evaluated as ( a ^ b ) ^ c . 
 In the base ten ( <unk> ) number system , <unk> powers of 10 are written as the digit 1 followed or preceded by a number of <unk> determined by the sign and magnitude of the exponent . For example , 103 
 <unk> with base 10 is used in scientific <unk> to denote large or small numbers . For instance , <unk> m / s ( the speed of light in vacuum , in metres per second ) can be written as 2 @.@ <unk> × 108 m / s and then <unk> as 2 @.@ <unk> × 108 m / s . 
 <unk> <unk> based on powers of 10 are also used to describe small or large quantities . For example , the prefix <unk> means 103 = 1000 , so a kilometre is 1000 m . 
 The positive powers of 2 are important in computer science because there are <unk> possible values for an n @-@ bit binary register . 
 Powers of 2 are important in set theory since a set with n members has a power set , or set of all <unk> of the original set , with <unk> members . 
 The negative powers of 2 are commonly used , and the first two have special names : half , and quarter . 
 In the base 2 ( binary ) number system , <unk> powers of 2 are written as 1 followed or preceded by a number of <unk> determined by the sign and magnitude of the exponent . For example , two to the power of three is written as 1000 in binary . 
 If the exponent is negative , the power of zero ( <unk> , where n < 0 ) is <unk> , because division by zero is implied . 
 Because of this , powers of − 1 are useful for expressing alternating sequences . For a similar discussion of powers of the complex number i , see § Powers of complex numbers . 
 The limit of a sequence of powers of a number greater than one <unk> ; in other words , the sequence grows without bound : 
 This can be read as " b to the power of n tends to + <unk> as n tends to <unk> when b is greater than one " . 
 If the number b varies tending to 1 as the exponent tends to <unk> then the limit is not necessarily one of those above . A particularly important case is 
 Other limits , in particular of those that take on an indeterminate form , are described in § <unk> of powers below . 
 If b is a positive real number and n is a positive <unk> , then there is exactly one positive real solution to <unk> = 
 b . This solution is called the principal <unk> root of b . It is denoted n <unk> b , where <unk> is the radical symbol ; alternatively , the principal root may be written <unk> / n . For example : 41 / 2 
 b has one real solution . The solution is positive if b is positive and negative if b is negative . 
 The principal root of a positive real number b with a rational exponent u / v in lowest terms <unk> 
 <unk> powers u / v , where u / v is in lowest terms , are positive if u is even ( and hence v is odd ) ( because then <unk> is positive ) , and negative for negative b if u and v are odd ( because then <unk> is negative ) . There are two roots , one of each sign , if b is positive and v is even ( as exemplified by the case in which u 
 2 , whereby a positive b has two square roots ) ; in this case the principal root is defined to be the positive one . 
 9 . The number 4 has two 3 / <unk> roots , namely 8 and − 8 ; however , by convention 43 / 2 denotes the principal root , which is 8 . Since there is no real number x such that <unk> 
 Care needs to be taken when applying the power identities with negative <unk> roots . For instance , − 27 = 
 93 / 2 = 27 is clearly wrong . The problem here occurs in taking the positive square root rather than the negative one at the last step , but in general the same sorts of problems occur as described for complex numbers in the section § <unk> of power and <unk> identities . 
 The identities and properties shown above for <unk> <unk> are true for positive real numbers with non @-@ <unk> <unk> as well . However the identity 
 cannot be extended consistently to cases where b is a negative real number ( see § Real <unk> with negative bases ) . The failure of this identity is the basis for the problems with complex number powers detailed under § <unk> of power and <unk> identities . 
 <unk> to real powers of positive real numbers can be defined either by extending the rational powers to <unk> by continuity , or more usually as given in § Powers via <unk> below . 
 Since any irrational number can be expressed as the limit of a sequence of rational numbers , <unk> of a positive real number b with an arbitrary real exponent x can be defined by continuity with the rule 
 where the limit as r gets close to x is taken only over rational values of r . This limit only exists for positive b . The ( <unk> , <unk> ) <unk> of limit is used , this involves showing that for any desired accuracy of the result <unk> one can choose a sufficiently small interval around x so all the rational powers in the interval are within the desired accuracy . 
 3 @.@ <unk> ... can be used ( based on strict <unk> of the rational power ) to obtain the intervals bounded by rational powers 
 The bounded intervals converge to a unique real number , denoted by <formula> . This technique can be used to obtain the power of a positive real number b for any irrational exponent . The function <unk> ( x ) = <unk> is thus defined for any real number x . 
 As a consequence , the <unk> ex usually denotes a <unk> <unk> definition called the exponential function , <unk> ( x ) , which can be defined in many equivalent ways , for example by : 
 The exponential function is defined for all <unk> , <unk> , real , and complex values of x . In fact , the matrix exponential is well @-@ defined for square matrices ( in which case this exponential identity only holds when x and y commute ) , and is useful for solving systems of linear <unk> <unk> . 
 Since <unk> ( 1 ) is equal to e and <unk> ( x ) <unk> this exponential identity , it immediately follows that <unk> ( x ) <unk> with the repeated @-@ <unk> definition of ex for <unk> x , and it also follows that rational powers denote ( positive ) roots as usual , so <unk> ( x ) <unk> with the ex definitions in the previous section for all real x by continuity . 
 The natural <unk> <unk> ( x ) is the <unk> of the exponential function ex . It is defined for b > 0 , and <unk> 
 This can be used as an alternative definition of the real number power <unk> and agrees with the definition given above using rational <unk> and continuity . The definition of <unk> using <unk> is more common in the context of complex numbers , as discussed below . 
 Neither the <unk> method nor the rational exponent method can be used to define <unk> as a real number for a negative real number b and an arbitrary real number r . Indeed , er is positive for every real number r , so <unk> ( b ) is not defined as a real number for b ≤ 0 . 
 The rational exponent method cannot be used for negative values of b because it relies on continuity . The function f ( r ) = 
 <unk> has a unique continuous extension from the rational numbers to the real numbers for each b > 0 . But when b < 0 , the function f is not even continuous on the set of rational numbers r for which it is defined . 
 1 is dense in the rational numbers , as is the set of q for which ( − 1 ) q = − 1 . This means that the function ( − 1 ) q is not continuous at any rational number q where it is defined . 
 On the other hand , arbitrary complex powers of negative numbers b can be defined by choosing a complex <unk> of b . 
 If a is a positive <unk> number , and b is a rational number , it has been shown above that ab is <unk> . This remains true even if one accepts any <unk> number for a , with the only difference that ab may take several values ( see below ) , all <unk> . <unk> – Schneider theorem provides some information on the nature of ab when b is irrational ( that is not rational ) . It states : 
 If a is an <unk> number different from 0 and 1 , and b an irrational <unk> number , then all the values of ab are <unk> numbers ( that is , not <unk> ) . 
 A complex number is an expression of the form <formula> , where x and y are real numbers , and i is the so @-@ called imaginary unit , a number that <unk> the rule <formula> . A complex number can be visualized as a point in the ( x , y ) plane . The polar coordinates of a point in the ( x , y ) plane consist of a non @-@ negative real number r and angle <unk> such that x 
 <unk> + <unk> is obtained by expanding out the product of the <unk> and <unk> using the rule <formula> : 
 <unk> the right triangle in the complex plane which has 0 , 1 , 1 + <unk> / n as vertices . For large values of n , the triangle is almost a circular sector with a radius of 1 and a small central angle equal to x / n <unk> . 1 + <unk> / n may then be <unk> by the number with polar coordinates ( 1 , x / n ) . So , in the limit as n approaches <unk> , ( 1 + <unk> / n ) n approaches ( 1 , x / n ) n 
 ( 1 , x ) , the point on the unit circle whose angle from the positive real axis is x <unk> . The <unk> coordinates of this point are ( <unk> x , sin x ) . So e <unk> 
 Before the invention of complex numbers , <unk> and <unk> were defined <unk> . The above formula reduces the complicated formulas for <unk> functions of a sum into the simple <unk> formula 
 The power <unk> = ex + <unk> can be computed as ex <unk> <unk> . The real factor ex is the absolute value of <unk> and the complex factor <unk> identifies the direction of <unk> . 
 If b is a positive real number , and <unk> is any complex number , the power <unk> is defined as <unk> <unk> <unk> ( b ) , where x 
 The identity ( <unk> ) u = <unk> is not generally valid for complex powers . The power <unk> is a complex number and any power of it has to follow the rules for powers of complex numbers below . A simple <unk> is given by : 
 <unk> powers of <unk> complex numbers are defined by repeated <unk> or division as above . If i is the imaginary unit and n is an <unk> , then in equals 1 , i , − 1 , or − i , according to whether the <unk> n is <unk> to 0 , 1 , 2 , or 3 <unk> 4 . Because of this , the powers of i are useful for expressing sequences of period 4 . 
 Complex powers of positive <unk> are defined via ex as in section Complex <unk> with positive real bases above . These are continuous functions . 
 <unk> to extend these functions to the general case of <unk> powers of complex numbers that are not positive <unk> leads to difficulties . Either we define <unk> functions or <unk> functions . Neither of these options is entirely satisfactory . 
 The rational power of a complex number must be the solution to an <unk> equation . Therefore , it always has a finite number of possible values . For example , w 
 <unk> . But if w is a solution , then so is − w , because ( − 1 ) 2 = 1 . A unique but somewhat arbitrary solution called the principal value can be chosen using a general rule which also applies for <unk> powers . 
 Complex powers and <unk> are more naturally handled as single valued functions on a <unk> surface . Single valued versions are defined by choosing a sheet . The value has a <unk> along a branch cut . <unk> one out of many solutions as the principal value leaves us with functions that are not continuous , and the usual rules for manipulating powers can lead us astray . 
 Any <unk> power of a complex number has an infinite number of possible values because of the multi @-@ valued nature of the complex <unk> . The principal value is a single value chosen from these by a rule which , amongst its other properties , ensures powers of complex numbers with a positive real part and zero imaginary part give the same value as does the rule defined above for the corresponding real base . 
 <unk> a real number to a complex power is formally a different operation from that for the corresponding complex number . However , in the common case of a positive real number the principal value is the same . 
 The powers of negative real numbers are not always defined and are <unk> even where defined . In fact , they are only defined when the exponent is a rational number with the <unk> being an odd <unk> . When dealing with complex numbers the complex number operation is normally used instead . 
 For complex numbers w and <unk> with w <unk> 0 , the <unk> <unk> is ambiguous in the same sense that log w is . 
 To obtain a value of <unk> , first choose a <unk> of w ; call it log w . Such a choice may be the principal value <unk> w ( the default , if no other specification is given ) , or perhaps a value given by some other branch of log w fixed in advance . Then , using the complex exponential function one defines 
 because this agrees with the earlier definition in the case where w is a positive real number and the ( real ) principal value of log w is used . 
 If <unk> is an <unk> , then the value of <unk> is independent of the choice of log w , and it agrees with the earlier definition of <unk> with an <unk> exponent . 
 If <unk> is a rational number m / n in lowest terms with <unk> > 0 , then the <unk> infinitely many choices of log w yield only n different values for <unk> ; these values are the n complex solutions s to the equation <unk> = <unk> . 
 If <unk> is an irrational number , then the <unk> infinitely many choices of log w lead to infinitely many distinct values for <unk> . 
 The computation of complex powers is facilitated by converting the base w to polar form , as described in detail below . 
 1 but <unk> <unk> 1 for all natural numbers k such that 0 < k < n , then w is called a primitive <unk> root of unity . The negative unit − 1 is the only primitive square root of unity . The imaginary unit i is one of the two primitive 4th roots of unity ; the other one is − i . 
 The number <unk> / n is the primitive <unk> root of unity with the smallest positive argument . ( It is sometimes called the principal <unk> root of unity , although this terminology is not universal and should not be confused with the principal value of n <unk> 1 , which is 1 . ) 
 Although there are infinitely many possible values for a general complex <unk> , there are only a finite number of values for the power <unk> in the important special case where q 
 w . As with real roots , a second root is also called a square root and a third root is also called a <unk> root . 
 It is conventional in mathematics to define <unk> / n as the principal value of the root . If w is a positive real number , it is also conventional to select a positive real number as the principal value of the root <unk> / n . For general complex numbers , the <unk> root with the smallest argument is often selected as the principal value of the <unk> root operation , as with principal values of roots of unity . 
 The set of <unk> roots of a complex number w is obtained by <unk> the principal value <unk> / n by each of the <unk> roots of unity . For example , the fourth roots of 16 are 2 , − 2 , <unk> , and − <unk> , because the principal value of the fourth root of 16 is 2 and the fourth roots of unity are 1 , − 1 , i , and − i . 
 It is often easier to <unk> complex powers by writing the number to be <unk> in polar form . Every complex number <unk> can be written in the polar form 
 where r is a <unk> real number and <unk> is the ( real ) argument of <unk> . The polar form has a simple <unk> interpretation : if a complex number u + <unk> is thought of as representing a point ( u , v ) in the complex plane using <unk> coordinates , then ( r , <unk> ) is the same point in polar coordinates . That is , r is the " radius " <unk> 
 <unk> ( v , u ) . The polar angle <unk> is ambiguous since any <unk> multiple of <unk> could be added to <unk> without changing the location of the point . Each choice of <unk> gives in general a different possible value of the power . A branch cut can be used to choose a specific value . The principal value ( the most common branch cut ) , corresponds to <unk> chosen in the interval ( − <unk> , <unk> ] . For complex numbers with a positive real part and zero imaginary part using the principal value gives the same result as using the corresponding real number . 
 This final formula allows complex powers to be computed easily from <unk> of the base into polar form and the exponent into <unk> form . It is shown here both in polar form and in <unk> form ( via <unk> 's identity ) . 
 The following examples use the principal value , the branch cut which causes <unk> to be in the interval ( − <unk> , <unk> ] . To <unk> ii , write i in polar and <unk> forms : 
 The value of a complex power depends on the branch used . For example , if the polar form i = <unk> / 2 is used to <unk> ii , the power is found to be e − <unk> / 2 ; the principal value of ii , computed above , is e − <unk> / 2 . The set of all possible values for ii is given by : 
 So there is an <unk> of values which are possible candidates for the value of ii , one for each <unk> k . All of them have a zero imaginary part so one can say ii has an <unk> of valid real values . 
 Some identities for powers and <unk> for positive real numbers will fail for complex numbers , no matter how complex powers and complex <unk> are defined as single @-@ valued functions . For example : 
 Regardless of which branch of the <unk> is used , a similar failure of the identity will exist . The best that can be said ( if only using this result ) is that : 
 This identity does not hold even when considering log as a <unk> function . The possible values of log ( <unk> ) contain those of <unk> <unk> log w as a subset . Using <unk> ( w ) for the principal value of log ( w ) and m , n as any <unk> the possible values of both sides are : 
 On the other hand , when x is an <unk> , the identities are valid for all <unk> complex numbers . 
 If <unk> is considered as a <unk> function then the possible values of ( − 1 × − 1 ) 1 / 2 are <unk> 1 , − 1 <unk> . The identity holds but saying <unk> 1 <unk> = 
 The identity ( ex ) y = <unk> holds for real numbers x and y , but assuming its truth for complex numbers leads to the following paradox , discovered in 1827 by <unk> : For any <unk> n , we have : 
 The major error is that changing the order of <unk> in going from line two to three changes what the principal value chosen will be . 
 From the multi @-@ valued point of view , the first error occurs even sooner . <unk> in the first line is that e is a real number , whereas the result of <unk> + <unk> is a complex number better represented as e + <unk> . <unk> the complex number for the real on the second line makes the power have multiple possible values . Changing the order of <unk> from lines two to three also affects how many possible values the result can have . <formula> , but rather <formula> <unk> over <unk> n . 
 <unk> can be defined in any <unk> . A <unk> is an <unk> structure consisting of a set X together with a rule for composition ( " <unk> " ) satisfying an <unk> law and a <unk> identity , denoted by 1 . <unk> is defined <unk> by : 
 <unk> include many structures of importance in mathematics , including groups and rings ( under <unk> ) , with more specific examples of the latter being matrix rings and fields . 
 If A is a square matrix , then the product of A with itself n times is called the matrix power . Also <formula> is defined to be the identity matrix , and if A is <unk> , then <formula> . 
 Matrix powers appear often in the context of discrete <unk> systems , where the matrix A expresses a transition from a state vector x of some system to the next state <unk> of the system . This is the standard interpretation of a <unk> chain , for example . Then <formula> is the state of the system after two time steps , and so forth : <formula> is the state of the system after n time steps . The matrix power <formula> is the transition matrix between the state now and the state at a time n steps in the future . So computing matrix powers is equivalent to solving the evolution of the <unk> system . In many cases , matrix powers can be <unk> computed by using <unk> and <unk> . 
 Apart from matrices , more general linear operators can also be <unk> . An example is the derivative operator of <unk> , <formula> , which is a linear operator acting on functions <formula> to give a new function <formula> . The n @-@ <unk> power of the differentiation operator is the n @-@ <unk> derivative : 
 A field is an <unk> structure in which <unk> , addition , <unk> , and division are all well @-@ defined and satisfy their familiar properties . The real numbers , for example , form a field , as do the complex numbers and rational numbers . Unlike these familiar examples of fields , which are all infinite sets , some fields have only <unk> many elements . The simplest example is the field with two elements <formula> with addition defined by <formula> and <formula> , and <unk> <formula> and <formula> . 
 <unk> in finite fields has applications in public key <unk> . For example , the <unk> – <unk> key exchange uses the fact that <unk> is <unk> inexpensive in finite fields , whereas the discrete <unk> ( the <unk> of <unk> ) is <unk> expensive . 
 Any finite field F has the property that there is a unique prime number p such that <formula> for all x in F ; that is , x added to itself p times is zero . For example , in <formula> , the prime number p = 2 has this property . This prime number is called the characteristic of the field . <unk> that F is a field of characteristic p , and consider the function <formula> that raises each element of F to the power p . This is called the <unk> <unk> of F. It is an <unk> of the field because of the Freshman 's dream identity <formula> . The <unk> <unk> is important in number theory because it generates the <unk> group of F over its prime <unk> . 
 Let X be a set with a power @-@ <unk> binary operation which is written <unk> . Then <unk> is defined for any element x of X and any <unk> natural number n as the product of n copies of x , which is <unk> defined by 
 If the operation has a two @-@ sided identity element 1 , then <unk> is defined to be equal to 1 for any x . 
 If the operation also has two @-@ sided <unk> and is <unk> , then the <unk> is a group . The <unk> of x can be denoted by x − 1 and follows all the usual rules for <unk> . 
 If the binary operation is written <unk> , as it often is for <unk> groups , then " <unk> is repeated <unk> " can be <unk> as " <unk> is repeated addition " . Thus , each of the laws of <unk> above has an <unk> among laws of <unk> . 
 When there are several power @-@ <unk> binary operations defined on a set , any of which might be <unk> , it is common to indicate which operation is being repeated by placing its symbol in the <unk> . Thus , x <unk> n is x <unk> ... <unk> x , while x # n is x # ... # x , whatever the operations <unk> and # might be . 
 If n is a natural number and A is an arbitrary set , the expression An is often used to denote the set of ordered n @-@ <unk> of elements of A. This is equivalent to letting An denote the set of functions from the set <unk> 0 , 1 , 2 , ... , n − 1 <unk> to the set A ; the n @-@ <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , ... , an − 1 ) represents the function that sends i to <unk> . 
 For an infinite cardinal number <unk> and a set A , the <unk> <unk> is also used to denote the set of all functions from a set of size <unk> to A. This is sometimes written <unk> to distinguish it from cardinal <unk> , defined below . 
 This <unk> exponential can also be defined for operations on sets or for sets with extra structure . For example , in linear algebra , it makes sense to index direct sums of vector spaces over arbitrary index sets . That is , we can speak of 
 If the base of the <unk> operation is a set , the <unk> operation is the <unk> product unless otherwise stated . Since multiple <unk> products produce an n @-@ <unk> , which can be represented by a function on a set of appropriate <unk> , SN becomes simply the set of all functions from N to S in this case : 
 | S | | N | , where | X | is the <unk> of X. When " 2 " is defined as <unk> 0 , 1 <unk> , we have | <unk> | = 2 | X | , where <unk> , usually denoted by P ( X ) , is the power set of X ; each subset Y of X corresponds uniquely to a function on X taking the value 1 for x <unk> Y and 0 for x <unk> <unk> 
 In a <unk> closed category , the exponential operation can be used to raise an arbitrary object to the power of another object . This <unk> the <unk> product in the category of sets . If 0 is an initial object in a <unk> closed category , then the exponential object 00 is <unk> to any terminal object 1 . 
 <unk> of cardinal numbers is distinct from <unk> of <unk> numbers , which is defined by a limit process involving <unk> induction . 
 There are many widely used formulas having terms involving natural @-@ number <unk> that require 00 to be evaluated to 1 . For example , regarding <unk> as an empty product assigns it the value 1 , even when b 
 0 . <unk> , the set @-@ <unk> interpretation of 00 is the number of functions from the empty set to the empty set ; there is exactly one such function , the empty function . 
 This perspective is significant for many polynomial identities appearing in <unk> . For example , the binomial theorem <formula> is not valid for x 
 1 . Similarly , rings of power series require <formula> to be true for all <unk> of x . Thus identities like <formula> and <formula> are only true as functional identities ( including at x 
 <unk> involving <unk> operations can often be evaluated by replacing <unk> by their limits ; if the resulting expression does not determine the original limit , the expression is known as an indeterminate form . In fact , when f ( t ) and g ( t ) are real @-@ valued functions both approaching 0 ( as t approaches a real number or ± <unk> ) , with f ( t ) > 0 , the function f ( t ) g ( t ) need not approach 1 ; depending on f and g , the limit of f ( t ) g ( t ) can be any <unk> real number or + <unk> , or it can <unk> . For example , the functions below are of the form f ( t ) g ( t ) with f ( t ) , g ( t ) → 0 as t → 0 + , but the limits are different : 
 Thus , the two @-@ variable function <unk> , though continuous on the set <unk> ( x , y ) : x > 0 <unk> , cannot be extended to a continuous function on any set containing ( 0 , 0 ) , no matter how one chooses to define 00 . However , under certain conditions , such as when f and g are both <unk> functions and f is positive on the open interval ( 0 , b ) for some positive b , the limit approaching from the right is always 1 . 
 In the complex domain , the function <unk> may be defined for <unk> <unk> by choosing a branch of log <unk> and defining <unk> as <unk> log <unk> . This does not define <unk> since there is no branch of log <unk> defined at <unk> = 0 , let alone in a neighborhood of 0 . 
 The debate over the definition of <formula> has been going on at least since the early 19th century . At that time , most mathematicians agreed that <formula> , until in 1821 <unk> listed <formula> along with expressions like <formula> in a table of indeterminate forms . In the 1830s <unk> published an <unk> argument for <formula> , and <unk> sided with him , erroneously claiming that <formula> whenever <formula> . A commentator who signed his name simply as " S " provided the <unk> of <formula> , and this <unk> the debate for some time . More historical details can be found in <unk> ( 1992 ) . 
 Some argue that the best value for <formula> depends on context , and hence that defining it once and for all is problematic . According to Benson ( 1999 ) , " The choice whether to define <formula> is based on convenience , not on <unk> . If we refrain from defining <formula> then certain <unk> become <unk> awkward . The consensus is to use the definition <formula> , although there are textbooks that refrain from defining <formula> . " 
 Others argue that <formula> should be defined as 1 . <unk> ( 1992 ) contends strongly that <formula> " has to be 1 " , drawing a distinction between the value <formula> , which should equal 1 as advocated by <unk> , and the limiting form <formula> ( an abbreviation for a limit of <formula> where <formula> ) , which is necessarily an indeterminate form as listed by <unk> : " Both <unk> and <unk> were right , but <unk> and his defenders did not understand why truth was on their side . " 
 The <unk> 754 @-@ 2008 floating point standard is used in the design of most floating point libraries . It recommends a number of functions for computing a power : 
 <unk> treats 00 as 1 . This is the oldest defined version . If the power is an exact <unk> the result is the same as for <unk> , otherwise the result is as for <unk> ( except for some exceptional cases ) . 
 <unk> treats 00 as 1 . The power must be an exact <unk> . The value is defined for negative bases ; e.g. , <unk> ( − 3 @,@ 5 ) is − 243 . 
 <unk> treats 00 as <unk> ( Not @-@ a @-@ Number – <unk> ) . The value is also <unk> for cases like <unk> ( − 3 @,@ 2 ) where the base is less than zero . The value is defined by <unk> × log ( base ) . 
 Most programming language with a power function are implemented using the <unk> <unk> function and therefore evaluate 00 as 1 . The later C and C + + standards describe this as the <unk> behaviour . The Java standard <unk> this behavior . The <unk> <unk> method <unk> also treats 00 as 1 . 
 Sage <unk> <unk> to 1 , even if no constraints are placed on b . It takes 00 to be 1 , but does not <unk> <unk> for other x . 
 <unk> also <unk> <unk> to 1 even if no constraints are placed on b , but issues an error for 00 . For x > 0 , it <unk> <unk> to 0 . 
 <unk> and <unk> Alpha <unk> <unk> into 1 , even if no constraints are placed on b . While <unk> does not <unk> <unk> , <unk> Alpha returns two results , 0 for x > 0 , and " indeterminate " for real x . Both <unk> and <unk> Alpha take 00 to be " ( indeterminate ) " . 
 <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , singular , <unk> / <unk> and the Google and <unk> calculators evaluate 00 as 1 . 
 The section § Zero to the power of zero gives a number of examples of limits that are of the indeterminate form 00 . The limits in these examples exist , but have different values , showing that the two @-@ variable function <unk> has no limit at the point ( 0 , 0 ) . One may consider at what points this function does have a limit . 
 <unk> ( x , y ) <unk> <unk> : x > 0 <unk> . Then D can be viewed as a subset of <unk> ( that is , the set of all pairs ( x , y ) with x , y belonging to the extended real number line R 
 These powers are obtained by taking limits of <unk> for positive values of x . This method does not permit a definition of <unk> when x < 0 , since pairs ( x , y ) with x < 0 are not <unk> points of D. 
 On the other hand , when n is an <unk> , the power <unk> is already meaningful for all values of x , including negative ones . This may make the definition <unk> = 
 + <unk> obtained above for negative n problematic when n is odd , since in this case <unk> → + <unk> as x tends to 0 through positive values , but not negative ones . 
 Computing <unk> using <unk> <unk> requires n − 1 <unk> operations , but it can be computed more efficiently than that , as illustrated by the following example . To <unk> 2100 , note that 100 
 This series of steps only requires 8 <unk> operations instead of 99 ( since the last product above takes 2 <unk> ) . 
 <unk> an <unk> <unk> after the name or symbol of a function , as if the function were being raised to a power , commonly refers to repeated function composition rather than repeated <unk> . Thus , f 3 ( x ) may mean f ( f ( f ( x ) ) ) ; in particular , f − 1 ( x ) usually denotes the <unk> function of f . <unk> functions are of interest in the study of <unk> and <unk> systems . <unk> was the first to study the problem of finding a functional square root f 1 / 2 ( x ) . 
 <unk> x , as well as for its <unk> , for example <unk> − 1 x = <unk> x . A similar convention applies to <unk> , where <unk> x usually means ( log x ) 2 , not log log x . 
 The <unk> <unk> <unk> is convenient in handwriting but <unk> for typewriters and computer terminals that align the <unk> of all characters on each line . Many programming languages have alternate ways of expressing <unk> that do not use <unk> : 
 In <unk> , C , C + + , C # , D , Go , Java , <unk> , <unk> , PHP , <unk> and Ruby , the symbol ^ represents <unk> <unk> . In Pascal , it represents <unk> . In <unk> and Standard ML , it represents string <unk> . 
 <unk> v. <unk> , 60 U.S. ( 19 How . ) 366 ( 1857 ) , is a United States Supreme Court decision involving Native American law . John <unk> , a <unk> Seneca , sued agents of the <unk> Land Company for common law claims of <unk> , assault , and battery after he was forcibly evicted from his sawmill by the Company 's agents . The Court affirmed a judgement in <unk> 's favor , <unk> the fact that the Seneca had executed an Indian removal treaty and the Company held the exclusive right to purchase to the land by virtue of an <unk> compact ratified by Congress . 
 Citing the trust relationship between the federal government and the tribes , the Court held that removal treaties could only be enforced against the tribes by the federal government , not private parties ( whether through self @-@ help or through the courts ) . In other words , the federal government retained the discretion not to enforce such treaties . At the same time , the Court held that enrolled treaties are conclusively valid , and refused to consider the <unk> claim that the Treaty of Buffalo Creek ( 1838 ) was <unk> . 
 <unk> was one of several encounters of the <unk> Court with the aboriginal title . It was the first litigation of aboriginal title in the United States in the Court by an indigenous <unk> since <unk> Nation v. Georgia ( 1831 ) . According to a contemporary New York Times article : " The questions involved are of great magnitude , and affect more or less the title to a large portion of the State of New York . " In <unk> , the court found " its first opportunity to consider the power of the federal government over Indian lands in New York . " Following the <unk> of the Marshall Court , <unk> was " decided at a time when the government was still dealing with Indian tribes as if they were semi @-@ sovereign nations . " 
 The Marshall Court ( 1801 — 1835 ) had repeatedly taken up the issue of aboriginal title in the United States . However , with the exception of <unk> Nation v. Georgia ( 1831 ) , which was dismissed for lack of original jurisdiction , all the disputes had been between non @-@ Indians — typically between those who derived their title from the government and those who derived their title from private purchases from Indians . The uniform rule of these cases , <unk> most clearly in Johnson v. M <unk> ( 1823 ) , was that non @-@ Indians could not acquire valid land title from such private purchases . However , the purchase at issue in <unk> , the Treaty of Buffalo Creek ( 1838 ) , had been ratified by the federal government . 
 An 1821 opinion of U.S. Attorney General William <unk> , interpreting Fletcher and Johnson , argued that : " The Seneca Indians must be protected in the enjoyment of exclusive possession of their lands , as defined and bounded in the Treaty of <unk> , until they have voluntarily relinquished it . " 
 Both the sovereignty over and land title to modern @-@ day western New York was disputed between the colonies , and then states , of New York and Massachusetts , both claiming the lands by virtue of their colonial charters . This dispute was resolved on December 16 , 1786 by the Treaty of Hartford , an <unk> compact providing that the lands would be part of the territory of New York , but Massachusetts would retain the pre @-@ <unk> rights , the exclusive right to purchase the Indian lands . The compact was approved by the Congress of the Confederation on October 8 , 1787 . 
 The New York Supreme Court General <unk> ( " circuit court " ) denied a new trial , holding that the payment of the appraisal value of the improvements determined by the <unk> was a condition precedent to the <unk> in the treaty . 
 Before the New York Court of Appeals , <unk> was represented by J. C. Spencer , who made three arguments . First , he argued that the right to bring an action for <unk> based on aboriginal title <unk> only to an Indian nation , not an individual Indian . As Spencer noted , the Seneca Nation itself was prohibited by law from bringing an action " by a private attorney . " Second , he argued that <unk> ' title was valid . Third , he argued that the Seneca 's rights under the treaty were only <unk> against the federal government , and did not affect the defendant 's title as a condition precedent . The court reporter did not publish Martindale 's responses . 
 The Court of Appeals , 6 @-@ 1 , sided with <unk> . Judge John Worth Edmonds delivered the majority opinion , joined by Chief Judge Charles H. <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> G. <unk> , Alexander S. Johnson , and Watson . Judge Welles <unk> and Judge <unk> was absent . 
 The Court of Appeals held that <unk> could independently bring the claim for <unk> , for which he need only show a right to possession . The Court of Appeals also held that <unk> ' title was invalid , because the payment of compensation was a condition precedent . Welles , in dissent , agreed that <unk> could individually sue for <unk> , but disagreed that the appraisal was a condition precedent ; he would have reversed and granted a new trial , with costs . The Court of Appeals <unk> back to the Supreme Court , after which a writ of error was granted by the U.S. Supreme Court . 
 John H. Martindale argued the case for the <unk> <unk> before the Court . Commissioner <unk> <unk> and <unk> Brown of the <unk> Land Company argued for the defendants . <unk> started on January 15 , 1857 and were <unk> until January 17 . 
 One of the <unk> , Ely S. Parker personally attended the oral arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court in Washington , D.C. According to the New York Times : 
 All who heard their cases argued before the Supreme Court of the United States , a few months since , will <unk> seeing this same Indian , and that he was well posted on the points he desired his counsel to press upon the attention of the Court . 
 A letter to the editor of the New York Times — which criticizes a previous article for creating the " impression that the Indians at <unk> are very nearly the equal in agriculture , general intelligence , and in the customs of <unk> life , of their white neighbors " — <unk> with this assessment of Parker 's role : 
 I have not a word to say in the <unk> of the intellectual ability of Ely S. Parker , their head chief , and <unk> unite with " <unk> " in <unk> him the credit for making valuable suggestions to his counsel on the argument of the case in the Supreme Court of the United States [ . ] Indeed , I am inclined to the belief , that to him is due the credit of originating and suggesting to his counsel the only available point in the case , and the one on which it was there decided , for the case had been ten years in the Courts of this State , and this point was never before made , nor was it made in the Supreme Court of the United States , in the original brief of counsel for the Indians , filed pursuant to the rules of the Court . It was first made in a supplementary brief printed after the opening argument of counsel on the other side had been commenced , and not handed in until the second day , just previous to its conclusion . 
 Chief Justice Roger <unk> was not present at the opinion announcement for <unk> because he was at home working on the opinion in <unk> Scott v. <unk> , which was announced the next day . The <unk> court had inherited from the preceding Marshall Court <unk> decisions on the status of aboriginal title in the United States . None of those decisions was cited in either opinion . <unk> Scott , in <unk> , opined the following on aboriginal title : 
 The situation of [ blacks ] was altogether unlike that of the Indian race . The latter . . . were situated in territories to which the white race claimed the ultimate right of dominion . But that claim was acknowledged to be subject to the right of the Indians to occupy it as long as they thought proper , and neither the English nor colonial Governments claimed or exercised any dominion over the tribe or nation by whom it was occupied , nor claimed the right to the possession of the territory , until the tribe or nation consented to cede it . 
 [ B ] <unk> Congress has express power to regulate commerce among the Indian tribes and to prohibit intercourse with the Indians , that therefore Dr. Emerson 's title might be defeated within the country ceded by the Indians to the United States as early as 1805 . . . . 
 Justice Samuel Nelson delivered the unanimous opinion of the Court , <unk> the judgment of the New York Court of Appeals . 
 Neither treaty made any provision as to the mode or manner in which the removal of the Indians or surrender of the reservations was to take place . The <unk> have assumed that they were authorized to take <unk> possession of the two reservations , or of the four , as the case would have been under the first treaty . The <unk> in this case was expelled by force ; and unless this mode of removal can be sustained , the recovery against the defendants for the <unk> was right , and must be affirmed . 
 The Court noted that previous <unk> of Indians had been undertaken by the federal government " according to the usage and practice of the Government , by its authority and under its care and <unk> . " " [ A ] <unk> other mode of a <unk> removal , " the Court argued , would not " be consistent with the peace of the country , or with the duty of the Government to these dependent people , who have been influenced by its counsel and authority to change their <unk> . " 
 Because the treaty had been negotiated " with them as a quasi nation , possessing some of the attributes of an independent people , and to be dealt with accordingly , " the Court held that " unless otherwise <unk> stipulated " only the federal government had the " authority or power " to execute the agreement . The Court remarked that the <unk> were " in a state of <unk> , and hold the relation to the Government as a ward to his guardian . " The nature of that relationship between the Seneca and the federal government was incompatible with the Seneca being expelled by " irregular force and violence , " or even " through the intervention of the courts of justice . " Thus , the court held that the private beneficiaries of Native American treaties could neither expel tribes by force or by a cause of action for <unk> . The court observed that " this interpretation is in accordance with the <unk> and practice of the Government in providing for the removal of Indian tribes from their ancient possessions , with the fitness and <unk> of the thing itself , " and with the text of the treaty . 
 The Court concluded : " We hold that the performance was not a duty that belonged to the <unk> , but for the Government under the treaty . " 
 The Court did not accept the <unk> ' arguments that the treaty was invalid because it was not signed by tribal leaders with the authority to cede the relevant lands or because the <unk> were <unk> induced to sign . <unk> to the enrolled bill rule ( the only citation of case law in the opinion ) , the Court held that " the treaty , after executed and ratified by the proper authorities of the Government , becomes the supreme law of the land , and the courts can no more go behind it for the purpose of <unk> its effect and operation . " 
 Because its aforementioned holdings required <unk> , the Court did not reach the alternate ground for decision of the trial court that the appraisal and the payments were conditions precedent . 
 Whereas <unk> was brought in the New York Supreme Court under the common law cause of action of <unk> , these three suits were brought ( as required by statute ) in the <unk> County Court under a state statute prohibiting non @-@ Indians from residing on Indian lands . That statute provided : 
 [ I ] t shall be unlawful for any person or persons , other than Indians , to settle or reside upon any lands belonging to or occupied by any nation or tribe of Indians within this state ; and that all <unk> , contracts and agreements made by any Indians , whereby any person or persons , other than Indians , shall be permitted to reside upon such lands , shall be absolutely void ; and if any person or persons shall settle or reside on any such lands , contrary to this act , it shall be the duty of any judge of any court of Common <unk> of the county within which such lands shall be situated , on complaint made to him , and on due proof of the fact of such settlement or residence , to issue his warrant , under his hand and seal , directed to the sheriff of such county , commanding him , within ten days after the <unk> <unk> , to remove such person or persons so settling or residing , with his , her or their families , from such lands . 
 that it shall be the duty of the district attorneys respectively of the several counties in this state in which any lands belonging to any Indian tribe shall be situated , ( among other things ) to make complaint of all <unk> upon Indian lands , forbidden by the act ; and from time to time to make inquiries whether any persons other than Indians are settled upon such lands , and to cause them to be removed in the manner <unk> prescribed . 
 The results of the three suits were mixed . Martindale was defeated in the New York Supreme Court and New York Court of Appeals , respectively , in the first two , but had prevailed in the Court of Appeals and , ultimately , the U.S. Supreme Court in the third . 
 Martindale ( in his final days as district attorney ) filed the complaint on January 8 , 1845 . Evidence , including the testimony of Ely S. Parker , was presented on January 11 . Judge Phineas L. Tracy , of the <unk> County Court ( 1841 – 1845 ) , declined to issue a warrant to the <unk> County Sheriff to remove the <unk> <unk> . 
 Still in January , Martindale applied to the Supreme Court for <unk> , and the court issued an alternative <unk> ( essentially , an order to show cause why <unk> <unk> should not issue ) on March 6 , 1845 , which was served March 25 . On April 19 , the deadline was extended to the first Tuesday in June . Before the Supreme Court , Martindale was joined by New York Attorney General John Van <unk> and opposed by A. <unk> and J. L. Brown . 
 That June , Judge <unk> granted Tracy 's motion to quash , without costs . The court held that only the district attorney could bring such an action to enforce the statute : 
 I am of opinion that by the terms and spirit of the statute under which this proceeding has been had , no other than the district attorney of the county of <unk> ( in which the lands intruded upon are situated ) could regularly be a relator . The remedy for the act complained of is provided by the statute , as well as the officers to carry it into execution . It is made the duty of the district attorney to make complaint of all <unk> upon Indian lands forbidden by the act , and from time to time to make inquiries whether any persons other than Indians are settled upon such lands , and to cause them to be removed in the manner <unk> prescribed . Without the act , John <unk> or any other person could not claim such summary proceedings to remove intruders upon Indian lands ; and with the act , no other person is authorized by its provisions to make complaint of such <unk> , or to cause the intruders to be removed , but the district attorney of the county in which the lands are situated . 
 The court also found the affidavit of Parker to be insufficient as a <unk> matter to comply with the terms of the statute . However , even if the district attorney had brought the action and the affidavit had been sufficient , the Supreme Court still would have denied <unk> as a matter of law . 
 In the second suit , Martindale — in a second term , this time as an elected district attorney — filed the complaint under the same statute on January 3 , 1849 . Judge Horace U. <unk> , of the <unk> County Court ( 1847 – 1850 ) , granted the writ of removal on January 9 , 1849 . The New York Supreme Court General <unk> ( <unk> Mullet , Sill , and Marvin ) , sitting in Buffalo , New York , granted a writ of certiorari , and affirmed in March 1849 . " <unk> " is the only party subject to the writ of removal named in the Court of Appeals opinion ( the only reported opinion ) and only by last name . 
 The Court of Appeals reversed and <unk> the writ in October 1852 . Judge John Worth Edmonds , for a unanimous court , gave two reasons . First , it held that the court had no power to proceed against the majority of the defendants because they were not properly summoned and caused to appear . Second , with respect to defendant <unk> ( who had voluntarily appeared ) , the court held that " it does not appear that these lands were owned by the Indians . " 
 The Court of Appeals — after the second argument — also affirmed in September 1857 . The majority opinion was authored by Judge Brown , joined by <unk> <unk> , Paige , Shankland , and Bowen . The Court of Appeals held that the state statute did not violate the New York Constitution and that a jury trial was not required because the defendants had no property right . In closing , the Court of Appeals cited the U.S. Supreme Court 's recent decision in <unk> . Chief Judge <unk> <unk> , joined by Judge Alexander S. Johnson , concurred on the <unk> of the 1821 state statute , but <unk> on the grounds that the treaties <unk> the aboriginal title , and thus the state statute either did not apply or violated the treaty . Judge Selden recused . 
 By the time <unk> was decided , <unk> had reached the U.S. Supreme Court but had not yet been argued . The Court eventually affirmed in 1858 , holding that the state statute did not violate the Indian Commerce <unk> , the federal <unk> Act , or the treaty . 
 The key claim advanced by lawyer John H. Martindale in all four cases had been that the Treaty of Buffalo Creek ( 1838 ) was invalid because it was not signed by the Seneca leaders with the authority to cede the <unk> <unk> , and the signatures it did contain were obtained by coercion or fraud . This argument had not prevailed before the New York Courts or the Supreme Court . As Brown notes : 
 The principal point , however , on which the counsel relied , and which he hoped to establish , was that the <unk> were not bound by the <unk> , because the chiefs there protested against and refused to sign them . To this point his main argument has always , in all stages of the litigation been addressed , and he has pressed it upon the consideration of the Courts , with the <unk> pertinacity . It was , however , decided against him in the <unk> case , argued last Winter at Washington and has never been decided in his favor by any Court . 
 <unk> is among the earliest cases where the Supreme Court applied treaties , including treaties between the United States and Native American tribes , as binding law . <unk> has been cited as authority for the enrolled treaty doctrine ; analogous to the enrolled bill rule for statutes , the enrolled treaty doctrine prevents inquiry into the legitimacy of the formation of treaties once ratified by the Senate . This doctrine was later used to deny relief ( or , to deny more relief ) to Native American tribes who claimed that treaties were entered into <unk> or signed by persons without authority to bind the tribe . <unk> was also decided before the Supreme Court began distinguishing between self @-@ executing and non @-@ self executing treaties . Regardless , treaties between the United States and Native Americans continued to be regarded as self @-@ executing . 
 A contemporary New York Times article opined that : " The questions involved are of great magnitude , and affect more or less the title to a large portion of the State of New York . " Although the Seneca prevailed in the lawsuit , title to a large portion of the state was not called into question due to the court 's refusal to entertain the Seneca 's claims regarding the invalidity of the treaty . According to Armstrong , the result of the decision was mixed : 
 The decision was not all that the Indians had hoped for — it was a victory on narrow legal grounds rather than a vindication of their cause — but it was a victory . The Court 's ruling meant that as long as the federal government was determined to take no action to remove them from <unk> , the <unk> Company was powerless to do so . 
 <unk> was " decided at a time when the government was still dealing with Indian tribes as if they were semi @-@ sovereign nations . " The <unk> Seneca were never relocated to Kansas , and a new 1857 treaty confirmed their title to a 7 @,@ 549 @-@ acre reservation . This treaty ended 15 years of litigation between the <unk> Band and the <unk> Land Company . 
 Plaintiff Ely S. Parker went on to become a member of General Ulysses S. Grant 's staff during the American Civil War , drawing up the terms of the surrender at <unk> Court House . After the war , President Grant appointed Parker as Commissioner of Indian Affairs , the first indigenous head of the Bureau of Indian Affairs . According to his New York Times obituary , Parker " negotiated the removal of his tribe from this State to the fertile and pleasant lands on Green Bay , Wisconsin . " 
 The Seneca 's lawyer , John H. Martindale , later appeared before the U.S. Supreme Court , as New York Attorney General , in In re New York Indians ( 1866 ) , arguing that the state had the right to tax the <unk> . The Court disagreed . In the case below , <unk> Joseph <unk> ( the defendant in <unk> ) , Louisa Troup , and George R. Babcock sought to recover a plot of land from Robert Denniston ( in his official capacity as New York State Comptroller ) and Thomas W. Olcott , the purchaser at the tax foreclosure sale . <unk> , Troup , and Babcock argued that the state had no power to tax the Seneca . In re New York Indians , agreeing , cited <unk> : 
 Until the Indians have sold their lands , and removed from them in pursuance of the treaty <unk> , they are to be regarded as still in their ancient possession , and are in under their original rights , and entitled to the undisturbed enjoyment of them . This was the effect of the decision in the case of <unk> v. <unk> . The time for the surrender of the possession , according to their consent given in the treaty , had not expired when these taxes were <unk> . The period within which the removal was to take place , under the treaty of 1838 , was five years from the time it went into effect . It was not proclaimed till 1840 , and under that of 1842 the time did not <unk> till 1846 . The taxation of the lands was premature and illegal . 
 Guitar Hero is a music rhythm video game developed by Harmonix and published by RedOctane for the PlayStation 2 video game console . It is the first entry in the Guitar Hero series . Guitar Hero was released on November 8 , 2005 in North America , April 7 , 2006 in Europe and June 15 , 2006 in Australia . The game 's development was a result of collaboration between RedOctane and Harmonix to bring a Guitar Freaks @-@ like game to America . 
 The game features a guitar @-@ shaped controller ( resembling a miniature Gibson SG ) that the player uses to simulate playing rock music . The gameplay is similar to GuitarFreaks , in that the player presses buttons on the guitar controller in time with musical notes that scroll on the game screen . The game features covers of 30 popular rock songs spanning five decades of rock , from the 1960s up through 2005 , in addition to bonus tracks . Guitar Hero became a surprise hit , earning critical acclaim and winning many awards from major video game publications , and was considered one of the most influential games of the first decade of the 21st century . The game 's success launched the Guitar Hero franchise , which has earned more than $ 2 billion in sales , spawning several sequels , expansions , and other game @-@ related products . 
 The gameplay is similar to other music and rhythm video games , in that the player must press buttons on a game controller in time with scrolling notes on the game screen to complete a song . The basic mechanics are based on Konami 's Guitar Freaks . In the case of Guitar Hero , the player may use either the guitar peripheral ( a 3 / 4 @-@ scale reproduction of the Gibson SG guitar as <unk> with the game , or a third @-@ party version ) or a standard controller to play the scrolling notes . The guitar peripheral has five different @-@ colored fret buttons near the nut of the guitar neck , and a strum bar and a whammy bar on the body of the guitar . The peripheral also has other buttons in order to navigate the game 's menus . Music is displayed on screen through a series of notes , matching in color and position to the fret buttons , that scroll down the screen on a fret board . To hit or play a note , the player must hold down the fret button corresponding to the note shown and toggle the strum bar at the same time as that note passes a marked area on the screen . Faster series of notes may be played on the guitar controller using hammer @-@ on and pull @-@ off techniques where the player does not need to strum each note . The game supports toggling the handedness of the guitar , allowing both left @-@ handed and right @-@ handed players to utilize the guitar controller . A player using the standard controller simply presses the buttons that correspond with the displayed notes as outlined in the game 's manual . 
 The player is awarded points for correctly hitting notes , chords and sustains . The player can also increase a score multiplier by playing a series of consecutive notes successfully . A " Rock Meter " tracks the player 's performance based on success or failure of hitting notes , and if the meter drops too low the song will prematurely end in failure for the player . The player can also earn " Star Power " by playing a series of glowing notes perfectly and using the whammy bar during sustains . Once the Star Power meter is filled at least halfway , Star Power can then be activated by briefly tilting the guitar controller vertically , or by pressing a specific button on a standard controller . Activating Star Power will double the scoring multiplier and makes it easier to increase the Rock Meter by playing correct notes . Thus , players can strategically use Star Power to play through difficult sections of a song they might have otherwise failed . 
 Guitar Hero 's main mode of play is Career Mode , where the player and in @-@ game band travel between various fictional performance arenas and perform sets of four or five songs . <unk> songs in this mode unlocks the songs for play within the other game modes . Players can choose their on @-@ stage character and their guitar ; these elements have no effect on gameplay but affect the visuals during the performance . In Career Mode , players can earn money from their performances that is redeemable at the in @-@ game store , where bonus content , such as additional songs , guitars and finishes , can be unlocked . Quick Play mode allows the player to play any unlocked track , selecting the difficulty , the character , venue and guitar . After successfully completing a song in either Career or Quick Play mode , the player is given a score and a rating between three @-@ five stars , depending on his or her overall performance . 
 Multiplayer mode offers two players the chance to compete against each other on the same song . Two fret boards will appear on screen , one for each player , as they alternate playing sections of the song in a dueling manner . The player with the highest score at the end of the song wins . 
 The four difficulty levels for each song afford the player a learning curve in order to help him or her progress in skill . The first difficulty level , Easy , only focuses on the first three fret buttons while displaying a significantly reduced amount of notes for the player to play . <unk> introduces a fourth fret button while adding more notes , and Hard includes the final fret button while adding additional notes . Expert does not introduce any other frets to learn , but adds more notes in a manner designed to challenge the player . 
 According to Rob Kay , the game 's Lead Designer , the idea of Guitar Hero was directly inspired by Konami 's Guitar Freaks arcade game , where the player used a guitar @-@ shaped controller to interact with the game . At the time , GuitarFreaks had not seen much exposure in North America . RedOctane was making dance pads for games like Dance Dance Revolution for home consoles and also operated an online video rental service similar to Netflix . RedOctane 's Kai and Charles Huang recognized the popularity of GuitarFreaks in Japan through their rental service , and planned to create guitar controllers to bring the game to North America . The Huangs raised $ 1 @.@ 75 million for the effort , despite being turned down by some investors who " thought [ the idea ] was too weird " . Greg Fischbach , one of the founders of Acclaim Entertainment , noted , <unk> several years later , they had passed on Guitar Hero , questioning " Who 's going to buy a peripheral like that ? " The Huangs approached Harmonix , who had previously made music video games such as <unk> , Amplitude and Karaoke Revolution about making a guitar @-@ based video game for those controllers . With a budget of about one million dollars ( which Kay noted was " pretty tiny for a video game " ) , the two companies worked together to develop Guitar Hero . Kay noted that " No one had any notions about it being a massive success ; we all just thought it would be fun to do . " Harmonix 's president Alex Rigopulos also claims that former Microsoft vice @-@ president of game publishing Ed Fries indirectly influenced the game 's creation , who had previously told Harmonix when they were pitching <unk> to Microsoft that no music @-@ rhythm game would succeed without custom hardware for it , prompting Rigopulos to investigate the Guitar Hero opportunity when it arose . 
 The team quickly recognized that " the controller really was the kind of magic sauce for what we wanted to do " . They identified three aspects of gameplay that they felt made the game stand out . These aspects included the note @-@ matching aspect and the showmanship created by the use of the whammy bar and tilting of the guitar within the game . The third key aspect was the use of Star Power " to provide a little more depth to the game — some replay value , some interest for people as they were playing beyond just hitting the notes " . Harmonix used third party controllers made for GuitarFreaks that were already on the market for development of the game until RedOctane had prepared prototypes for the Guitar Hero controller . The controller initially had pressure @-@ sensitive fret buttons to mimic the playing of a real guitar , but the idea was dropped as it made the gameplay too complex . The idea of using the whammy bar to boost Star Power , in addition to altering the pitch of sustained notes was only realized about a month before the completion of the game . The team had spent " precious development time and resources " into creating a free @-@ style model that would have allowed players to improvise during songs but ultimately cut it as they could not work the feature into the existing gameplay . 
 " Gem tracks " , the pattern of notes for a song , were developed by a team in Harmonix , taking usually a day to develop the tracks for one song . Tracks were designed to include key notes to " make [ the player ] feel as if [ he is ] a brilliant musician " . Software algorithms were used to assess the difficulty of the tracks , and the quality assurance team helped to rebalance the tracks for accuracy and difficulty . The software also allowed Harmonix to quickly make changes to the set list or to recreate the tracks for a song to make sure the overall difficulty of the game was appropriate . 
 At the onset of development , the team did not have any idea of what songs would be present in the final game . Kay noted that " We wanted 30 or 40 songs for the game and put a hundred on our wish list . " The game was to focus mostly on hard rock songs , but the team was limited by what could be licensed . The team also felt " morally <unk> " to include older , classic rock songs like The <unk> ' " I Wanna Be Sedated " to the younger target audience of the game . Harmonix had to modify the track list throughout development as certain songs were introduced or removed based on licensing issues , requiring the team to repeatedly balance difficulty and popularity of the track list . WaveGroup Sound were used to create the covers of the licensed songs provided in the game . Marcus Henderson of the band <unk> provided many of the lead guitar tracks for the covers . WaveGroup Sound also went to efforts to try to recreate effects for some songs . In the case of Black Sabbath 's " Iron Man " , the team learned that the vocal effects were created by having Ozzy Osbourne sing from behind a metal fan . The team sought out the same model of fan through Craigslist to generate the same effect in the game 's cover . Many of the bonus songs were from groups that Harmonix employees were part of or knew . Additionally , a " Be a Guitar Hero " contest was held allowing bands to submit their own song to be included in the game . The winning song was " Cheat on the Church " by Graveyard BBQ . Black Label Society 's song , " Fire it Up " , was included two weeks before the game was completed at the request of Zakk Wylde . The final song list was set very near to the shipping date . 
 Guitar Hero started with " super @-@ basic Pong @-@ style graphics " for the game display . The final game art was led by Ryan Lesser , using the art team 's involvement in the music scene . Based on the experience from <unk> and Amplitude , the team realized that " people don 't necessarily relate to really abstract visuals " , and included the depictions of live performances as previously used in Karaoke Revolution . House of Moves were used to assist in creation motion capture for the on @-@ screen animations . The appearance of Star Power was made to resemble electricity , both to reflect the use of the electric guitar as well to <unk> demonstrate the excitement of the performance and the virtual audience . 
 Guitar Hero was initially released to retail stores in a bundle that packaged the game disc and a Gibson SG guitar controller , priced at $ 69 @.@ 99 . Since its release , stand @-@ alone copies of the games and the guitar controller have been released , including both RedOctane and third @-@ party controllers from TAC and Nyko . <unk> , another controller company that has produced guitar controllers , was set to initially be part of the game 's development , creating a version of the game for the Xbox , but had to pull out due to a lawsuit by <unk> ; <unk> 's Darrel Richardson stated they had to pay $ 300 @,@ 000 to get out of their contract with RedOctane . 
 Guitar Hero features 47 playable songs , 30 of which are " main setlist " tracks that are covers of popular songs . Featured tracks include " Iron Man " by Black Sabbath , " Take Me Out " by Franz Ferdinand , " Spanish Castle Magic " by Jimi Hendrix , " <unk> at the Moon " by Ozzy Osbourne , " Smoke on the Water " by Deep Purple , " Crossroads " by Cream , and " Fat Lip " by Sum 41 . All cover tracks are credited on screen with the phrase " as made famous by " ( e.g. , " ' I Wanna Be Sedated ' , as made famous by The <unk> " ) . The other 17 songs are master recordings selected from indie groups . 
 Guitar Hero received critical acclaim upon release . It received a score of 91 @.@ 96 % on GameRankings and 91 / 100 on Metacritic . IGN praised the " fantastic soundtrack " and " great peripheral " , further commenting that mini @-@ Gibson SG controller " is what makes Guitar Hero , rather than what breaks it " . GameSpot echoed these sentiments , stating Guitar Hero had a " great guitar controller " and " killer soundtrack " and was possibly the " best rhythm game ever made " . Many reviews praised the game 's gradual learning curve and difficulty approach through the song tier progression and the difficulty setting for each song . Play said the game " gives bedroom air guitarists a chance to live out their rock ' n ' roll fantasies " . GameSpy 's review commented on the length of the songs , in that " once you hit the three minute mark or so , things start to feel ' too long ' " . Eurogamer said , " the lack of international star quality about the roster of songs and the absence of the original artists is perhaps the only thing that may <unk> from the package from an importer 's perspective " and " it would have been truly amazing with a better track list " . 
 Shortly after release , Guitar Hero became an unexpected hit ; it was the second @-@ highest @-@ selling PlayStation 2 title in February 2006 according to the <unk> Group . Game sales amounted to $ 45 million in 2005 . Since then , the game has sold about 1 @.@ 53 million copies through December 2007 . The success of the game has spawned a one billion dollar Guitar Hero franchise , including four sequels on several seventh generation consoles , seven expansions , a mobile phone @-@ based version , and a portable version for the Nintendo DS . Harmonix no longer is involved in development of the series , due to its acquisition by MTV . Harmonix has since developed Rock Band using designs similar to those that based Guitar Hero 's success . 
 The game and its sequels have created interest in young adults and children in learning how to play a real guitar , and has been considered as a " cultural phenomenon " that has created a significant cultural impact . At the end of 2009 , several journalists , including Wired , G4TV , CNN , the San Jose Mercury News , the Toronto Star , Inc . , The Guardian , and Advertising Age , considered Guitar Hero to be one of the most influential products of the first decade of the 21st century , attributing it as the spark leading to the growth of the rhythm game market , for <unk> music sales for both new and old artists , for introducing more social gaming concepts to the video game market , and , in conjunction with the Wii , for improving interactivity with gaming consoles . 
 Guitar Hero has won several awards . In IGN 's " Best of 2005 " , the game was recognized for " Best Music Game " , " Best PlayStation 2 Music Game " , " Best <unk> Soundtrack " , " Best <unk> Soundtrack for PlayStation 2 " , " Best Offline Multiplayer Game " , " Best PlayStation 2 Offline Multiplayer Game " , and " Best Gaming Peripheral " ( for the Mini Gibson SG controller ) . GameSpot also recognized the game in its " Best and <unk> of 2005 " , <unk> it honors for " Best Puzzle / Rhythm Game " , " Most Metal " , and " Reader 's Choice – Best Puzzle / Rhythm Game " . The Game Developers Choice Awards honored Guitar Hero for " Excellence in Audio " and " Excellence in Game Innovation " . The Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences ' 2005 Interactive Achievement Awards honored the game with awards for " Game of the Year " , " Outstanding Achievement in Game Design " , " Outstanding Achievement in Game Play Engineering " ( tie ) , and " Outstanding Achievement in Soundtrack " . Guitar Hero also won " Best Soundtrack " at the 2005 Spike TV Video Game Awards . 
 Steffen Peters ( born September 18 , 1964 ) is a German @-@ born <unk> who competes for the United States in <unk> . He has participated in three Olympic Games , winning a bronze medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics . Peters has been successful in numerous other international competitions , including winning team bronze at the 2006 World Equestrian Games , two individual bronze medals at the 2010 World Equestrian Games and individual and team gold at the 2011 Pan Am Games . The horse upon which he won many of his titles , Ravel , was retired in 2012 , and Peters is currently working with a new international competition horse , Legolas . 
 Peters was born in North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Germany . He began riding at age seven , and competing in weekend <unk> shows . By 15 , he was competing outside of Germany , at international competitions in Belgium and Denmark . He received his first horse , Udon , at age 16 as a gift from his father ; this horse would carry him to a bronze medal in the 1996 Summer Olympics . In 1984 , he spent the summer training in San Diego , California , before returning to Germany to perform his army service . In 1985 , he returned to the United States with Udon . In 1991 , he opened his own barn and acquired his first sponsor , Lila <unk> , who purchased Udon and as of 2012 owned a portion of Peters ' <unk> Del <unk> training barn . Peters gained his US citizenship in 1992 , saying , " The whole idea of being so patriotic , of feeling so close to one 's country makes a difference . There are not too many other countries where the people are so patriotic . I really enjoy this about America . " Peters continues to live in the San Diego area with his wife , Shannon . Their large <unk> barn is home to approximately 65 horses as of 2012 , around half of which the couple trains and the other half of which are in training under other riders . Outside of his competition and training schedule , he teaches in around 30 training <unk> each year . His staff call him " a machine " with regard to his training and competition schedule , and in addition to riding , he participates in swimming , cycling and tennis . 
 Peters ' show record before the 1992 Summer Olympics made him a hopeful to compete for the US team . However , his citizenship papers were not processed in time to compete in the Olympic trials , and so he did not compete in Barcelona . Peters won his first Olympic medal when he <unk> with the US <unk> team to a bronze medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta , together with Robert Dover , Michelle Gibson and Guenter Seidel . Peters , riding Floriano , was an alternate for the US team at the 2004 Summer Olympics , and did not compete . In 2006 , with an aging Floriano , Peters and the US team won bronze at the 2006 World Equestrian Games . Soon after , he began riding TC Ravel , who would become his most successful horse . Despite being gelded while in quarantine after his shipment from the Netherlands and suffering an injury in 2007 that prevented training , Ravel carried Peters to a qualification for the 2008 Summer Olympics . In individual <unk> competition at the Games , Peters placed fourth , riding Ravel . The US team finished fourth at the 2008 Games , but was disqualified after team member Courtney King 's horse tested positive for <unk> , a banned substance . In 2009 , Peters and Ravel had the highest scores in all three portions of the prestigious German Aachen World Equestrian Festival Grand Prix competition , leading them to be the first American pair to be named the Aachen Grand Prix Champions . 
 Ravel and Peters went on to win the 2009 World Cup Final , two bronze medals in individual competition at the 2010 World Equestrian Games , and be twice named the US Grand Prix Dressage Champions . In 2009 , The Chronicle of the Horse named Peters and Ravel Horse and Horseman of the Year , and the United States Equestrian Federation ( USEF ) named Ravel as Horse of the Year . At the time , the Chronicle called him a " natural athlete with a balanced seat and an inherent understanding of the horse . He 's calm under pressure and has a reputation for having ice water in his veins . " In 2011 , riding <unk> 's Magic , he took gold in both the team and individual <unk> events at the 2011 Pan Am Games . At the 2012 Summer Olympics he came 17th in the individual <unk> and was part of the US team which came 6th , again riding Ravel . Peters retired Ravel from competition after the 2012 Olympic Games , after over 40 Grand Prix wins , and the same year the horse was inducted into the United States Dressage Federation Hall of Fame . Peters ' new international competition horse is Legolas , currently the world 's top <unk> horse , and a prospect for the 2014 FEI World Equestrian Games , to be held in Normandy , France . 
 Peters is the first person to be awarded the USEF 's Equestrian of the Year Award three times , having won the honor in 2008 , 2009 and 2011 . 
 Gardner Lake is a small lake which borders the towns of Salem , Montville and <unk> in Connecticut . Named after the Gardner family which owned a large portion of the surrounding land , the 528 @-@ acre ( <unk> ha ) lake has been expanded in size with the construction of an earthen dam . Three state parks are located around Gardner Lake . Minnie Island State Park , the smallest state park , is a pine knoll . Hopemead State Park is a former campground that abuts the lake 's eastern shore . Gardner Lake State Park primarily serves as a boat launch and swimming area , but has been beset by problems with trash and vandalism since the area was improved in 2008 . Four campgrounds , a marina and dozens of private residences surround the lake . The lake is used for fishing and boating . 
 Gardner Lake is a natural lake and is named for the Gardner family which owned a large portion of the surrounding area , but the history of the lake itself is more identified as the site of " an extremely public miscalculation " . Thomas LeCount , a grocer from Niantic , Connecticut wanted to move his two @-@ story summer house from the south side of the lake to the east side of the lake , but believed that moving the house conventionally would be inefficient . LeCount raised up his fully furnished house and placed it on <unk> and waited until February 1895 when the lake was frozen . After moving the house about 300 feet ( 91 m ) off the south shore , the house <unk> sideways into a snowbank . The ice cracked as LeCount attempted to pull the house back , before abandoning the work at nightfall . That night , the mill operators utilized some of the lake 's water for power and made a gap between the ice and surface of the water , causing the house to crack through the ice and pitch over . LeCount 's summer home remained in this position until the spring <unk> where it came to rest in 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) of water with the second story and attic positioned above the water like a small lighthouse . For years , the house was the subject of children who fished off it in summer and ice <unk> through the house in the winter , but an enduring tale told by fishermen is that the house 's piano could be heard playing on quiet nights . By 2005 , the house was mostly rotted away . 
 Though Gardner Lake is a 528 @-@ acre ( <unk> ha ) natural lake that has been increased in size by the construction of a 168 feet ( 51 m ) earthen dam . The dam raises the water level up 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) to an average depth of 14 feet ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) . The area surrounding Gardner Lake has dozens of private homes , four campgrounds and a marina . 
 Gardner Lake State Park is a small 9 @.@ 75 @-@ acre ( 3 @.@ 95 ha ) Connecticut state park located on the south portion of the lake and provides access for fishing , swimming , and boating on the lake . <unk> to the state park list in 2001 , it expected to be open around 2002 and serves as one of the few public inland swimming areas <unk> dog <unk> the New London County area . 
 In 2001 , the State of Connecticut paid $ 550 @,@ 000 to acquire the parcel of land which became Lake Gardner State Park . The land was acquired from the estate of Carmine <unk> and returned a beach to public service that had been a private resort for 60 years . The Town of Salem had sought to acquire the land , but the citizens rejected the plan three times and a state funded grant was rejected in 1994 after the DEP announced the interest in acquiring the property for the state . In 2008 , the state spent about $ 1 million to pave the boat launch area and improve parking for 54 vehicles . In 2012 , the State of Connecticut was looking to institute parking fees for the park after it experienced several years of increased attendance and incidents in the park limits . Concerns included littering , unkempt toilets , swimmers going outside the designated zone and police arresting almost three times as many visitors from 2011 . In response to the issues , patrols were increased and additional signage was added to inform swimmers . The problems with trash problems and portable toilets ending up in the lake caused concerns for a local advocacy group , Friends of Gardner Lake , and the Gardner Lake Authority which has staff to attend the lake during peak hours . 
 Gardner Lake State Park is located off Connecticut Route 354 and features accessible parking , chemical toilets and a paved boat launch area . This state park designated area is primarily to provide boating and recreational access to the lake , though there is also a small beach for visitors to use . As of 2014 , the park does not have a parking fee . 
 Minnie Island State Park is a pine grown @-@ knoll that is located in the deepest portion of the lake . It is unmarked and undeveloped island that also is Connecticut 's smallest state park at 0 @.@ 88 acres . The island acquired its name when a local man declared it to be Minnie Island , because he took his wife , Minnie , to it for <unk> . Joseph Leary , author of A <unk> Landscape writes , " [ a ] s far back as anyone can remember , the island was a frequent landing place for boating parties and a great place for local children to explore . " The island was claimed by both the towns of Salem , Connecticut and Montville , Connecticut though it was not in the land records of either town . This went <unk> until a man attempted to purchase the island , and then made attempted to establish claim to the island . The man introduced a bill to authorize the sale by the state to establish title to the island , but instead the Connecticut General Assembly drafted and passed a bill to turn the island into a park . 
 Minnie Island State Park offers opportunities for picnicking and fishing to visitors who reach it by boat . Though the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection lists boating as an activity , which is redundant because the island is accessible by boat . The Oh Ranger website advises visitors of the tiny island to use a kayak to access the island because the island is heavily wooded and it is difficult to find a spot to dock . 
 Hopemead State Park is currently undeveloped 70 acre park on the eastern shore of the lake . The land was originally Solomon Gardner 's farm until it was purchased as a summer getaway by the Fuller family . The property was named Camp <unk> , an acronym from Fuller 's three daughters , and contained a house and an artist 's studio . Camp <unk> was used a boys camp for a number of years with permission by the Fuller family . It was later renamed Hopemead , literally " Hope Meadow " , by the Fuller daughters who believed it to be a sanctuary with spiritual overtones . In 1954 , the land was donated to the State of Connecticut to become a state park . The state found the land is unsuitable for development and demolished the dilapidated buildings , with the intention of letting Hopemead return to a natural state . Joseph Leary notes that the wildlife has <unk> in the area , but notes that the <unk> of noises and calls is simply " divine " . The park offers opportunities for hiking and fishing . 
 The Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection , now the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection has been <unk> the lake with walleye since 1993 . The walleye populations have been reported to be growing and they join the lake 's " excellent populations of bull head and catfish " . <unk> bass , largemouth bass , yellow perch are also found in the pond , but have been reported as " fair " reports and also good reports for trout . Local fishing tournaments also occur at Gardner Lake . As a result of the improvements to the boat launch area , boating and kayaking have increased greatly and police had to up the patrols at the lake . The area is patrolled by the Montville police and it costs the majority of annual budget , but the service was seen as beneficial to ensure the safety of boaters and enforcing the rules . 
 German submarine U @-@ 44 was a Type <unk> U @-@ boat of Nazi Germany 's Kriegsmarine that operated during World War II . She was ordered in November 1936 and laid down in September 1938 in <unk> . She was launched in August 1939 and commissioned in November . 
 During her service in the Kriegsmarine , U @-@ 44 conducted only two war patrols and sank a total of eight enemy vessels for a loss of 30 @,@ <unk> <unk> . On 13 March 1940 , she struck a mine that was located in field Number 7 off the north coast of the Netherlands . All 47 of her ' s crew members went down with the submarine . 
 U @-@ 44 was ordered by the Kriegsmarine on 21 November 1936 ( as part of Plan Z and in violation of the Treaty of Versailles ) . She was laid down on 15 September 1938 by AG <unk> , in <unk> as yard number 949 . U @-@ 44 was launched on 5 August 1939 and commissioned on 4 November of that same year under the command of <unk> Ludwig Mathes . 
 As one of the eight original German Type IX submarines , later designated <unk> , U @-@ 44 had a displacement of 1 @,@ 032 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 016 long tons ) when at the surface and 1 @,@ 153 tonnes ( 1 @,@ 135 long tons ) while submerged . The U @-@ boat had a total length of 76 @.@ 50 m ( 251 ft ) , a pressure hull length of 58 @.@ 75 m ( 192 ft 9 in ) , a beam of 6 @.@ 51 m ( 21 ft 4 in ) , a height of 9 @.@ 40 m ( 30 ft 10 in ) , and a draught of 4 @.@ 70 m ( 15 ft 5 in ) . The submarine was powered by two <unk> M 9 V 40 / 46 <unk> four @-@ stroke , nine @-@ cylinder diesel engines producing a total of 4 @,@ 400 metric horsepower ( 3 @,@ 240 kW ; 4 @,@ 340 shp ) for use while surfaced , two <unk> @-@ <unk> 2 <unk> 345 / 34 double @-@ acting electric <unk> producing a total of 1 @,@ 000 metric horsepower ( 740 kW ; 990 shp ) for use while submerged . She had two shafts and two 1 @.@ 92 m ( 6 ft ) propellers . The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to 230 metres ( 750 ft ) . 
 The submarine had a maximum surface speed of 18 @.@ 2 knots ( 33 @.@ 7 km / h ; 20 @.@ 9 mph ) and a maximum submerged speed of 7 @.@ 7 knots ( 14 @.@ 3 km / h ; 8 @.@ 9 mph ) . When submerged , the boat could operate for 65 – 78 nautical miles ( 120 – 144 km ; 75 – 90 mi ) at 4 knots ( 7 @.@ 4 km / h ; 4 @.@ 6 mph ) ; when surfaced , she could travel 10 @,@ 500 nautical miles ( 19 @,@ 400 km ; 12 @,@ 100 mi ) at 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . U @-@ 44 was fitted with six 53 @.@ 3 cm ( 21 in ) torpedo tubes ( four fitted at the bow and two at the stern ) , 22 torpedoes , one 10 @.@ 5 cm ( 4 @.@ 13 in ) SK C / 32 naval gun , 180 rounds , and a 3 @.@ 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) as well as a 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) anti @-@ aircraft gun . The boat had a complement of forty @-@ eight . 
 U @-@ 44 had a very short operational life . During her service with the Kriegsmarine , she took part in only two combat patrols . After training exercises with the 6th U @-@ boat Flotilla from 4 November to 31 December 1939 , U @-@ 44 was assigned as the front boat for the 2nd U @-@ boat Flotilla on 1 January 1940 . She was to remain a part of this flotilla until her loss . 
 The first of U @-@ 44 's two patrols began on 6 January 1940 when she left Wilhelmshaven for the North Sea , eventually circumnavigating the British Isles , travelling as far south as the Bay of Biscay and Portugal . It was in these two locations that U @-@ 44 sank her first ( and last ) merchant ships . Following these victories , she headed north again , travelling just north of the coast of Scotland and back into the North Sea . She then returned to Wilhelmshaven , arriving there on 9 February 1940 . Over a period of thirty @-@ five days , U @-@ 44 sank eight merchant ships , for a total loss of 30 @,@ <unk> <unk> . 
 Unlike her first outing , U @-@ 44 's second patrol was a disaster , not even lasting through the first day . After spending more than a month in Wilhelmshaven , she began her second patrol on 13 March 1940 . A few hours after leaving port , U @-@ 44 entered minefield Number 7 , just off of the northern coast of the Netherlands . This particular minefield was laid by the British destroyers HMS Esk , Express , Icarus , Faulknor and Impulsive . Upon entering the minefield , U @-@ 44 struck one of the devices and sank at 54 ° 14 ′ N 5 ° 07 ′ E. All forty @-@ seven of her crew were lost . 
 During her service , U @-@ 44 sank eight commercial ships for a loss of 30 @,@ <unk> <unk> . All of these ships were sunk during her first patrol . 
 Group 3 is a group of elements in the periodic table . This group , like other d @-@ block groups , should contain four elements , but it is not agreed what elements belong in the group . Scandium ( Sc ) and yttrium ( Y ) are always included , but the other two spaces are usually occupied by lanthanum ( La ) and <unk> ( Ac ) , or by lutetium ( Lu ) and lawrencium ( Lr ) ; less frequently , it is considered the group should be expanded to 32 elements ( with all the lanthanides and actinides included ) or contracted to contain only scandium and yttrium . The group itself has not acquired a trivial name ; however , scandium , yttrium and the lanthanides are sometimes called rare earth metals . 
 Three group 3 elements occur naturally , scandium , yttrium , and either lanthanum or lutetium . Lanthanum continues the trend started by two lighter members in general chemical behavior , while lutetium behaves more similarly to yttrium . This is in accordance with the trend for period 6 transition metals to behave more similarly to their upper periodic table neighbors . This trend is seen from hafnium , which is almost identical chemically to zirconium , to mercury , which is quite distant chemically from cadmium , but still shares with it almost equal atomic size and other similar properties . They all are silvery @-@ white metals under standard conditions . The fourth element , either <unk> or lawrencium , has only radioactive isotopes . <unk> , which occurs only in trace amounts , continues the trend in chemical behavior for metals that form tripositive ions with a noble gas configuration ; synthetic lawrencium is calculated and partially shown to be more similar to lutetium and yttrium . So far , no experiments have been conducted to synthesize any element that could be the next group 3 element . <unk> ( Ubu ) , which could be considered a group 3 element if preceded by lanthanum and <unk> , might be synthesized in the near future , it being only three spaces away from the current heaviest element known , ununoctium . 
 In 1787 , Swedish part @-@ time chemist Carl Axel Arrhenius found a heavy black rock near the Swedish village of Ytterby , Sweden ( part of the Stockholm Archipelago ) . <unk> that it was an unknown mineral containing the newly discovered element tungsten , he named it ytterbite . Finnish scientist Johan Gadolin identified a new oxide or " earth " in Arrhenius ' sample in 1789 , and published his completed analysis in 1794 ; in 1797 , the new oxide was named yttria . In the decades after French scientist Antoine Lavoisier developed the first modern definition of chemical elements , it was believed that <unk> could be reduced to their elements , meaning that the discovery of a new earth was equivalent to the discovery of the element within , which in this case would have been yttrium . Until the early 1920s , the chemical symbol " <unk> " was used for the element , after which " Y " came into common use . Yttrium metal was first isolated in 1828 when Friedrich Wöhler heated anhydrous yttrium ( III ) chloride with potassium to form metallic yttrium and potassium chloride . 
 In 1869 , Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev published his periodic table , which had empty spaces for elements directly above and under yttrium . Mendeleev made several predictions on the upper neighbor of yttrium , which he called eka @-@ boron . Swedish chemist Lars Fredrik Nilson and his team discovered the missing element in the minerals euxenite and gadolinite and prepared 2 grams of scandium ( III ) oxide of high purity . He named it scandium , from the Latin Scandia meaning " Scandinavia " . Chemical experiments on the element proved that Mendeleev 's suggestions were correct ; along with discovery and characterization of gallium and germanium this proved the <unk> of the whole periodic table and periodic law . Nilson was apparently unaware of Mendeleev 's prediction , but Per Teodor Cleve recognized the correspondence and notified Mendeleev . Metallic scandium was produced for the first time in 1937 by electrolysis of a eutectic mixture , at 700 – 800 ° C , of potassium , lithium , and scandium chlorides . 
 Lutetium was independently discovered in 1907 by French scientist Georges <unk> , Austrian mineralogist Baron Carl Auer von Welsbach , and American chemist Charles James as an impurity in the mineral ytterbia , which was thought by most chemists to consist entirely of ytterbium . Welsbach proposed the names cassiopeium for element 71 ( after the constellation Cassiopeia ) and aldebaranium ( after the star Aldebaran ) for the new name of ytterbium but these naming proposals were rejected , although many German scientists in the 1950s called the element 71 cassiopeium . <unk> chose the names neoytterbium ( Latin for " new ytterbium " ) for ytterbium and lutecium ( from Latin Lutetia , for Paris ) for the new element . The dispute on the priority of the discovery is documented in two articles in which <unk> and von Welsbach accuse each other of publishing results influenced by the published research of the other . The Commission on Atomic Mass , which was responsible for the attribution of the names for the new elements , settled the dispute in 1909 by granting priority to <unk> and adopting his names as official ones . An obvious problem with this decision was that <unk> was one of the four members of the commission . The separation of lutetium from ytterbium was first described by <unk> and the naming honor therefore went to him , but neoytterbium was eventually reverted to ytterbium and in 1949 , the spelling of element 71 was changed to lutetium . Ironically , Charles James , who had <unk> stayed out of the argument as to priority , worked on a much larger scale than the others , and undoubtedly possessed the largest supply of lutetium at the time . 
 Lawrencium was first synthesized by the Albert Ghiorso and his team on February 14 , 1961 , at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory ( now called the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ) at the University of California in Berkeley , California , United States . The first atoms of lawrencium were produced by bombarding a three @-@ milligram target consisting of three isotopes of the element californium with boron @-@ 10 and boron @-@ 11 nuclei from the Heavy Ion Linear Accelerator ( HILAC ) . The nuclide 257103 was originally reported , but then this was reassigned to 258103 . The team at the University of California suggested the name lawrencium ( after Ernest O. Lawrence , the inventor of cyclotron particle accelerator ) and the symbol " Lw " , for the new element , but " Lw " was not adopted , and " Lr " was officially accepted instead . Nuclear @-@ physics researchers in Dubna , Soviet Union ( now Russia ) , reported in 1967 that they were not able to confirm American scientists ' data on 257103 . Two years earlier , the Dubna team reported 256103 . In 1992 , the IUPAC Trans @-@ fermium Working Group officially recognized element 103 , confirmed its naming as lawrencium , with symbol " Lr " , and named the nuclear physics teams at Dubna and Berkeley as the co @-@ discoverers of lawrencium . 
 So far , no experiments were conducted to synthesize any element that could be the next group 3 element ; if lutetium and lawrencium are considered to be group 3 elements , then the next element in the group should be element 153 , unpenttrium ( <unk> ) . However , after element 120 , filling electronic <unk> stops obeying Aufbau principle . According to the principle , unpenttrium should have an electronic configuration of [ Uuo ] <unk> and filling the 5g @-@ subshell should be stopped at element 138 . However , the 7d @-@ orbitals are calculated to start being filled on element 137 , while the 5g @-@ subshell closes only at element 144 , after filling of 7d @-@ subshell begins . Therefore , it is hard to calculate which element should be the next group 3 element . Calculations suggest that <unk> ( Upp , element 155 ) could also be the next group 3 element . If lanthanum and <unk> are considered group 3 elements , then element 121 , unbiunium ( Ubu ) , should be the fifth group 3 element . The element is calculated have electronic configuration of [ Uuo ] <unk> / 21 , which is not associated with transition metals , without having a partially filled d @-@ subshell . No experiments have been performed to create unpenttrium , unbiunium or any element that could be considered the next group 3 element ; however , unbiunium is the element with the lowest atomic number that has not been tried to be created and thus has chances to be , while unpenttrium , <unk> or any other element considered if preceded by lawrencium is very unlikely to be created due to drip <unk> that imply that the periodic table ends soon after the island of stability at <unk> . 
 Like other groups , the members of this family show patterns in their electron <unk> , especially the outermost shells , resulting in trends in chemical behavior . However , lawrencium is an exception , since its last electron is transferred to the 7p1 / 2 subshell due to <unk> effects . 
 Most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first three members of the group ; chemical properties of both <unk> and especially lawrencium are not well @-@ characterized . The remaining elements of the group ( scandium , yttrium , lutetium ) are reactive metals with high melting points ( <unk> ° C , 1526 ° C , 1652 ° C respectively ) . They are usually <unk> to the + 3 oxidation state , even through scandium , yttrium and lanthanum can form lower oxidation states . The reactivity of the elements , especially yttrium , is not always obvious due to the formation of a stable oxide layer , which prevents further reactions . Scandium ( III ) oxide , yttrium ( III ) oxide , lanthanum ( III ) oxide and lutetium ( III ) oxide are white high @-@ temperature @-@ melting solids . Yttrium ( III ) oxide and lutetium ( III ) oxide exhibit weak basic character , but scandium ( III ) oxide is amphoteric . Lanthanum ( III ) oxide is strongly basic . 
 Elements that show tripositive ions with electronic configuration of a noble gas ( scandium , yttrium , lanthanum , <unk> ) show a clear trend in their physical properties , such as hardness . At the same time , if group 3 is continued with lutetium and lawrencium , several trends are broken . For example , scandium and yttrium are both soft metals . Lanthanum is soft as well ; all these elements have their outermost electrons quite far from the nucleus compared to the nuclei charges . Due to the lanthanide contraction , lutetium , the last in the lanthanide series , has a significantly smaller atomic radius and a higher nucleus charge , thus making the extraction of the electrons from the atom to form metallic bonding more difficult , and thus making the metal harder . However , lutetium suits the previous elements better in several other properties , such as melting and boiling points . Very little is known about lawrencium , and none of its physical properties have been confirmed . 
 It is disputed whether lutetium and lawrencium should be included in group 3 , rather than lanthanum and <unk> . Other d @-@ block groups are composed of four transition metals , and group 3 is sometimes considered to follow suit . Scandium and yttrium are always classified as group 3 elements , but it is controversial which elements should follow them in group 3 , lanthanum and <unk> or lutetium and lawrencium . Scerri has proposed a resolution to this debate on the basis of moving to a 32 @-@ column table and consideration of which option results in a continuous sequence of atomic number increase . He thereby finds that group 3 should consist of Sc , Y , Lu , Lr . The current IUPAC definition of the term " <unk> " includes fifteen elements including both lanthanum and lutetium , and that of " transition element " applies to lanthanum and <unk> , as well as lutetium but not lawrencium , since it does not correctly follow the Aufbau principle . Normally , the 103rd electron would enter the d @-@ subshell , but quantum mechanical research has found that the configuration is actually [ <unk> ] <unk> due to <unk> effects . IUPAC thus has not recommended a specific format for the in @-@ line @-@ f @-@ block periodic table , leaving the dispute open . 
 Lanthanum and <unk> are sometimes considered the remaining members of group 3 . In their most commonly encountered tripositive ion forms , these elements do not possess any partially filled f @-@ orbitals , thus continuing the scandium — yttrium — lanthanum — <unk> trend , in which all the elements have relationship similar to that of elements of the calcium — strontium — barium — <unk> series , the elements ' left neighbors in s @-@ block . However , different behavior is observed in other d @-@ block groups , especially in group 4 , in which zirconium , hafnium and rutherfordium share similar chemical properties lacking a clear trend . 
 In other tables , lutetium and lawrencium are classified as the remaining members of group 3 . In these tables , lutetium and lawrencium end ( or sometimes succeed ) the lanthanide and actinide series , respectively . Since the f @-@ shell is nominally full in the ground state electron configuration for both of these metals , they behave most similarly to other period 6 and period 7 transition metals compared to the other lanthanides and actinides , and thus logically exhibit properties similar to those of scandium and yttrium . 
 Some tables , including the official IUPAC table refer to all lanthanides and actinides by a marker in group 3 . This sometimes is believed to be the inclusion of all 30 lanthanide and actinide elements as included in group 3 . <unk> , as electropositive trivalent metals , all have a closely related chemistry , and all show many similarities to scandium and yttrium , but they also show additional properties characteristic of their partially filled f @-@ orbitals which are not common to scandium and yttrium . 
 Exclusion of all elements is based on properties of earlier actinides , which show a much wider variety of chemistry ( for instance , in range of oxidation states ) within their series than the lanthanides , and comparisons to scandium and yttrium are even less useful . However , these elements are <unk> , and if they were stabilized to more closely match chemistry laws , they would be similar to lanthanides as well . Also , the later actinides from californium onwards behave more like the corresponding lanthanides , with only the valence + 3 ( and sometimes + 2 ) shown . 
 Scandium , yttrium , and lutetium tend to occur together with other lanthanides ( except promethium ) tend to occur together in the Earth 's crust , and are often harder to extract from their ores . The abundance of elements in Earth 's crust for group 3 is quite low — all the elements in the group are uncommon , the most abundant being yttrium with abundance of approximately 30 parts per million ( ppm ) ; the abundance of scandium is 16 ppm , while that of lutetium is about 0 @.@ 5 ppm . For comparison , the abundance of copper is 50 ppm , that of chromium is 160 ppm , and that of molybdenum is 1 @.@ 5 ppm . 
 Scandium is distributed sparsely and occurs in trace amounts in many minerals . Rare minerals from Scandinavia and Madagascar such as gadolinite , euxenite , and thortveitite are the only known concentrated sources of this element , the latter containing up to 45 % of scandium in the form of scandium ( III ) oxide . Yttrium has the same trend in occurrence places ; it is found in lunar rock samples collected during the American Apollo Project in a relatively high content as well . 
 The principal commercially viable ore of lutetium is the rare earth phosphate mineral monazite , ( Ce , La , etc . ) PO4 , which contains 0 @.@ 003 % of the element . The main mining areas are China , United States , Brazil , India , Sri Lanka and Australia . Pure lutetium metal is one of the rarest and most expensive of the rare earth metals with the price about US $ 10 @,@ 000 / kg , or about one @-@ fourth that of gold . 
 The most available element in group 3 is yttrium , with annual production of 8 @,@ 900 tonnes in 2010 . Yttrium is mostly produced as oxide , by a single country , China ( 99 % ) . Lutetium and scandium are also mostly obtained as oxides , and their annual production by 2001 was about 10 and 2 tonnes , respectively . 
 Group 3 elements are mined only as a byproduct from the extraction of other elements . The metallic elements are extremely rare ; the production of metallic yttrium is about a few tonnes , and that of scandium is in the order of 10 kg per year ; production of lutetium is not calculated , but it is certainly small . The elements , after purification from other rare earth metals , are isolated as oxides ; the oxides are converted to fluorides during reactions with hydrofluoric acid . The resulting fluorides are reduced with alkaline earth metals or alloys of the metals ; metallic calcium is used most frequently . For example : 
 Group 3 elements are generally hard metals with low aqueous solubility , and have low availability to the <unk> . No group 3 element has any documented biological role in living organisms . The <unk> of the actinides generally makes them highly toxic to living cells , causing radiation poisoning . 
 Scandium has no biological role , but it is found in living organisms . Once reached a human , scandium concentrates in the liver and is a threat to it ; some its compounds are possibly carcinogenic , even through in general scandium is not toxic . Scandium is known to have reached the food chain , but in trace amounts only ; a typical human takes in less than 0 @.@ 1 micrograms per day . Once released into the environment , scandium gradually <unk> in soils , which leads to increased concentrations in soil particles , animals and humans . Scandium is mostly dangerous in the working environment , due to the fact that damps and gases can be inhaled with air . This can cause lung embolisms , especially during long @-@ term exposure . The element is known to damage cell membranes of water animals , causing several negative influences on reproduction and on the functions of the nervous system . 
 Yttrium has no known biological role , though it is found in most , if not all , organisms and tends to concentrate in the liver , kidney , spleen , lungs , and bones of humans . There is normally as little as 0 @.@ 5 milligrams found within the entire human body ; human breast milk contains 4 ppm . Yttrium can be found in edible plants in concentrations between 20 ppm and 100 ppm ( fresh weight ) , with cabbage having the largest amount . With up to 700 ppm , the seeds of woody plants have the highest known concentrations . 
 Lutetium has no biological role as well , but it is found even in the highest known organism , the humans , concentrating in bones , and to a lesser extent in the liver and <unk> . Lutetium salts are known to cause metabolism and they occur together with other lanthanide salts in nature ; the element is the least abundant in the human body of all lanthanides . Human diets have not been monitored for lutetium content , so it is not known how much the average human takes in , but estimations show the amount is only about several micrograms per year , all coming from tiny amounts taken by plants . Soluble lutetium salts are <unk> toxic , but insoluble ones are not . 
 The high <unk> of lawrencium would make it highly toxic to living cells , causing radiation poisoning .
